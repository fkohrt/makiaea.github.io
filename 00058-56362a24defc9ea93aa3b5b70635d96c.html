<p><em>tdp-43 and rna form amyloid-like myo-granules in regenerating muscle</em><br />

<p>“The researchers believe it could ultimately open new avenues for treating musculoskeletal diseases and also lend new understanding to related neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, in which different amyloids play a role.<br />
“Many of these degenerative diseases share a similar scenario in which they have these protein aggregates that accumulate in the cell and gum up the system,” said co-first author Joshua Wheeler, also an M.D./PhD candidate in the Department of Biochemistry. “As these aggregates are beneficial for normal regeneration, our data suggest that the cell is just damaged and trying to repair itself.”<br />
For the study, Vogler and MCDB professor Brad Olwin, who study muscle generation, teamed up with Wheeler and Roy Parker, who study RNA, to investigate a protein called TDP-43.<br />
TDP-43 has long been suspected to be a culprit in disease, having been found in the skeletal muscle of people with inclusion body myopathy and the neurons of people with ALS. But when the researchers closely examined muscle tissue growing in culture in the lab, they discovered clumps of TDP-43 were present not only in diseased tissue but also in healthy tissue.<br />
“That was astounding,” said Olwin. “These amyloid-like aggregates, which we thought were toxic, seemed to be a normal part of muscle formation, appearing at a certain time and then disappearing again once the muscle was formed.”<br />
Subsequent studies in muscle tissue growing in culture showed that when the gene that codes for TDP-43 was knocked out, muscles didn’t grow. When the researchers looked at human tissue biopsied from healthy people whose muscles were regenerating, they found aggregates, or “myo-granules,” of TDP-43. Further RNA-protein mapping analysis showed that the clusters — like shipping trucks traveling throughout the cell — appear to carry instructions for how to build contractile muscle fibers.<br />
Wheeler and Vogler, both competitive runners and long-time friends, came up with the initial idea for the study while on a trail run. Wheeler says the data suggest that when healthy athletes push their muscles hard via things like marathons and ultramarathons, they are probably also forming amyloid-like clusters within their cells.<br />
The key question remains: Why do most people quickly clear these proteins while others do not, with. the granules — like sugar cubes that won’t dissolve — clustering together and causing disease?<br />
“If they normally form and go away, something is making them dissolve,” said Olwin. “Figuring out the mechanisms involved could potentially open a new avenue for treatments.”<br />
The team is also interested in exploring whether a similar process may occur in the brain after injury, kick-starting disease. And subsequent studies will go even further to identify what the protein clusters do.<br />
“This is a great example of how collaboration across disciplines can lead to really important work,” said Parker.”</p>

<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> A dominant histopathological feature in neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy, is cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. Although rare mutations in TARDBP—the gene that encodes TDP-43—that lead to protein misfolding often cause protein aggregation, most patients do not have any mutations in TARDBP. Therefore, aggregates of wild-type TDP-43 arise in most patients by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that TDP-43 is an essential protein for normal skeletal muscle formation that unexpectedly forms cytoplasmic, amyloid-like oligomeric assemblies, which we call myo-granules, during regeneration of skeletal muscle in mice and humans. Myo-granules bind to mRNAs that encode sarcomeric proteins and are cleared as myofibres mature. Although myo-granules occur during normal skeletal-muscle regeneration, myo-granules can seed TDP-43 amyloid fibrils in vitro and are increased in a mouse model of inclusion body myopathy. Therefore, increased assembly or decreased clearance of functionally normal myo-granules could be the source of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates that commonly occur in neuromuscular disease.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. “Lactate shuttle” (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a “strain” and not a “stress” biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review.</li>

<ul>
<li>Physical models typically assume time-independent interactions, whereas neural networks and machine learning incorporate interactions that function as adjustable parameters. Here we demonstrate a new type of abundant cooperative nonlinear dynamics where learning is attributed solely to the nodes, instead of the network links which their number is significantly larger. The nodal, neuronal, fast adaptation follows its relative anisotropic (dendritic) input timings, as indicated experimentally, similarly to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the links, synapses. It represents a non-local learning rule, where effectively many incoming links to a node concurrently undergo the same adaptation. The network dynamics is now counterintuitively governed by the weak links, which previously were assumed to be insignificant. This cooperative nonlinear dynamic adaptation presents a self-controlled mechanism to prevent divergence or vanishing of the learning parameters, as opposed to learning by links, and also supports self-oscillations of the effective learning parameters. It hints on a hierarchical computational complexity of nodes, following their number of anisotropic inputs and opens new horizons for advanced deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications, as well as a new mechanism for enhanced and fast learning by neural networks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intrusive memories, images, and hallucinations are hallmark symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Although often attributed to deficient inhibitory control by the prefrontal cortex, difficulty in controlling intrusive thoughts is also associated with hippocampal hyperactivity, arising from dysfunctional GABAergic interneurons. How hippocampal GABA contributes to stopping unwanted thoughts is unknown. Here we show that GABAergic inhibition of hippocampal retrieval activity forms a key link in a fronto-hippocampal inhibitory control pathway underlying thought suppression. Subjects viewed reminders of unwanted thoughts and tried to suppress retrieval while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Suppression reduced hippocampal activity and memory for suppressed content. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that greater resting concentrations of hippocampal GABA predicted better mnemonic control. Higher hippocampal, but not prefrontal GABA, predicted stronger fronto-hippocampal coupling during suppression, suggesting that interneurons local to the hippocampus implement control over intrusive thoughts. Stopping actions did not engage this pathway. These findings specify a multi-level mechanistic model of how the content of awareness is voluntarily controlled.</li>

<p><em>a fluid-to-solid jamming transition underlies vertebrate body axis elongation</em><br />

<p>Cells coordinate by exchanging biochemical signals, but they also hold to and push on each other to build the body structures we need to live, such as the eyes, lungs and heart. And, as it turns out, sculpting the embryo is not far from glass molding or 3D printing. In their new work,”A fluid-to-solid jamming transition underlies vertebrate body axis elongation,” published in the journal <em>Nature</em>, Campàs and colleagues reveal that cell collectives switch from fluid to solid states in a controlled manner to build the vertebrate embryo, in a way similar to how we mold glass into vases or 3D print our favorite items. Or, if you like, we 3D print ourselves, from the inside.<br />
Most objects begin as fluids. From metallic structures to gelatin desserts, their shape is made by pouring the molten original materials into molds, then cooling them to get the solid objects we use. As in a Chihuly glass sculpture, made by carefully melting portions of glass to slowly reshape it into life, cells in certain regions of the embryo are more active and ‘melt’ the tissue into a fluid state that can be restructured. Once done, cells ‘cool down’ to settle the tissue shape, Campàs explained.<br />
“The transition from fluid to solid tissue states that we observed is known in physics as ‘jamming’,” Campàs said. “Jamming transitions are a very general phenomena that happens when particles in disordered systems, such as foams, emulsions or glasses, are forced together or cooled down.”<br />
This discovery was enabled by techniques previously developed by Campàs and his group to measure the forces between cells inside embryos, and also to exert miniscule forces on the cells as they build tissues and organs. Using zebrafish embryos, favored for their optical transparency but developing much like their human counterparts, the researchers placed tiny droplets of a specially engineered ferromagnetic fluid between the cells of the growing tissue. The spherical droplets deform as the cells around them push and pull, allowing researchers to see the forces that cells apply on each other. And, by making these droplets magnetic, they also could exert tiny stresses on surrounding cells to see how the tissue would respond.<br />
“We were able to measure physical quantities that couldn’t be measured before, due to the challenge of inserting miniaturized probes in tiny developing embryos,” said postdoctoral fellow Alessandro Mongera, who is the lead author of the paper.<br />
“Zebrafish, like other vertebrates, start off from a largely shapeless bunch of cells and need to transform the body into an elongated shape, with the head at one end and tail at the other,” Campàs said. The physical reorganization of the cells behind this process had always been something of a mystery. Surprisingly, researchers found that the cell collectives making the tissue were physically like a foam (yes, as in beer froth) that jammed during development to ‘freeze’ the tissue architecture and set its shape.<br />
These observations confirm a remarkable intuition made by Victorian-era Scottish mathematician D’Arcy Thompson 100 years ago in his seminal work “On Growth and Form.”<br />
“He was convinced that some of the physical mechanisms that give shapes to inert materials were also at play to shape living organisms. Remarkably, he compared groups of cells to foams and even the shaping of cells and tissues to glassblowing,” Campàs said. A century ago, there were no instruments that could directly test the ideas Thompson proposed, Campàs added, though Thompson’s work continues to be cited to this day.<br />
The new <em>Nature</em> paper also provides a jumping-off point from which the Campàs Group researchers can begin to address other processes of embryonic development and related fields, such as how tumors physically invade surrounding tissues and how to engineer organs with specific 3D shapes.<br />
“One of the hallmarks of cancer is the transition between two different tissue architectures. This transition can in principle be explained as an anomalous switch from a solid-like to a fluid-like tissue state,” Mongera explained. “The present study can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying this switch and highlight some of the potential druggable targets to hinder it.”</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Just as in clay moulding or glass blowing, physically sculpting biological structures requires the constituent material to locally flow like a fluid while maintaining overall mechanical integrity like a solid. Disordered soft materials, such as foams, emulsions and colloidal suspensions, switch from fluid-like to solid-like behaviours at a jamming transition1,2,3,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR4">7</a>. Similarly, cell collectives have been shown to display glassy dynamics in 2D and 3D<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR5">8</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR6">9</a> and jamming in cultured epithelial monolayers<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR7">10</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR8">11</a>, behaviours recently predicted theoretically9,10,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR11">11</a> and proposed to influence asthma pathobiology<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR8">11</a> and tumour progression<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR12">12</a>. However, little is known about whether these seemingly universal behaviours occur in vivo<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0479-2#ref-CR13">13</a> and, specifically, whether they play any functional part during embryonic morphogenesis. Here, by combining direct in vivo measurements of tissue mechanics with analysis of cellular dynamics, we show that during vertebrate body axis elongation, posterior tissues undergo a jamming transition from a fluid-like behaviour at the extending end, the mesodermal progenitor zone, to a solid-like behaviour in the presomitic mesoderm. We uncover an anteroposterior, N-cadherin-dependent gradient in yield stress that provides increasing mechanical integrity to the presomitic mesoderm, consistent with the tissue transiting from a wetter to a dryer foam-like architecture. Our results show that cell-scale stresses fluctuate rapidly (within about 1 min), enabling cell rearrangements and effectively ‘melting’ the tissue at the growing end. Persistent (more than 0.5 h) stresses at supracellular scales, rather than cell-scale stresses, guide morphogenetic flows in fluid-like tissue regions. Unidirectional axis extension is sustained by the reported rigidification of the presomitic mesoderm, which mechanically supports posterior, fluid-like tissues during remodelling before their maturation. The spatiotemporal control of fluid-like and solid-like tissue states may represent a generic physical mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis.</p>

<li>Explaining the genetics of many diseases is challenging because most associations localize to incompletely characterized regulatory regions. Using new computational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy multiple loci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein–Barr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene–environment interaction. Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins.</li>

<li>One of the characteristics of the CNS is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the CNS undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment1–3, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the CNS remain poorly understood4–6. In searching for T cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the CSF, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the CNS. The discovery of the CNS lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and shed new light on the etiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.</li>

<li>Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by invasion of the brain by autoreactive T cells. The mechanism for how T cells acquire their encephalitogenic phenotype and trigger disease remains, however, unclear. The existence of lymphatic vessels in the meninges indicates a relevant link between the CNS and peripheral immune system, perhaps affecting autoimmunity. Here we demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics fulfill two critical criteria: they assist in the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid components and enable immune cells to enter draining lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner. Unlike other tissues, meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells do not undergo expansion during inflammation, and they express a unique transcriptional signature. Notably, the ablation of meningeal lymphatics diminishes pathology and reduces the inflammatory response of brain-reactive T cells during an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the CNS and pose a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.</li>

<li>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) provides real-time histologic imaging of human tissues at a depth of 60–70 μm during endoscopy. pCLE of the extrahepatic bile duct after fluorescein injection demonstrated a reticular pattern within fluorescein-filled sinuses that had no known anatomical correlate. Freezing biopsy tissue before fixation preserved the anatomy of this structure, demonstrating that it is part of the submucosa and a previously unappreciated fluid-filled interstitial space, draining to lymph nodes and supported by a complex network of thick collagen bundles. These bundles are intermittently lined on one side by fibroblast-like cells that stain with endothelial markers and vimentin, although there is a highly unusual and extensive unlined interface between the matrix proteins of the bundles and the surrounding fluid. We observed similar structures in numerous tissues that are subject to intermittent or rhythmic compression, including the submucosae of the entire gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder, the dermis, the peri-bronchial and peri-arterial soft tissues, and fascia. These anatomic structures may be important in cancer metastasis, edema, fibrosis, and mechanical functioning of many or all tissues and organs. In sum, we describe the anatomy and histology of a previously unrecognized, though widespread, macroscopic, fluid-filled space within and between tissues, a novel expansion and specification of the concept of the human interstitium.</li>

<li>We describe convergent evidence from transcriptomics, morphology, and physiology for a specialized GABAergic neuron subtype in human cortex. Using unbiased single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we identify ten GABAergic interneuron subtypes with combinatorial gene signatures in human cortical layer 1 and characterize a group of human interneurons with anatomical features never described in rodents, having large ‘rosehip’-like axonal boutons and compact arborization. These rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (GAD1+CCK+, CNR1–SST–CALB2–PVALB–) matching a single transcriptomically defined cell type whose specific molecular marker signature is not seen in mouse cortex. Rosehip cells in layer 1 make homotypic gap junctions, predominantly target apical dendritic shafts of layer 3 pyramidal neurons, and inhibit backpropagating pyramidal action potentials in microdomains of the dendritic tuft. These cells are therefore positioned for potent local control of distal dendritic computation in cortical pyramidal neurons.</li>

<p><em>new types of experiments reveal that a neuron functions as multiple independent threshold units</em><br />

<li>Neurons are the computational elements that compose the brain and their fundamental principles of activity are known for decades. According to the long-lasting computational scheme, each neuron sums the incoming electrical signals via its dendrites and when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold the neuron typically generates a spike to its axon. Here we present three types of experiments, using neuronal cultures, indicating that each neuron functions as a collection of independent threshold units. The neuron is anisotropically activated following the origin of the arriving signals to the membrane, via its dendritic trees. The first type of experiments demonstrates that a single neuron’s spike waveform typically varies as a function of the stimulation location. The second type reveals that spatial summation is absent for extracellular stimulations from different directions. The third type indicates that spatial summation and subtraction are not achieved when combining intra- and extra- cellular stimulations, as well as for nonlocal time interference, where the precise timings of the stimulations are irrelevant. Results call to re-examine neuronal functionalities beyond the traditional framework, and the advanced computational capabilities and dynamical properties of such complex systems.</li>

<li>Enhancers function as DNA logic gates and may control specialized functions of billions of neurons. Here we show a tailored program of noncoding genome elements active in situ in physiologically distinct dopamine neurons of the human brain. We found 71,022 transcribed noncoding elements, many of which were consistent with active enhancers and with regulatory mechanisms in zebrafish and mouse brains. Genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease were enriched in these elements. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that Parkinson’s disease-associated variants on chromosome 17q21 cis-regulate the expression of an enhancer RNA in dopamine neurons. This study shows that enhancers in dopamine neurons link genetic variation to neuropsychiatric traits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Systems-level organization in spontaneous infra-slow (&lt;0.1Hz) brain activity, measured using blood oxygen signals in fMRI and optical imaging, has become a major theme in the study of neural function in both humans and animal models. Yet the neurophysiological basis of infra-slow activity (ISA) remains unresolved. In particular, is ISA a distinct physiological process, or is it a low-frequency analog of faster neural activity? Here, using whole-cortex calcium/hemoglobin imaging in mice, we show that ISA in each of these modalities travels through the cortex along stereotypical spatiotemporal trajectories that are state dependent (wake versus anesthesia) and distinct from trajectories in delta (1–4 Hz) activity. Moreover, mouse laminar electrophysiology reveals that ISA travels through specific cortical layers and is organized into unique cross-laminar temporal dynamics that are different from higher frequency local field potential activity. These findings suggest that ISA is a distinct neurophysiological process that is reflected in fMRI blood oxygen signals.</li>

Disrupted cilia signaling may underlie circuit malformations in ciliopathies</p>
<p>Appropriate growth and synaptic integration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are essential for functional neural circuits in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of primary cilia function following the selective loss of ciliary GTPase Arl13b in interneurons impairs interneuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity, leading to altered excitatory/inhibitory activity balance. The altered morphology and connectivity of cilia mutant interneurons and the functional deficits are rescued by either chemogenetic activation of ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling or the selective induction of Sstr3, a ciliary GPCR, in Arl13b-deficient cilia. Our results thus define a specific requirement for primary cilia-mediated GPCR signaling in interneuronal connectivity and inhibitory circuit formation.</p>

<li>Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural computation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which generate dendritic action potentials (DAP) and profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and suprathreshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicting hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Human genome function is underpinned by the primary storage of genetic information in canonical B-form DNA, with a second layer of DNA structure providing regulatory control. I-motif structures are thought to form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive. Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab) that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome.</li>

<p><em>material-independent mechanochemical effect in the deformation of highly-strain-hardening metals</em><br />
anirudh udupa et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.10.014009">http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.10.014009</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Soft and highly-strain-hardening metals such as iron, aluminum, and tantalum, often called “gummy,” are notoriously difficult to cut. This is due to their tendency to exhibit redundant, unsteady plastic flow with large-amplitude folding, which results also in macroscale defects on the cut surface and large energy dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that this difficulty can be overcome by merely coating the initial metal surface with common adhesive chemical media such as glues and inks. Using high-speed <em>in situ</em> imaging, we show that the media act by coupling unsteady surface-plastic-flow modes with interface energetics—a mechanochemical action—thereby effecting a ductile-to-brittle transition, locally. Consequently, the unsteady plastic flow with folding transitions to a periodic segmentation-type flow in the presence of the surface media, with near absence of defects on the cut surface and significantly lower energy dissipation (a reduction of up to 80%). This mechanochemical effect is controllable and not material specific, with the chemical media demonstrating comparable efficacy across different metal systems. This makes it quite distinct from other well-known mechanochemical effects, such as liquid-metal embrittlement and stress-corrosion cracking, that are both highly material specific and catastrophic. An analytic model incorporating local flow dynamics, stability of dislocation emission, and surface-media energetics is found to correctly predict the onset of the plastic-flow transition. The benign nature and simplicity of the media suggest wide-ranging opportunities for improving the performance of cutting and deformation processes for metals and alloys in practical settings.</li>

We think the brain is controlling the regeneration of all these tissues through the ANS. But that brings up a bigger picture. For individuals under severe depression or PTSD, for example, you see degeneration of some of their organs. It could be some sort of stress-related effect through the ANS decreasing the regenerative potential of the organs. Based on our findings, it looks like there could be a direct effect.”</p>

<p><em>oviposition strategies of florida culex (melanoconion) mosquitoes</em><br />

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx052">https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx052</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In the genus Culex, oviposition is often generalized as laying floating egg rafts directly on the surface of the water, as reported for arbovirus vectors Culex pipiens L. and Culex tarsalis Coquillett, both members of subgenus Culex. The current work reports on investigations of exceptions to this strategy by species of Melanoconion, a diverse and mostly tropical subgenus of Culex, with many arbovirus vectors. Wild gravid females from Vero Beach, FL, were introduced into outdoor cages with open water, partially covered water, and emergent solid structures for oviposition. Three species, Culex cedecei Stone and Hair, Culex iolambdis Dyar, and Culex pilosus Dyar and Knab laid vast majorities (80–100%) of egg clusters attached to solid surfaces, although at different heights and angles, while Culex atratus Theobald laid floating egg clusters (100%) directly on the water. When offered mud, open water, and woody material, Cx. iolambdis laid 86% of clusters on nearly vertical surfaces of mangrove rootlets. Culex iolambdis eggs laid on solid surfaces hatched within 3–4 d or dried up without hatching. Results suggest that Melanoconion species utilize a variety of oviposition strategies, yet most species studied oviposit out of water. For some species, such as Cx. pilosus, this is a strategy for diapause and desiccation resistance, while for others, such as Cx. iolambdis, ovipositing above water may protect eggs from predators or being flushed from larval habitat. A summary of oviposition strategies in genus Culex shows that above-water oviposition is widespread and that the Culex egg raft paradigm needs reassessment.</li>

<p><em>a new statistical method to test equivalence: an application in male and female eastern bluebird song</em><br />
evangeline m. rose et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.09.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.09.004</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awareness of female birdsong is growing worldwide, thanks in part to a breakthrough paper by Karan Odom, Ph.D. ‘16, biological sciences, but it’s still understood as a trait found primarily in tropical birds. Evangeline Rose, a current Ph.D. student in the same lab and first author on a new paper in <em>Animal Behavior</em>, wanted to look at song in a temperate species.<br />
During Rose’s fieldwork, “I was finding that the females were singing, to me, what sounded just like male songs,” she says. “So we started thinking about equality, and equivalence, and how to test for it.” On the advice of her advisor, Kevin Omland, professor of biological sciences, she reached out to Thomas Mathew, professor of statistics, who has expertise in statistical equivalence.<br />
<strong>Challenging a paradigm</strong><br />
Working together, the team modified a statistical method used in generic drug testing to meet their needs for ecology and animal behavior studies. The existing test helps determine whether generic and brand name drugs are “statistically equivalent,” meaning they are similar enough to be prescribed safely for the same purpose. The new modification will allow scientists in other fields to test for equivalence. Before, researchers could only report they did not find a significant difference — a very different statement than saying two things are conclusively equivalent.<br />
“We’re really hoping this new method is going to address some issues with what kinds of data get published,” Rose says. “The most important thing about being a good scientist is to be unbiased. And the whole tradition of testing for difference really leads to incredible biases in scientists,” Omland says. He adds, “There’s a whole realm of things in nature that we find interesting and important because of their similarity.”<br />
For example, in addition to similarities in songs between the sexes in birds, researchers could use the new test to ask if two species use the same type of habitat, respond the same way to predators, or consume the same food sources. Answers to those questions could fill long-standing knowledge gaps, or even inform conservation efforts.<br />
“This test is really broadly applicable,” says Rose, “and we’re hoping to introduce it more to the ecology and evolution field.”<br />
<strong>A new approach</strong><br />
One advantage of the new method is it accounts for unequal sample sizes. In a medical study, researchers can carefully control the size of treatment and control groups. In other fields, from ecology, to engineering, to agriculture, that’s often not possible. The new test also allows researchers to determine the equivalence of several traits simultaneously, Mathew explains. For example, in this study, the authors found that the male and female birds’ songs were statistically equivalent across five different characteristics, such as duration of each song and the range of pitches the birds produced.<br />
Rather than testing whether two things are exactly equal, the team was looking for a way to determine if two things were “close enough,” given a defined allowable margin of difference. Because of that added layer, “There are additional challenges here,” Mathew says.<br />
“Even though this methodology is out there, it hasn’t been applied — even in statistics — with this kind of data. That’s why I was very excited when they brought this project to me,” Mathew says. Rose adds, “It ended up being a really great partnership to look at these questions that hadn’t been asked before for female song, and we also ended up modifying this test in a really cool, new way.”<br />
<strong>Changing science</strong><br />
As research on similarities grows, there is also a growing drive to remove the bias against publishing studies that do not find a significant difference, often termed a “negative result.” This paper “is part of an amazing drumbeat that’s building up in the scientific community,” Omland says. “There’s a broader problem with the scientific method that’s being increasingly acknowledged, and the test we’ve developed can at least play a small role, and I hope a big role, in addressing it.”<br />
Rose, who plans to next investigate the function of female bluebird songs, says she will carry these new techniques with her as she moves through her research career. “I think in the future, I’ll be thinking about how equivalence can change the questions we’re asking, and I’ll always keep in mind that we have extra tools in the toolkit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>•Although understudied, recent studies suggest that female birdsong is widespread.<br />
•We compared male and female song using a novel statistical equivalence test.<br />
•Both sexes had statistically equivalent songs based on five acoustic measures.<br />
•Our equivalence test will have wide applicability in behaviour, ecology and evolution.</p>
<p>Understanding complex natural systems requires approaches with minimal statistical limitations and biases. Previously, however, the fields of behaviour, ecology and evolution generally have been restricted to evaluating differences between statistical distributions. This framework can be very powerful. Unfortunately, it has also created a bias in these, and many other, fields towards publications focusing only on phenomena for which there are statistically significant differences. However, there is a wide range of questions that would benefit from reversing the existing paradigm and testing, instead, for equivalence. We have adapted the two one-sided test (TOST), also known as equivalence testing, from pharmaceutical science to be applicable to behavioural and ecological studies. We created a repeated measures analysis that allows researchers to statistically examine similarities between distributions. We compared song structure in male and female eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, as a case study for this method. We failed to find significant differences between male and female songs via a more traditional test, repeated measures ANOVA. Therefore, no definitive conclusion could be drawn about the similarities or differences in song structure. However, our repeated measures equivalence test showed that, based on five standard measures of song variation, male and female eastern bluebirds sing statistically equivalent songs. Our study highlights the presence of complex female song in a temperate songbird species. Additionally, we provide a new statistical test useful for expanding the statistical toolbox to assess new behavioural and ecological questions, and to help counteract publication bias in our fields.</p>

•Cerebellar BOLD signals temporally lag the cortex by hundreds of milliseconds</p>
<p>The cerebellum contains the majority of neurons in the human brain and is unique for its uniform cytoarchitecture, absence of aerobic glycolysis, and role in adaptive plasticity. Despite anatomical and physiological differences between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, group-average functional connectivity studies have identified networks related to specific functions in both structures. Recently, precision functional mapping of individuals revealed that functional networks in the cerebral cortex exhibit measurable individual specificity. Using the highly sampled Midnight Scan Club (MSC) dataset, we found the cerebellum contains reliable, individual-specific network organization that is significantly more variable than the cerebral cortex. The frontoparietal network, thought to support adaptive control, was the only network overrepresented in the cerebellum compared to the cerebral cortex (2.3-fold). Temporally, all cerebellar resting state signals lagged behind the cerebral cortex (125–380 ms), supporting the hypothesis that the cerebellum engages in a domain-general function in the adaptive control of all cortical processes.</p>

<p>Higher levels of alpha brainwaves enable people to come up with ideas which are further away from the obvious or well-known uses.</p>
<p>The researchers show that stimulating the right temporal part of the brain in the alpha frequency increases the capability of inhibiting obvious links in both types of creative thinking.</p>
<p>This was demonstrated by applying an electrical current to the brain through a non-invasive technique called transcranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS) which causes minimal to no side effects or sensations.</p>
<p>The findings have implications for how we understand creativity and opens up potential ways of affecting the creative process including by using tACS.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Caroline Di Bernardi Luft, from Queen Mary University of London, said: &quot;If we need to generate alternative uses of a glass, first we must inhibit our past experience which leads us to think of a glass as a container. Our study's novelty is to demonstrate that right temporal alpha oscillations is a key neural mechanism for overriding these obvious associations.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to understand the processes underlying the production of novel and adequate ideas, we need to break down its constituent processes, dissecting creativity as much as possible at first, and then analysing them in context, before putting them back together to understand the process as a whole.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers demonstrated the neural mechanism responsible for creativity by monitoring the brain's electrical activity through an electroencephalogram (EEG) which picks up electrical signals through small sensors placed on the head. Using tACS also enabled them to probe the waves' causal role.</p>
<p>The experiments they conducted looked at how the brain tackles a series of creative tasks such as finding words that link to one another. For example, every time we search for concepts associated with a word we start from stronger associations to move progressively towards weaker or more remote ones (e.g. cat &gt; dog &gt; animal &gt; pet &gt; human &gt; people &gt; family).</p>
<p>Previous studies show that some people are more creative than others because they are able to avoid strong associations in order to reach more remote ones and this study demonstrates that the alpha brainwaves are crucially involved in this process.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths, University of London's Professor Joydeep Bhattacharya, a co-author of this study, added: &quot;Two roads diverged in a wood, I took the one less travelled by. And that has made all the difference,' wrote Robert Frost in his famous poem.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Taking a less travelled route is needed for thinking creatively, and our findings provide some evidence on how this is done in our brain.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> “Taking a less-traveled path” is often considered an effective approach to creativity (i.e., creative thinking calls for a break from habitual thinking and associations), yet little is known about its underlying neural mechanism. In a series of four independent experiments involving electrophysiological and brain stimulation methods we provide evidence that this process is mediated by the right temporal alpha oscillations. Alpha oscillations are known to represent a process of active inhibition to suppress irrelevant information, such as inhibiting distractions during visual search. Through monitoring the brain’s electrical activity during different creativity tasks and by stimulating the right temporal brain region at the alpha frequency we show that a similar process of active inhibition is also key to creative thinking.</p>

<li>methods and institutions that appear “currently successful” may have little incentive towards change or improvement. even if some people want to change or improve, those that do not want to change use the “success” to argue against change. this is one of the reasons why for us to change, we need to understand that “success” is not what it seems to be. if it seems to be a destination then actually it has become a trap. this is why trying to understand “virtue”, how to live a virtuous life, and trying to do so even while not really understanding it, is one of the most important parts of living — if we do not try for this, then we will lose our way and become poisonous and abusive, even if we do not mean to be so.</li>

<li>we assume our assumptions often without questioning them. why should being adrift in the world be better or worse than anchoring to someone or a place? should we try to keep our friends if we truly love them, should we bind them to us? how do we tell what is right, or even that thinking that something is right is somehow a value that we should cherish? or that if we believe in a story, an explanation, an understanding of something, that this is better than something else? just because we may never really understand or value something or somebody, does not mean we cannot cherish them.</li>

<li>because most people’s beliefs do not often change, they assume that yours do not.</li>
<li>then it becomes a problem if they think you believe certain things because they will judge you for them.</li>
<li>instead of beliefs being tools, they assume your current beliefs are part of your “identity”.</li>
<li>because we understand there is no “right” or “wrong”, no “bad” or “good”, only that–which–is–possibly–temporarily–slightly–more–appropriate–to–reality (or possibly–less), we are not so bound to what is, now, or what we think is, now.</li>
<li>although this is important, i will not repeat this in front of every belief, that is, i will not preface each belief with “we know this is not right–or–wrong, good–or–bad, only possibly–slightly–less or possibly–slightly–more”. everything we think of has context, and this is part of the context we know. so when we think about something, it is usually not to judge it and find it wanting but to try to understand where such a thought might lead people if they become bound by it, because we want to learn how to deal with the consequences of that.</li>

<li>have you ever wondered why we are different, even though society pressures us to be the same? have you ever wondered why people feel the need to judge others, when, if we think about it a little, there is no real basis for judging? where do these values, these beliefs that we are right and good come from, and how real are they?</li>
<li>how important is it that we do this, that we question our beliefs? well, without it, our truths become lies, our religions become idolatories, our civilisations become corrupt and die. but, in reality, a sense of importance is another illusion of value — so what can we base our lives upon, if even basing our lives upon something is an illusion?</li>
