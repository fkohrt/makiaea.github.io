<p>KUB:  Things we know, believe, and understand. The most secure of truths.</p>
<p>KB:  Things we know and believe, but do not understand. This includes scientific facts that are certainly true, even if we don't understand them. For example, I don't really understand how gravity works, but I know and believe it works. I know and believe that the earth is round, but I don't understand why.</p>
<p>B:  Things we believe, but do not understand or know. These are our axioms, where everything else begins—the things we can't justify using anything else. For example, for me, there are things like love and the preciousness of life. I believe that love is the most important thing of all. I can't explain why, and I can't say I know for sure it is true—because what does that even mean?</p>
<p>After this things get a bit trickier.</p>
<p>K:</p>
<p>Things we know, but do not understand or believe. Is this at all possible? I think if you've ever experienced sudden grief or heartbreak you might have a sense of what this is like. Those numb days after the event when you know, rationally, that it really has happened, but you simply can't believe it, you can't feel it to be true in your stomach. And you certainly don't understand it. Perhaps extremes of good emotions feel like this too. Perhaps if I won the lottery I would, for a while, know that it had happened without understanding or believing it. Winning the lottery of love feels like that too, at least at the height of its ecstasy.</p>
<p>KU:  Things we know and understand, but do not believe. Perhaps this is where we get to the next stage of grieving, when we have come to understand that this terrible thing really has happened, but we still don't believe it. But if you're in this state you're probably in some state of denial, because usually knowing and understanding something would make you really believe it's true.</p>
<p>Finally we have the following sections, which I suspect are empty.</p>

<p><em>positive attitude toward math supports early academic success: behavioral evidence and neurocognitive mechanisms</em><br />
lang chen et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617735528">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617735528</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive attitude is thought to impact academic achievement and learning in children, but little is known about its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Using a large behavioral sample of 240 children, we found that positive attitude toward math uniquely predicted math achievement, even after we accounted for multiple other cognitive-affective factors. We then investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the link between positive attitude and academic achievement in two independent cohorts of children (discovery cohort: <em>n</em> = 47; replication cohort: <em>n</em> = 28) and tested competing hypotheses regarding the differential roles of affective-motivational and learning-memory systems. In both cohorts, we found that positive attitude was associated with increased engagement of the hippocampal learning-memory system. Structural equation modeling further revealed that, in both cohorts, increased hippocampal activity and more frequent use of efficient memory-based strategies mediated the relation between positive attitude and higher math achievement. Our study is the first to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms by which positive attitude influences learning and academic achievement.</li>

<li>In this review, we are pitting two theories against each other: the more accepted theory—the ‘number sense’ theory—suggesting that a sense of number is innate and non-symbolic numerosity is being processed independently of continuous magnitudes (e.g., size, area, density); and the newly emerging theory suggesting that (1) both numerosities and continuous magnitudes are processed holistically when comparing numerosities, and (2) a sense of number might not be innate. In the first part of this review, we discuss the ‘number sense’ theory. Against this background, we demonstrate how the natural correlation between numerosities and continuous magnitudes makes it nearly impossible to study non-symbolic numerosity processing in isolation from continuous magnitudes, and therefore the results of behavioral and imaging studies with infants, adults and animals can be explained, at least in part, by relying on continuous magnitudes. In the second part, we explain the ‘sense of magnitude’ theory and review studies that directly demonstrate that continuous magnitudes are more automatic and basic than numerosities. Finally, we present outstanding questions. Our conclusion is that there is not enough convincing evidence to support the number sense theory anymore. Therefore, we encourage researchers not to assume that number sense is simply innate, but to put this hypothesis to the test, and to consider if such an assumption is even testable in light of the correlation of numerosity and continuous magnitudes.</li>

<li>Likelihood estimations are crucial for dealing with the uncertainty of life. Here, infants’ sensitivity to the difference in likelihood between two events was investigated. Infants aged 6, 12, and 18 months (<em>N</em> = 75) were shown animated movies of a machine simultaneously drawing likely and unlikely samples from a box filled with different colored balls. In different trials, the difference in likelihood between the two samples was manipulated. The infants’ looking patterns varied as a function of the magnitude of the difference in likelihood and were modulated by the number of items in the samples. Looking patterns showed qualitative similarities across age groups. This study demonstrates that infants’ looking responses are sensitive to the magnitude of the difference in likelihood between two events.</li>

swimming speed is “proportional to the the length of the body in water”. but is this is really the case? actually how it should be said is “all other things being equal, etc.” the length of the body in water is an explanation for speed, not the cause of it. the cause is reducing resistance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Farming makes much use of what military sorts call ‘field expediency’, the process of making do when you work in conditions that deny you the predictable or standard supplies. My farm is cluttered by products of my grandfather’s genius in field expediency. He built our table saw out of a washtub, salvaged barn oak, a mower engine, and a truck leaf spring. Most things on the farm are made of other, unpredictable things – calf-bottle nipples as tool grips, sheared-off coffee cans as feed scoops, chisel plow blades welded into a child’s sled. Until recently, the farmhouse sported windows retrieved from the wreck of an old hotel, and the insulation was comprised of old clothes. This, then, is field expediency at work. But to make it work, you have to not throw things away.</li>
<li>When I took over the farm following my grandfather’s death, I initially despaired at all the loose bits and pieces that littered the place. Wire was my special enemy, for the barns were everywhere cluttered with it – wire salvaged from telephones, from appliances, from who-could-tell-where. I accumulated buckets of wire with a plan to dispose of them. Mercifully, I never got round to it, for I quickly learned the uncommon worth of wire. For example, it presently holds the muffler to my truck, secures the busted PTO cover on my bushhog, and seams caging around fruit-tree saplings, the better to protect them from the depredations of deer. My only concern about wire now is that I might need more.</li>
<li>The stock images sometimes used to depict the pitiable conditions or pathologies of the rural poor – images of homeplaces surrounded by wreckage and ‘trash’ – tell a bigger story if you know how to read them. The broken-down car in the yard contains parts that still have use in them if need arises. That rusty freezer on the porch probably contains the dog’s food, since nothing beats an old freezer for storing feed where unsanctioned animals can’t get at it. Put plainly, if there is wire everywhere, there’s probably a reason. And if you can’t see the reason, there’s probably a reason for that too.</li>

<p>“You toss it once, and it comes up heads. It’s possible to prove that the probability of a head on the second toss is two out of three using Bayesian probability. However, the initial probability of a head was one out of two, and we didn’t change the coin. The Bayesian viewpoint says that while the first head will not directly affect the probability of the second head, it gives you more information about the coin that allows you to refine your estimate. A coin heavily biased toward tails is highly unlikely to flip heads, and a coin heavily biased toward heads is much more likely to flip heads.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Taking a Bayesian approach also helps avoid a type of paradox first pointed out by German logician Carl Hempel in the 1940s. When people see the same principle, such as the law of gravity, operating without fail over a long period of time, they naturally assume that it’s true with a very high probability. This is inductive reasoning, which can be summed up as follows: if things are observed that are consistent with a theory, then the probability that the theory is true increases. Hempel, however, pointed out a snag with induction, using ravens as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All ravens are black, so the theory goes. Every time a raven is seen to be black and no other color—ignoring the fact that there are albino ravens!—our confidence in the theory “All ravens are black” is boosted. Here, though, is the rub. The statement “All ravens are black” is logically equivalent to the statement “All nonblack things are nonravens.” So, if we see a yellow banana, which is a nonblack thing and also a nonraven, it should bolster our belief that all “ravens are black. To get around this highly counterintuitive result, some philosophers have argued that we shouldn’t treat the two sides of the argument as having the same strength. In other words, yellow bananas should make us believe more in the theory that all nonblack things are nonravens (first statement), without influencing the belief that all ravens are black (second statement). This seems to fit with common sense—a banana is a nonraven, so observing one can tell us about nonravens but tells nothing about ravens. But it’s a suggestion that’s been criticized on the basis that you can’t have a different degree of belief in two statements that are logically equivalent, if it’s clear that either both are true or both are false. Maybe our intuition in this matter is at fault, and seeing another yellow banana really should increase the probability that all ravens are black. Adopting a Bayesian stance, however, the paradox never arises. According to Bayes, the probability of a hypothesis H must be multiplied by this ratio:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probability of observing X if H is true /<br />
Probability of observing X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where X is a nonblack object that’s a nonraven and H is the hypothesis that all ravens are black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you ask someone to select a banana at random and show it to you, then the probability of seeing a yellow banana doesn’t depend on the colors of ravens. You already know beforehand that you’ll see a nonraven. The numerator (the number on top) will equal the denominator (the number on the bottom), the ratio will equal one, and the probability will remain unchanged. Seeing a yellow banana won’t affect your belief about whether all ravens are black. If you ask someone to select a nonblack thing at random and they show you a yellow banana, then the numerator will be bigger than the denominator by a tiny amount. Seeing the yellow banana will only slightly increase your belief that all ravens are black. You would have to see almost every nonblack thing in the universe and see that they were all nonravens before your belief in “All ravens are black” went up significantly. In both cases, the result agrees with intuition.”</p>

<p>“In 1931, several years before leaving Austria and joining the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, where he became a close friend of Albert Einstein, Gödel published two extraordinary and shocking theorems—his first and second incompleteness theorems. In a nutshell, the first of these theorems showed that any system of mathematics that is complex enough to include ordinary arithmetic—the kind we learn in school—can never be both complete and consistent. If a system is complete, it means that everything within it can be either proved or disproved. If it’s consistent, it means that no statement can be both proved and disproved. Like a bolt out of the blue, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems revealed that, in any mathematical system (apart from the very simplest), there will always be things that are true but that can’t be proved to be true. The incompleteness theorems are analogous in some ways to the uncertainty principle in physics in that they expose fundamental limits to what can be known. And like the uncertainty principle, they’re frustrating and inhibiting because they show that reality—including purely intellectual reality—behaves in ways that prevent us from being omniscient about everything that we try to penetrate with our minds. To put it bluntly, truth is a more powerful concept than proof, which, for a mathematician especially, is anathema.”</p>

<p><em>emissions of tetrachlorobiphenyls (pcbs 47, 51, and 68) from polymer resin on kitchen cabinets as a non-aroclor source to residential air</em><br />

<li>Both Aroclor and non-Aroclor sources of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in residential homes. We deployed passive air samplers at 16 residences and found PCB-47, PCB-51, and PCB-68 to account for up to 50% of measured indoor ΣPCBs (2700 pg m–3). Although PCB-47 and PCB-51 are neurotoxins present in Aroclor mixtures (&lt;2.5 and &lt;0.3 wt %, respectively), we found them at much higher levels than expected for any Aroclor source. PCB-68 is not present in Aroclor mixtures. Another non-Aroclor congener, PCB-11, a byproduct of pigment manufacturing, was found inside and outside of every household and was frequently the predominate congener. We conducted direct measurements of surface emissions and identified finished cabinetry to be a major source of PCB-47, PCB-51, and PCB-68. We hypothesize that these congeners are inadvertent byproducts of polymer sealant manufacturing and produced from the decomposition of 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide used as an initiator in free-radical polymerization of polyester resins. The presence of these three compounds in polymer products, such as silicone, has been widely noted, but to our knowledge they have never been shown to be a significant environmental source of PCBs.</li>

<li>clearing silicone sealant from sealant applicator (conical) nozzle

<li>we are using a nozzle that is attached to the sealant tube using plastic screw–thread</li>
<li>the screw–thread is a weak–point and allows the nozzle to be detached easily from the sealant tube body</li>
<li>after using the sealant, cap the nozzle end using cling film and rubber band. this does not prevent air ingress, but will keep the sealant in the nozzle usable for a few days. beyond that, air enters and sets the sealant in the conical nozzle</li>
<li>the set sealant in the nozzle can be removed easily by unscrewing the nozzle, and then using a medium–sized drill bit (attached to a hand–drill) to drill around the inner sides of the nozzle (from the now open larger end of the cone). the silicone sealant stays largely together, and if you drill carefully, the sides of the nozzle cone will be undamaged. the sealant stays together while being displaced by the drilling, and once it has worked loose from most of the nozzle cone, you will be able to pull the entire conical plug out in almost one piece.</li>
<li>finally use a small drill to open a hole into the main sealant tube body, this should hopefully not be difficult or deep as the sealant plug hopefull will have kept air from the main body of the tube. reattach the now–empty nozzle to the main tube body, and use the sealant tube as normal.</li>

<li>anger at abuse can be used effectively to bypass internal obstacles. it is a useful motivator to action.
<ul>
<li>the body is not suited to abuse and over–specialisation. it is much easier for it to repair itself when it is not exposed overmuch to extremes. this is not to say exposure to some extremes such as anger and excitement are unnecessary. but in most situations it is good to be moderate.</li>

<li>mixing and composites
<ul>
<li>idea of mixing is to use strengths of things or people where they are most appropriate</li>
<li>if you deny mixing, you deny a fundamental property of the universe</li>
<li>it's like a house with no windows</li>

</ul>
<h2>00542</h2>
<ul>
<li>The test where to check the pattern you need to find the card that refutes the theory, not confirms it. popular conception of scientific method is wrong, not searching for confirmation — rather, for verification. we need to look for that single disproof, when it is a true disproof, we can move on to another issue. that is how we can be truly effective in our learning and doing, though almost nobody yet understands this.
<ul>
<li>there may be no way to prove a theory, for theories are not truths. they are guesses, and one of the most effective ways to move forward from a mistaken theory is to find evidence which refutes it. this is what works if you are not emotionally dependent on the theory you are testing, this does not work well if you are reliant on that theory to provide something otherwise missing from your life</li>
<li>change conditions of game test to ones where we are detecting abuse — are the test’s aims and our ability to solve them clearer?</li>

<h2>when tipping something granular (loose and not sticky or liquid) from a container — to do this in a controlled fashion, put the edge of the container near where you want the something to end up, and the side of the container is just off horizontal so that you need to push the something up the side of the container before it will spill out. this way you will have better control of the emerging contents than if the contents slide out by themselves under gravity (if the slope of the side of the container was in the other direction)</h2>

<ul>
<li>if you need to remember multiple steps but are having difficulty, for example due to sleep deprivation or memory loss or have many different things to do at once or need to share the steps between people or are learning or teaching steps or starting new habits, then use tokens to represent the steps and remove or flip them as a person completes each step. robust and easy physical tokens include four–sided sticks (label the sides you need), labeled dials for many multiple steps, coins etc. you can also use non–visual methods such as textures or braille or lego or pegs in holes, or technology–aided methods for repeat–use like checklists, timed routines, or the ithoughts checking gesture (to clear multiple checks, use the clear all button PC the info progress menu after selecting all the checks you want to clear). lego technic with pegs and labels is cheap, portable and easily repurposed. knots on a string is a more permanent record.</li>

<li>empty mind of periodic recalling of tasks that need to be done; write the tasks into a mindmap that you can reorganise and update. this allows more flow in day-to-day life while helping keep track of tasks we need to do</li>

<ul>
<li>what is effectiveness?
<ul>
<li>unfortunately most people don’t want to learn most of the time. this is not because they are evil, but because this is what people showed them as they grew up. thus we have what seems like a chicken and egg problem. but this is not the case. most people care most of the time, but many just don’t know how to care effectively.</li>
<li>instead of being a monolithic agent which must move only in one direction, we are a myriad with diverse skills that can move in harmony — this may be the essence of how we are different from the abusers.</li>
<li>stitch in time saves nine: about understanding what to do that will help to solve something so that it doesn't need to be resolved over and over again</li>
<li>making rules that do not need “do this but”</li>
<li>simple rule for change
<ul>
<li>let them know you hear what they say</li>
<li>tell them what you intend to do, even if it's not what they want to hear</li>
<li>repeat, and do the action you intended while repeating</li>
