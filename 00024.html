<p><em>intolerance of uncertainty predicts increased striatal volume</em><br />
m. justin kim et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000331">dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000331</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Oversensitivity to uncertain future threat is usefully conceptualized as intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Neuroimaging studies of IU to date have largely focused on its relationship with brain function, but few studies have documented the association between IU and the quantitative properties of brain structure. Here, we examined potential gray and white-matter brain structural correlates of IU from 61 healthy participants. Voxel-based morphometric analysis highlighted a robust positive correlation between IU and striatal volume, particularly the putamen. Conversely, tract-based spatial statistical analysis showed no evidence for a relationship between IU and the structural integrity of white-matter fiber tracts. Current results converge upon findings from individuals with anxiety disorders such as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), where abnormally increased IU and striatal volume are consistently reported. They also converge with neurobehavioral data implicating the putamen in predictive coding. Most notably, the relationship between IU and striatal volume is observed at a preclinical level, suggesting that the volumetric properties of the striatum reflect the processing of uncertainty per se as it relates to this dimensional personality characteristic. Such a relationship could then potentially contribute to the onset of OCD or GAD, rather than being unique to their pathophysiology.</li>

<ul>
<li>change
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is not that we will be stuck in one state forever or that we would be stuck in constant change. we will always face challenges and so we will always be stuck in something — we seek to change what we are stuck with so that we deal with different things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the first question I should ask my friend is, “what is your understanding of change?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it might seem as if there are two competing forces, one of constancy and one of change, but in reality they are one and the same, have been so, and always will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neuroplasticity, epigenetics, evolution, are showing the way that change is emerging in people's consciousness of biology. as for philosophy, the idea of change is crucial to the concept of choice. when we can choose in a meaningful way, then only does morality really exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we develop by replacing what no longer works with what does now work and what will work in the future. yet most of the time, what we see seems unchanging — what works, and doesn't, seems to rule the world. this is not a paradox. there is no reason to change until it is necessary, and also at the same time we must prepare the way for change as comes — and it will come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yet often things do seem the same on the surface, even as it changes — our bodies, society, and the earth herself.</p>
<ul>
<li>it might seem that things stay the same, but even memories, like all spells, change all the time, sometimes ever so slightly, sometimes in leaps and bounds.</li>
<li>this movement, this flow of all things, is living, breathing, pulsing.</li>
<li>the flow of life, too, though it may seem to move in one direction, actually moves in many ways. what may seem to be against the flow on one day, may be but a portend of what is to be the next.</li>
<li>some might seem like sticks in the mud, stuck against the flow until they are washed away — by the wash of a wave, by the tumult of a tide, by the sweep of a storm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>change in ancient times can be studied through what has endured from those times — their changing ideas. (read sophus’ book, also the role of the gods in ancient greece)</p>
<ul>
<li>history, like memory, is created anew as we seek it. so the wisdom of the ancients is really a layered crystal of all who bore the idea before us, changed and metamorphosed in so many different ways.</li>
<li>xenophanes “clouds” as story ironical introduction to ancient philosophers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>what we now lack most is no longer data or access to data, but our ability to change</p>
<ul>
<li>this is what is common between why abusers continue to do what they do, why many people fail to deal with collective, societal and even personal issues</li>
<li>with proper method, this lack in our ability of change, like the lack of information, can be readily overcome. of course the problem then is the proper method — understanding, changing and acting upon it.</li>
<li>many people end up believing that the ability of humans to change is small — and this is precisely how oppressors and abusers wish us to think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>mavericks are essential because by living outside, in some way, of the past prevailing current, they show the way of the current as it is now and as it will be</p>
<ul>
<li>thus for a maverick to succeed is often very different to the way success comes in regular society. the maverick's success may change society, but the mavericks themselves may never be appreciated by wider society in their lifetimes, the change coming elsewhere or elsewhen.</li>

<p>mankind as the only animal that strains against the flow of change. there may be some upside to this behavior but I haven't come across those benefits yet, only seen the downsides and tried to understand and implement a solution to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>this may be because I do not think like an abusive person does — he would immediately know that manipulating people to stunt their ability to change is the source of his power over others.</li>

<ul>
<li>cue, routine, reward. uncover your cues, change the routines that they trigger. create new cues, stack new routines on established cues. do most difficult thing first, lessens mental load immediately. schedule days or blocks for related tasks — themes. rotate and re–evaluate routines</li>

<p>institutional inertia resists change, whether it is abusive or responsible. thus once an institution becomes mostly abusive (because its individuals are now mostly abusive) then it becomes a massive obstacle to responsible change.</p>
<ul>
<li>conversely, if can create and maintain a mostly responsible institution, it becomes a great enabler for responsible change. this is the central issue of corporate and institutional management, which people in abusive institutions may never understand, face, or accept. this too is the crucial issue for personal responsibility — if we do not do so, then we become abusive.</li>

<p>in computing or biology, the time in which a static fact or process description is a valid representation of reality can be as short as hours or days. it is important to reassess information whenever we encounter it, to understand how, if at all, it still represents reality.</p>

<p><em>system justification</em><br />
people are motivated to rationalize the status quo as legitimate—even if it goes directly against their interests.</p>

<p>People like to think that what they do is immutable, that it is justified, and not only that, but justified since antiquity. Sometimes when people think about their achievements within a framework, such as science, or religion, or politics, this assumption colours and biases their way of thinking. It distorts understanding because it simply is not true.<br />
The premise is that nothing can have maintained its existence for a long time if it does not pertain to reality, or, as they say it, the truth. (lead to discussion of probability as indicator for )<br />
One spell they were under is to conflate existence with goodness.</p>

<p>The Santa Ana in La Jolla or the Föhn in Germany or other changes of weather are not dangerous in themselves. We may be able to explain the illnesses they seem to bring by an analogy to rain runoff in La Jolla. These processes are dangerous because contaminants — created by human technology, industry and activity for example — which were stationary until the change of weather, are now stirred up and mobile, and distributed to humans. For example, dog faecal bacteria, freeway rubber tire tailings, pesticide residues, illegal industrial dumping, or radioactive dust — downright dangerous!<br />
In La Jolla, it rarely rains so these kinds of contaminants are collected on the land and wash off in large quantities and concentrations when it rains. The storm drains lead to the sewers which lead to the sea. It is extremely unwise to be in the nearby sea soon after a rainstorm because of the effects this runoff cause.</p>

<li>not fixed and growth, but rather live and die; change and changeless.
<ul>
<li>our misunderstanding of the process of change makes it much more difficult to make useful changes in our lives</li>
<li>what I see changed in lena is the inculcation of the fixed mindset. whether this is because of certain people or whether it Is because of language, I may never know.
<ul>
<li>is it that die–mindset people learn the basics of static language but not the meta level of living, changing language?</li>
<li>is this how words can become a prison, a spell that binds us?</li>

<li>this may be where religion or dogma become evil, when they insist that god is only changeless and only eternal rather than also changing, not only die or live but both together.</li>
<li>banality of evil may be consequence of not understanding change. how we steadily creep to unreality and thus evil if we do not engage in the world and change with it.</li>
<li>the way we write has been to forget time and describe constancy. even with mathematics and graphs, which are also perfectly capable of displaying variation with time, we mostly neglect to show change, instead projecting constant certainty into the future.</li>
<li>constancy is worshipped as a virtue because of religious reasons.</li>
<li>by insisting on static, no change unless instigated by them, they ensure that when change does come it is turbulent and sudden rather than smooth and gradual.</li>
