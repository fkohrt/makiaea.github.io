<p>sometimes late at night<br />
i lie awake and watch her sleeping<br />
she’s lost in peaceful dreams<br />
so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark<br />
and the thought crosses my mind<br />
if i never wake in the morning<br />
would she ever doubt the way i feel<br />
about her in my heart</p>
<p>☆if tomorrow never comes<br />
　will she know how much i loved her<br />
　did i try in every way to show her every day<br />
　that she’s my only one<br />
　and if my time on earth were through<br />
　and she must face the world without me<br />
　will the love i gave her in the past<br />
　be enough to last<br />
　if tomorrow never comes</p>
<p>for i’ve lost loved ones in my life<br />
who never knew how much i loved them<br />
now i live with the regret<br />
that my true feelings for them never were revealed<br />
so i made a promise to myself<br />
to say each day how much she means to me<br />
and avoid that circumstance<br />
where there’s no second chance<br />
to tell her how i feel</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>so tell that someone that you love<br />
just what you’re thinking of<br />
if tomorrow never comes</p>

<p>from his blog:<br />
“Now let us get deeper into the application of the Silver Rule in intellectual debates. You can criticize either what a person <em>said</em> or what the person <em>meant</em>. The former is more sensational, hence lends itself more readily to dissemination. The mark of a charlatan –say the journalist Sam Harris –is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on some of his/her specific statement (“look at what he said”) rather than blasting his exact position (“look at what he means” or, more broadly, “look at what he stands for”), the latter of which requires an extensive grasp of the proposed idea. Note that the same applies to the interpretation of religious texts, often extracted from their broader circumstances.”</p>

<li>
<p>is it the fate of all great thinkers to end up like this? to make the great ideas they need to believe in themselves, but in the end this becomes their downfall as this belief means they no longer respond to reality, a reality that has now moved beyond their idea.</p>
<p>or is this the fate of everyone, and is why we must all eventually die to make room for those who are still malleable?</p>

<p><em>the true tempo of evolutionary radiation and decline revealed on the hawaiian archipelago</em><br />

<li>Establishing the relationship between rates of change in species richness and biotic and abiotic environmental change is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Although exquisite fossil and geological records provide insight in rare cases<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref1">8</a>, most groups lack high-quality fossil records. Consequently, biologists typically rely on molecular phylogenies to study the diversity dynamics of clades, usually by correlating changes in diversification rate with environmental or trait shifts<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref2">9</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref3">10</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref4">11</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref5">12</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref6">13</a>. However, inferences drawn from molecular phylogenies can be limited owing to the challenge of accounting for extinct species, making it difficult<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref7">14</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref8">15</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref9">16</a> to accurately determine the underlying diversity dynamics that produce them. Here, using a geologically informed model of the relationship between changing island area and species richness for the Hawaiian archipelago, we infer the rates of species richness change for 14 endemic groups over their entire evolutionary histories without the need for fossil data, or molecular phylogenies. We find that these endemic clades underwent evolutionary radiations characterized by initially increasing rates of species accumulation, followed by slow-downs. In fact, for most groups on most islands, their time of evolutionary expansion has long past, and they are now undergoing previously unrecognized long-term evolutionary decline. Our results show how landscape dynamism can drive evolutionary dynamics over broad timescales<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref10">17</a>, including driving species loss that is not readily detected using molecular phylogenies, or without a rich fossil record<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21675.html#ref11">18</a>. We anticipate that examination of other clades where the relationship between environmental change and species richness change can be quantified will reveal that many other living groups have also experienced similarly complex evolutionary trajectories, including long-term and ongoing evolutionary decline.</li>

<p><em>large-scale subduction of continental crust implied by india–asia mass-balance calculation</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Continental crust is buoyant compared with its oceanic counterpart and resists subduction into the mantle. When two continents collide, the mass balance for the continental crust is therefore assumed to be maintained. Here we use estimates of pre-collisional crustal thickness and convergence history derived from plate kinematic models to calculate the crustal mass balance in the India–Asia collisional system. Using the current best estimates for the timing of the diachronous onset of collision between India and Eurasia, we find that about 50% of the pre-collisional continental crustal mass cannot be accounted for in the crustal reservoir preserved at Earth’s surface today—represented by the mass preserved in the thickened crust that makes up the Himalaya, Tibet and much of adjacent Asia, as well as southeast Asian tectonic escape and exported eroded sediments. This implies large-scale subduction of continental crust during the collision, with a mass equivalent to about 15% of the total oceanic crustal subduction flux since 56 million years ago. We suggest that similar contamination of the mantle by direct input of radiogenic continental crustal materials during past continent–continent collisions is reflected in some ocean crust and ocean island basalt geochemistry. The subduction of continental crust may therefore contribute significantly to the evolution of mantle geochemistry.</li>

<p><em>from dead woods to triumph of nature, 30 years after the Great Storm</em><br />

<li>
<p>The devastating winds of 1987 felled 15 million trees but also prompted a radical change to the way we work with the countryside to let it heal itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is remembered as a generation-defining moment, the night when ships ran aground, London endured its first blackout since the Blitz, 18 people died and 15 million trees were toppled. But the devastation wrought by the Great Storm of 1987 also left in its wake a startling woodland recovery, prompting a radical reshaping of the way we work with nature to care for the countryside.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago on Monday the storm hit south-east England after a fierce wind swooped up from the Bay of Biscay, across a corner of northern France before making landfall in the south-west and sweeping through southern England to bring the full force of its 100mph winds to bear on the south-east.</p>
<p>The storm did its work during the early hours of the morning, leaving behind a landscape that looked as if it had been subject to the whim of a particularly malevolent giant. “It seemed as if someone had pulled a curtain to one side to reveal a formless scene that bordered upon the underworld,” wrote the German writer WG Sebald in his 1995 novel The Rings of Saturn. “Entire tracts of woodland were pressed down flat as if they had been cornfields.”</p>
<p>For the then home secretary Douglas Hurd, the storm had produced “the most widespread night of devastation in the south-east since 1945”.</p>
<p>Ray Townsend, like most people living in the south-east at the time, vividly remembers the morning of the storm. “I remember waking up at 5.30 and there was no electricity. So I looked out of the window and it was completely dark. It was quite eerie.”</p>
<p>Townsend eventually arrived at Kew Gardens where he worked, and where he is now the arboretum manager. “The gardens at Kew had been obliterated,” he recalls. “The trees had gone over like dominoes. The wind had come off the river and the trees had gone down like a channel, a tunnel. Within that tunnel there was tremendous devastation. Some of the trees had been corkscrewed by the wind, like twisting the lid off a jar.”</p>
<p>A few miles away, at the National Trust’s Leith Hill site in Surrey, Paul Redsell had just settled into his new job as warden. He was woken at 6.30 by a neighbour asking for help to free a horse trapped in a stable by a fallen tree. Setting off on his motorbike to search for a working telephone, he came across trees laying on tracks and roads that were so obscured by debris that the only way of knowing where they ran was by following the raised banking on each side.</p>
<p>Eventually making his way to the top of Leith Tower, he was able to gain a view of the new landscape. “What was quite clear was that the storm had dipped in and out, there was devastation but not everywhere – there were pockets of destruction,” he says.</p>
<p>Redsell, who is now countryside manager at Leith Hill, followed what was then standard practice after a severe storm: he started to clear up. “Man loves being in control,” he says. “It was a natural event, and at the time there was almost a sense of urgency to go out and clean up. Once we’d gone in with machines and contractors and loading bays and all the rest of it, we were causing more damage than the storm had in some places. The urge was to remove all the fallen trees and then plant new ones with little plastic tubes around them.”</p>
<p>The clearing operations removed trees that might have regenerated and compacted soil that could have provided fertile ground for wild flowers. Intervention and clearing was not practised everywhere, however. At another National Trust site, Toys Hill, near Sevenoaks in Kent – which lost six of its eponymous oaks – 98% of the trees fell, and while clearing work took place across much of the site, an “exclusion zone” was set aside to allow nature the opportunity to repair the damage itself.</p>
<p>“Scords Wood was left alone,” says Tom Hill, the National Trust’s trees and woodlands specialist. “There’s been no intervention at all, and it’s now a thriving woodland in terms of its diversity.”</p>
<p>In nearby Knole Park, most of the trees that fell were also left, benefiting fungi, plants and wildlife, while in the neighbouring Emmetts Garden, where 95% of its surrounding woodland was lost, tree stumps and fallen specimens remain in the formal setting as a reminder of the storm.</p>
<p>Hill says the storm had a profound effect on the way we care for our woodland, with an understanding that decay has a role in promoting new life, and that nature is more than capable of adapting to changed conditions, and might even need them to survive. “There’s a better appreciation of decay as a natural process,” Hill says. “Veteran trees have decay and growth happening at the same time. One of the biggest attitudes that changed was the process of decay being seen as an integrated part of life not just something dirty or rotten.</p>
<p>“Storms mix things up, they allow light to get in, which is a vital factor. Toys Hill is like a mosaic of different habitats and light and shade, and it has a very diverse structure. That’s exactly what you want if you’re seeking to maintain healthy woodland. Destruction is very important, and nature is self-destructive and self-healing at the same time.”</p>
<p>Ed Ikin, head of landscapes and horticulture at Kew Gardens’s Wakehurst estate in West Sussex, where 20,000 trees were lost, says the storm marked a turning point. “It was the end of a chapter that dated back 200 years, the curation of trees knitted into ancient medieval woodland. People were disorientated, they couldn’t navigate, facing three years of tidying up. But in the midst of all of that trauma, what emerged was a grand vision, a desire to do something different with the wild landscape.”</p>
<p>That something was to promote diversity and to understand that we can learn from nature how to protect woodland and to adapt to extreme natural events.</p>
<p>“It’s hardwired into the ecology of some areas to have this moment of violence,” says Ikin. “Pre-1987 we had allowed too much of our tree stock to get to a similar age. The storm generated horizontal tornadoes, and we had created vertical planes of trees. Now we promote ‘shelter belts’ of trees to buffer and filter high winds.”</p>
<p>The lessons learned are starting to bear fruit, says Ikin. “Thirty years gives us the first real opportunity to look at the woodland and see if it’s doing what it was supposed to do. I think we’re starting to achieve something extraordinary.”</p>

<p><em>validation and diagnostic accuracy of predictive curves for age-associated longitudinal cognitive decline in older adults</em><br />
patrick j. bernier et al. 2017<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.160792">https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.160792</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The Mini-Mental State Examination continues to be used frequently to screen for cognitive impairment in older adults, but it remains unclear how to interpret changes in its score over time to distinguish age-associated cognitive decline from an early degenerative process. We aimed to generate cognitive charts for use in clinical practice for longitudinal evaluation of age-associated cognitive decline.<br />
<strong>METHODS:</strong> We used data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging from 7569 participants aged 65 years or older who completed a Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline, and at 5 and 10 years later to develop a linear regression model for the Mini-Mental State Examination score as a function of age and education. Based on this model, we generated cognitive charts designed to optimize accuracy for distinguishing participants with dementia from healthy controls. We validated our model using a separate data set of 6501 participants from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Uniform Data Set.<br />
<strong>RESULTS:</strong> For baseline measurement, the cognitive charts had a sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75% to 84%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI 88% to 90%) for distinguishing healthy controls from participants with dementia. Similar sensitivities and specificities were observed for a decline over time greater than 1 percentile zone from the first measurement. Results in the validation sample were comparable, albeit with lower sensitivities. Negative predictive value was 99%.<br />
<strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong> Our innovative model, which factors in age and education, showed validity and diagnostic accuracy for determining whether older patients show abnormal performance on serial Mini-Mental State Examination measurements. Similar to growth curves used in pediatrics, cognitive charts allow longitudinal cognitive evaluation and enable prompt initiation of investigation and treatment when appropriate.<br />
<a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/volpage/189/E1470">See related article at</a> <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.171295">www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.171295</a><br />
Epidemiological evidence suggests that dementia poses a threat to public health worldwide.<strong>1</strong> Advancing age is the leading factor driving this threat.<strong>2</strong> To date, no curative treatment is available for Alzheimer disease, the most common cause of dementia. However, disease-modifying treatments are being tested in clinical trials, and modifiable risk factors can be addressed to delay onset before irreversible brain damage occurs.<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong><br />
Preventive efforts encourage the aging population to seek help at the earliest cognitive change.<strong>5</strong>–<strong>7</strong> Standard work-up for dementia includes laboratory tests and imaging to rule out reversible conditions, as well as cognitive screening using the Mini-Mental State Examination.<strong>8</strong> When in doubt, the Mini-Mental State Examination is repeated at follow-up visits. Depending on performance and whether functional decline is present, physicians will either make a diagnosis or refer the patient to a specialized memory clinic. How physicians should determine whether follow-up results from the Mini-Mental State Examination are compatible with age-associated cognitive decline<strong>9</strong>–<strong>12</strong> or represent mild cognitive impairment or dementia remains unclear. Cut-off scores are imperfect, notably for older adults with limited education or if the scores are not adjusted for age and education; within-subject comparisons are not allowed.<strong>13</strong>–<strong>16</strong> Normative data for the Mini-Mental State Examination exist,<strong>11</strong>,<strong>16</strong>–<strong>20</strong> but physicians seldom use them. Percentile tables do not allow longitudinal tracking of decline.<br />
We aimed to generate ready-to-use cognitive charts for follow-up of age-associated cognitive decline, analogous to pediatric growth charts,<strong>21</strong> based on key predictors of incipient decline in the Mini-Mental State Examination, to allow simple clinical follow-up of age-associated cognitive decline by first-line physicians using the Mini-Mental State Examination</li>

<p><em>aging and neurodegeneration are associated with increased mutations in single human neurons</em><br />

<ul>
<li>It has long been hypothesized that aging and neurodegeneration are associated with somatic mutation in neurons; however, methodological hurdles have prevented testing this hypothesis directly. We used single-cell whole-genome sequencing to perform genome-wide somatic single-nucleotide variant (sSNV) identification on DNA from 161 single neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of fifteen normal individuals (aged 4 months to 82 years) as well as nine individuals affected by early-onset neurodegeneration due to genetic disorders of DNA repair (Cockayne syndrome and Xeroderma pigmentosum). sSNVs increased approximately linearly with age in both areas (with a higher rate in hippocampus) and were more abundant in neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of somatic mutations with age—which we term genosenium—shows age-related, region-related, and disease-related molecular signatures, and may be important in other human age-associated conditions.</li>

<p><em>enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis reduces amyloid-β proteotoxicity</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Alzheimer’s disease is a common and devastating disease characterized by aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide. However, we know relatively little about the underlying molecular mechanisms or how to treat patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Here we provide bioinformatic and experimental evidence of a conserved mitochondrial stress response signature present in diseases involving amyloid-β proteotoxicity in human, mouse and <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> that involves the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitophagy pathways. Using a worm model of amyloid-β proteotoxicity, GMC101, we recapitulated mitochondrial features and confirmed that the induction of this mitochondrial stress response was essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis and health. Notably, increasing mitochondrial proteostasis by pharmacologically and genetically targeting mitochondrial translation and mitophagy increases the fitness and lifespan of GMC101 worms and reduces amyloid aggregation in cells, worms and in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Our data support the relevance of enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis to delay amyloid-β proteotoxic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease.</li>

<li>yin and yang not only about static existence of good in midst of evil, but also about change — about bad becoming good and also about good becoming bad</li>
<li>the purpose of evil, mark 2: is the purpose of evil, so–called evil, to destroy the good, so–called good? is it like death, that allows for renewal and change? which allow ephemeral flourishing? in this formulation, evil is necessary for good, not only to exist, but to perpetuate, because what is “good”, in the same way as those who are abusive, have few viable ways to correct their course — seemingly most people die before they can truly change. this is analagous to the cells in our body dying, while the body as a whole is renewed. if cells were to live forever, they would be abhorrent cancers that would consume and kill the body as a whole.
<ul>
<li>to transcend this cycle, where both good and evil are necessary, we must understand change, and actually change (as a process). then only will the need for evil be removed.</li>
<li>i wonder how many “philosophies” actually get to the point of thinking about this, let alone addressing it. probably few if any</li>
<li>i begin to realise why the concept of evil has survived, that there is something beyond the propaganda value of something to fight against — because if what is “good” necessarily becomes corrupted, then what comes to renew, replace, remove the “good” has always been called evil. this is not to say that we should accept abusers and abusive behaviour, but that beyond those “ordinary” manifestations of “evil”, there is something that we call evil but is actually renewal, something that is necessary that we are obscuring, hiding, denying with our language, our belief that there can be an “eternal good”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it is not that there is no such thing as good or evil, but that they co–exist together, in the same action, the same process. there is nothing which is solely good, and there is nothing that is solely evil, good and evil are names for parts of the same process.</li>
