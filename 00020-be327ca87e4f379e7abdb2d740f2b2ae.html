<li>an answer is to grow our society, one which rejects abuse so they can no longer take power from us. each and every person can relearn that these chains do not bind us. we awaken from this nightmare of abuse to a new dawn — the dawn of a great civilisation</li>
<li>it is not “idealism” that is counter to abuse, but understanding that whatever form abuse takes, we must counter it. if someone cries “idealism”, they parrot the arguments of abusive people without thinking, or are abusive themselves.</li>

<ul>
<li>“tolerance, viewed as a moral absolute, amounts to renouncing the right to self-protection; but viewed as a peace treaty, it can be the basis of a stable society. Its protections extend only to those who would uphold it in turn. To withdraw those protections from those who would destroy it does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this enforcement, the treaty would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force with proportional force, when that force is required to restore a just peace. We seek peace because on the whole it is far better than war; but as history has taught us, not every peace is better than the war it prevents.”</li>

<p><em>wealth inequality: the physics basis</em><br />
a. bejan, m. r. errera 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4977962">dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4977962</a></p>
<ul>
<li>“Inequality” is a common observation about us, as members of society. In this article, we unify physics with economics by showing that the distribution of wealth is related proportionally to the movement of all the streams of a live society. The hierarchical distribution of wealth on the earth happens naturally. Hierarchy is unavoidable, with staying power, and difficult to efface. We illustrate this with two architectures, river basins and the movement of freight. The physical flow architecture that emerges is hierarchical on the surface of the earth and in everything that flows inside the live human bodies, the movement of humans and their belongings, and the engines that drive the movement. The nonuniform distribution of wealth becomes more accentuated as the economy becomes more developed, i.e., as its flow architecture becomes more complex for the purpose of covering smaller and smaller interstices of the overall (fixed) territory. It takes a relatively modest complexity for the nonuniformity in the distribution of wealth to be evident. This theory also predicts the Lorenz-type distribution of income inequality, which was adopted empirically for a century.</li>

<p><em>benevolence-dominant, authoritarianism-dominant, and classical paternalistic leadership: testing their relationships with subordinate performance</em><br />
an-chih wang et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.06.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.06.002</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We propose a new typology of paternalistic leadership styles based on how leaders demonstrate authoritarianism and benevolence, the two essential components of this type of leadership. Benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership refers to leaders’ sole dependence on the use of benevolence without their strong assertion of authority, whereas authoritarianism-dominant paternalistic leadership is based mainly on authoritarianism itself; classical paternalistic leadership, which best fits early observations of paternalistic leaders, refers to the salient combination of both leadership components. We used two distinct samples and methods to test this typology and the association with subordinate performance. Across the two studies, a field investigation with Taiwanese military supervisor-subordinate dyads and a hypothetical scenario experiment with U.S. working adults, we found a positive relationship between classical paternalistic leadership and subordinate performance as strong as that between benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership and performance. Our findings echo the phenomenon that paternalistic leaders tend to combine benevolence with authoritarianism to affect subordinate performance.</li>

<p><em>witnessing violence in early secondary school predicts subsequent student impairment</em><br />
michel janosz et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>Almost all students witnessed school violence, which predicted impairment. Witnessing violence was associated with risk of subsequent adjustment problems 2 years later. Directly experienced victimisation showed a comparable magnitude of risk. This suggests that when it comes to symptoms of conduct disorder, witnessing violence might have the same impact as experiencing it directly. Witnessing earlier covert and major violence predicted social impairment whereas minor violence predicted psychological and academic impairment.</li>

<li>human rights don't exist, that is precisely the point. they are an attempt to describe what we as a society should afford to people, whether they are part of our society or not. and if we do not do so, we can expect people to understand we are abusing them, and they will act accordingly.

<li>the world today resembles an awful dysfunctional family: an abusive authoritarian parent, and an abusive manipulative parent. even then, if we unfortunate enough to lose one or even both of them, we are worse off.</li>
<li>abuse is like an ensnaring web rather than a simple chain — but we can help people break free of the web by helping them tear it apart.</li>

<ul>
<li>A key question to ask yourself when evaluating someone's message or actions is:<br />
“Are they doing this for the good of the world, or are they doing it to maintain someone’s power over others?”<br />
Often abusive people will try to cloak their abusive actions by appealing to what people want or have been led to want and believe. You will be able to easily evaluate whether their actions actually match what they say, or whether they intend to deceive you.</li>

<li>suggestibility, mesmerisability, hypnosis, these work by bypassing our conscious filters and suggestions entering our subconscious brains more directly. these are signs that abusive people look for in their potential victims. suggestions most likely constantly enter subconsciously — it is just that under these conditions they are particularly effective and thus potentially more dangerous.
<ul>
<li>so a young teenager reading deep into the night, a sleep deprived new–parent, people trapped by their environment in centrally heated homes, older people with sleep apnea, soldiers and civilians at war, all are likely to experience strange dreams and are particularly susceptible to what can influence them — be it televised or immediate violence, simulated reality in fiction, or political and abusive demagogues.</li>
<li>when we are chronically sleep deprived, such as when we have central–heating–dehydration–induced sleep apnea, or when we regularly sleep on a full stomach without being able to regulate our temperature (for example thick duvet, random heat jumps through central heating switching on and off from thermostat), that is when we can be particularly suggestible.</li>

<li>i intensely dislike it when people lie. when people lie, it makes life much more difficult, for themselves and others
<ul>
<li>but how do people get in the habit of lying?</li>
<li>mostly it is because people are trained to do it by other people.</li>
<li>at first they might do it because they believe it will gain them some advantage, but eventually it just becomes a habit, a spell which, in the societies of the early twenty-first century, is rarely broken.</li>
<li>no, this is the truth. the rich politicians and businessmen accrete power which is not theirs to have. they have done so overwhelmingly by lying, to themselves and to others about what their real objectives are. those objectives were originaly to gain power, but have now simply become an addictive, abusive habit.</li>

<h2>01620</h2>
<h2>01520</h2>
<ul>
<li>people who are abusive in one major way are very likely to be abusive in other major ways. this is because the source of their abusive behaviour is similar. a person who desires power is likely to be sexist and racist — because to allow themselves to be abusive and take power from others, they value others much less than themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01420</h2>
<ul>
<li>one of the first things an abuser will try to make you believe is that there is no escape, that there is no alternative to submitting to their abuse. often they will even believe this is true — if they were abused in the past, their abusers may have trained them to believe it.</li>
</ul>

<li>diversion
<ul>
<li>“less than a dollar a day, no need to worry about environment” is argument proposed by abusive people. it is people who have least buffer who are most vulnerable, and what the abuser wants is to pair “less” with the feeling of desperation.</li>
<li>in a world full of abuse, some say it is “priviledged” to speak of some smaller abuse that they perpetuate. but that too is an abusive argument — they want us to feel their abuse is less than worst, that it is not abuse.</li>
<li>question of “if gandhi was so great, why were his family not also?” leave aside truth of whether statement about gandhi or family is true, what is speaker saying? he says “if X is good, why is Y, which is associated with X, not also good?”

<li>divide and conquer
<ul>
<li>they try to teach us to isolate ourselves, so that we become easier for them to manipulate — when we are encouraged to turn away from someone just because they do not share all our current opinions, we end up turning away everybody. this is how they at once unite and divide us — united in our loneliness and fear and striking at the enemies our abusers choose for us, and divided to stop us opposing their abuse</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>00820</h2>
<ul>
<li>purity, sanctity, perfection, eternity, disgust, hatred, fear, evil, immutability: these are all things abusers wish us to believe in so they can take our power.
<ul>
<li>to make us believe in evil is necessary concept if the abusers want us to believe we are powerless, that they are the only saviours who can rescue us, that we must trust and believe in them.</li>
<li>abusers created the concept of evil. people's belief in evil helps abusers control and manipulate them, to make them slaves and pawns in wars against other abusers.</li>

<li>Black–and–white opinions are a coping strategy for people’s fears.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00720</h2>
<h2>00620</h2>
<ul>
<li>the difference between intentional abusers and everybody else is: they want to perpetuate abuse, rather than want love to replace abuse.</li>
<li>what is love? in the simplest words, that is what it is — wishing better for all, rather than worse.</li>
<li>to live lovingly, we must confront abuse of others and within ourselves. let us speak today of some ways to live lovingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00520</h2>
<ul>
<li>whether abuse of resources, influence or omission — the abuse must stop</li>
<li>this is how you can spot abusers, because their influence is in one direction only, to perpetuate myths and lies that force people into false certainty, rather than to cherish diversity and the living, changing, reality of life.</li>
<li>why can it difficult to deal with abusive people? unfortunately they have different understanding of what is reasonable; by definition they are acting selfishly when we would expect them to be more considerate. unless we know they have a history of being abusive, we might not trust our judgement that they are abusive — in effect we are treating them as we would like to be treated, as a normal person who may just have some problems. unfortunately when we deal with an abusive person, they are unlike a normal person and treating them with consideration does not produce a good result. they will take advantage of your kindness, not because they are evil but because they they don't know how to behave better. so to preserve our sanity we need to communicate with them in a way they will understand. there may not be an easy way to do this as each person who acts abusively is abusive in their own way and to communicate you will need to understand their version of reality. one way is to say, &quot;that was mean,&quot; after they do something mean.
<ul>
<li>with responsible people this is much easier, because responsible people bring their own resources and act to understand your version of reality too; they are team players who play their part in a two–way communication. with an abusive person, the effort is only one way.</li>
<li>how do we determine if a person is abusive or not? you can see if they are abusive by their actions. everything they do will point towards their version of reality, and show how it may be distorted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00420</h2>
<ul>
<li>we too act abusively sometimes, in some places, even if unknowingly or without understanding we do.</li>
<li>as we all hold some beliefs that we have not examined, so we are all that part abusive. this is no idealism, no dream — it is why we all must do our bit, and those who intentionally do not do their bit are abusers.</li>
<li>there is only a very small difference between abusive and responsible behaviour — some people do not want to face the reality that they also sometimes behave abusively, but that does not mean reality does not exist</li>
<li>because it is especially difficult for people to understand how we ourselves are being abusive, one useful way of learning is by trying to understand how others are being abusive, and then applying that understanding to our own behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h2>00320</h2>
<ul>
<li>it may seem at times that abusers have the advantage — especially at individual level, where small numbers of abusers can use concentration of power in our societal systems to abuse in a way that magnifies and multiplies the effect of abuse.</li>
<li>but that is only part of reality. there are ways of being that can mitigate and dissolve that seeming advantage, and may provide us with seeming advantages of our own. among these ways is diversification — to shift power from concentration–of–power by changing the “concentration” process. another path we call “succession”, or “change” — renewal through death and birth, which also shifts power from individual abusers in some ways.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I hope this will be an easy read for you, for in our time, our culture had not developed far enough, and it would have been a very difficult read for most people.</p>
<p>I hope in your time the abusers are not so powerful as they were in ours, that you can learn without oppression, or perhaps that oppression and abuse are more recognisable to you than it was to us, so that you can avoid or deal with it more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine you are reading this a thousand years in the future. who are they teaching you to hate? who do they accuse of abuse? what do they try to hide from you, and why? is the locked door they say is to keep you safe, in fact a prison to keep you contained?</p>
