<p><em>disease dynamics in a stochastic network game: a little empathy goes a long way in averting outbreaks</em><br />
ceyhun eksin, jeff s. shamma, joshua s. weitz 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>Individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether they and/or those they interact with are healthy or sick. Healthy individuals may utilize protective measures to avoid contracting a disease. Sick individuals may utilize preemptive measures to avoid spreading a disease. Yet, in practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs. This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the self-interests of individuals during the spread of a susceptible-infected-susceptible disease. In this model, individuals strategically modify their behavior based on current disease conditions. These reactions influence disease spread. We show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick individuals above which disease is eradicated rapidly. Furthermore, we find that risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. Empathy is more effective than risk-aversion because when infectious individuals change behavior, they reduce all of their potential infections, whereas when healthy individuals change behavior, they reduce only a small portion of potential infections. This imbalance in the role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals on disease eradication affords critical policy insights.</li>

<p><em>from painkiller to empathy killer: acetaminophen (paracetamol) reduces empathy for pain</em><br />
dominik mischkowski, jennifer crocker and baldwin m. way 2016<br />

<li>“Simulation theories of empathy hypothesize that empathizing with others’ pain shares some common psychological computations with the processing of one’s own pain. Support for this perspective has largely relied on functional neuroimaging evidence of an overlap between activations during the experience of physical pain and empathy for other people’s pain. Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller, acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another’s pain. In two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, participants rated perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to reading scenarios about another’s physical or social pain, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts. As hypothesized, acetaminophen reduced empathy in response to others’ pain. Acetaminophen also reduced the unpleasantness of noise blasts delivered to the participant, which mediated acetaminophen’s effects on empathy. Together, these findings suggest that the physical painkiller acetaminophen reduces empathy for pain and provide a new perspective on the neurochemical bases of empathy. Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of adults in the United States each week.”</li>
<li>“A variant of this approach was recently used to show that placebo analgesia reduces empathy for others, an effect mediated by the opioid system (Rütgen et al., 2015a,b).”</li>
<li>“In summary, our research is the first to show that the popular physical painkiller acetaminophen can reduce empathy to the pain of others. Physical pain is an aversive experience, and un- doubtedly many people can attest to acetaminophen’s benefi- cial ability to suppress physical pain. However, acetaminophen can also have unappreciated psychosocial side effects by inter- rupting the fundamental capacity to empathically connect with other people’s painful experiences. Quite literally, acetamino- phen reduces one’s ability to feel another’s pain.”</li>

<p><em>the role of touch in regulating inter-partner physiological coupling during empathy for pain</em><br />
pavel goldstein, irit weissman-fogel, simone g. shamay-tsoory 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>The human ability to synchronize with other individuals is critical for the development of social behavior. Recent research has shown that physiological inter-personal synchronization may underlie behavioral synchrony. Nevertheless, the factors that modulate physiological coupling are still largely unknown. Here we suggest that social touch and empathy for pain may enhance interpersonal physiological coupling. Twenty-two romantic couples were assigned the roles of target (pain receiver) and observer (pain observer) under pain/no-pain and touch/no-touch conditions, and their ECG and respiration rates were recorded. The results indicate that the partner touch increased interpersonal respiration coupling under both pain and no-pain conditions and increased heart rate coupling under pain conditions. In addition, physiological coupling was diminished by pain in the absence of the partner’s touch. Critically, we found that high partner’s empathy and high levels of analgesia enhanced coupling during the partner’s touch. Collectively, the evidence indicates that social touch increases interpersonal physiological coupling during pain. Furthermore, the effects of touch on cardio-respiratory inter-partner coupling may contribute to the analgesic effects of touch via the autonomic nervous system.</li>

<p><em>look me in the eyes: constraining gaze in the eye-region provokes abnormally high subcortical activation in autism</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) seem to have difficulties looking others in the eyes, but the substrate for this behavior is not well understood. The subcortical pathway, which consists of superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and amygdala, enables rapid and automatic face processing. A specific component of this pathway – i.e., the amygdala – has been shown to be abnormally activated in paradigms where individuals had to specifically attend to the eye-region; however, a direct examination of the effect of manipulating the gaze to the eye-regions on all the components of the subcortical system altogether has never been performed. The subcortical system is particularly important as it shapes the functional specialization of the face-processing cortex during development. Using functional MRI, we investigated the effect of constraining gaze in the eye-region during dynamic emotional face perception in groups of participants with ASD and typical controls. We computed differences in activation in the subcortical face processing system (superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala) for the same stimuli seen freely or with the gaze constrained in the eye-region. Our results show that when constrained to look in the eyes, individuals with ASD show abnormally high activation in the subcortical system, which may be at the basis of their eye avoidance in daily life</li>

<li>“Besides knowledge of the other and appreciation of the difference, the Platinum Rule requires something harder—holding one’s own perspective at bay while thinking and feeling one’s way into the position of the other and then creating space for this perspective. Such effort requires a confluence of cognitive, affective, and motivational forces. Some researchers call this psychological work perspective-taking; some call it empathy, some compassion, still others social or emotional intelligence. Whatever the label, the results are worth the effort.”</li>

<p><em>the psychological health benefits of accepting negative emotions and thoughts: laboratory, diary, and longitudinal evidence</em><br />
brett q. ford et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000157">dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000157</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals differ in the degree to which they tend to habitually accept their emotions and thoughts without judging them—a process here referred to as habitual acceptance. Acceptance has been linked with greater psychological health, which we propose may be due to the role acceptance plays in negative emotional responses to stressors: acceptance helps keep individuals from reacting to—and thus exacerbating—their negative mental experiences. Over time, experiencing lower negative emotion should promote psychological health. To test these hypotheses, Study 1 (N = 1,003) verified that habitually accepting mental experiences broadly predicted psychological health (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and depressive and anxiety symptoms), even when controlling for potentially related constructs (reappraisal, rumination, and other mindfulness facets including observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity). Next, in a laboratory study (Study 2, N = 156), habitual acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotional responses to a standardized stressor. Finally, in a longitudinal design (Study 3, N = 222), acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotion experienced during daily stressors that, in turn, accounted for the link between acceptance and psychological health 6 months later. This link between acceptance and psychological health was unique to accepting mental experiences and was not observed for accepting situations. Additionally, we ruled out potential confounding effects of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life stress severity. Overall, these results suggest that individuals who accept rather than judge their mental experiences may attain better psychological health, in part because acceptance helps them experience less negative emotion in response to stressors.</li>

<p><em>feeling hangry? when hunger is conceptualized as emotion</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Many people feel emotional when hungry—or “hangry”—yet little research explores the psychological mechanisms underlying such states. Guided by psychological constructionist and affect misattribution theories, we propose that hunger alone is insufficient for feeling hangry. Rather, we hypothesize that people experience hunger as emotional when they conceptualize their affective state as negative, high arousal emotions specifically in a negative context. Studies 1 and 2 use a cognitive measure (the affect misattribution procedure; Payne, Hall, Cameron, &amp; Bishara, 2010) to demonstrate that hunger shifts affective perceptions in negative but not neutral or positive contexts. Study 3 uses a laboratory-based experiment to demonstrate that hunger causes individuals to experience negative emotions and to negatively judge a researcher, but only when participants are not aware that they are conceptualizing their affective state as emotions. Implications for emotion theory, health, and embodied contributions to perception are discussed.</li>

<p><em>associations of child emotion recognition with interparental conflict and shy child temperament traits</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Severe early adversity, such as maltreatment and neglect, has been associated with alterations in children’s recognition of emotion. We sought to build on such findings by testing whether children’s exposure to interparental conflict, a much less severe form of adversity, is also associated with children’s emotion recognition. Further, we sought to examine the role of temperamental shyness in these associations. We presented 99 9- to 11-year-olds (56 males) with photographs of actors posing as a couple portraying interpersonal anger, happiness, and neutrality, and children classified the emotions in the photos. Children reported on interparental conflict, and their mothers reported on children’s shyness. Children’s perceptions of threat regarding interparental conflict interacted with trial type (angry, happy, neutral) to predict accuracy; greater threat perceptions predicted less accuracy for neutral expressions, a relatively ambiguous stimulus type. Additionally, shyness interacted with children’s threat perceptions. At low levels of shyness, low levels of threat perceptions predicted high accuracy, whereas high threat, high shyness, and their combination predicted poorer accuracy. Results suggest the significance of interparental conflict in altering children’s emotion recognition and of shyness in strengthening such adaptations. These findings suggest that even forms of adversity that are less severe than maltreatment and neglect have substantial implications for emotion processing, particularly for children with shy traits.</li>

<p><em>social transmission and buffering of synaptic changes after stress</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Stress can trigger enduring changes in neural circuits and synapses. The behavioral and hormonal consequences of stress can also be transmitted to others, but whether this transmitted stress has similar effects on synapses is not known. We found that authentic stress and transmitted stress in mice primed paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, enabling the induction of metaplasticity at glutamate synapses. In female mice that were subjected to authentic stress, this metaplasticity was diminished following interactions with a naive partner. Transmission from the stressed subject to the naive partner required the activation of PVN CRH neurons in both subject and partner to drive and detect the release of a putative alarm pheromone from the stressed mouse. Finally, metaplasticity could be transmitted sequentially from the stressed subject to multiple partners. Our findings demonstrate that transmitted stress has the same lasting effects on glutamate synapses as authentic stress and reveal an unexpected role for PVN CRH neurons in transmitting distress signals among individuals.</li>

<p><em>severity of asd symptoms and their correlation with the presence of copy number variations and exposure to first trimester ultrasound</em><br />

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aur.1690">http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aur.1690</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Current research suggests that incidence and heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms may arise through a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous factors. While subject to routine clinical practice and generally considered safe, there exists speculation, though no human data, that diagnostic ultrasound may also contribute to ASD severity, supported by experimental evidence that exposure to ultrasound early in gestation could perturb brain development and alter behavior. Here we explored a modified triple hit hypothesis [Williams &amp; Casanova, 2010] to assay for a possible relationship between the severity of ASD symptoms and (1) ultrasound exposure (2) during the first trimester of pregnancy in fetuses with a (3) genetic predisposition to ASD. We did so using retrospective analysis of data from the SSC (Simon's Simplex Collection) autism genetic repository funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. We found that male children with ASD, copy number variations (CNVs), and exposure to first trimester ultrasound had significantly decreased non-verbal IQ and increased repetitive behaviors relative to male children with ASD, with CNVs, and no ultrasound. These data suggest that heterogeneity in ASD symptoms may result, at least in part, from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during early prenatal development of children with specific genetic vulnerabilities. These results also add weight to on-going concerns expressed by the FDA about non-medical use of diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy.</li>

<li>not only understand what kind of person someone is and wants to be but also what they can possibly be, when they are understood by someone. because we do not expect them to behave as they have done or are expected to behave, they have the opportunity to behave differently, and in most cases, better than they would have when they could not fully trust the person in front of them.</li>

<li>illusory model of input and output
<ul>
<li>when we use a serial model of input, sensory capture, cognitive processing, and memory, with subsequent output, it seems impossible that sensitive people can live with insensitive people. see diagrams. given that all factors will remain the same and deteriorate with time. (this is the assumption we wish to question) the only solution given that output of sensitive is to match that of insensitive (equality – also assumed) then the only way for this to be achieved is for the sensitive to drastically reduce their ability to capture sensation –– to die a partial death, in other words.</li>
<li>many sensitives have fallen into this trap, and abusive people continue to use this model to ensnare others. what to do? there must be something amiss with the model, but what is it?</li>
<li>instead of questioning the suitability of the model, most current practical solutions accept the model, and instead attempt to unsuccessfully decouple an aspect of it. for example, many sensitives turned to alcohol or drugs or even suicide to reduce their sensitivity or destroy their memory. ascetics try to decouple their cognitive process altogether. these are adaptive strategies which try to cope with the consequences of this model rather than deal with a root cause.</li>

<li>sensitive people assume they must be sensitive all the time.
