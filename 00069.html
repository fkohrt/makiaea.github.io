<p><em>ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle</em><br />

<ul>
<li>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</li>

<p><em>sleep architecture and the risk of incident dementia in the community</em><br />

<ul>
<li><strong>Abstract<br />
Objective:</strong> Sleep disturbance is common in dementia, although it is unclear whether differences in sleep architecture precede dementia onset. We examined the associations between sleep architecture and the prospective risk of incident dementia in the community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS).<br />
<strong>Methods:</strong> Our sample comprised a subset of 321 FHS Offspring participants who participated in the Sleep Heart Health Study between 1995 and 1998 and who were aged over 60 years at the time of sleep assessment (mean age 67 ± 5 years, 50% male). Stages of sleep were quantified using home-based polysomnography. Participants were followed for a maximum of 19 years for incident dementia (mean follow-up 12 ± 5 years).<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> We observed 32 cases of incident dementia; 24 were consistent with Alzheimer disease dementia. After adjustments for age and sex, lower REM sleep percentage and longer REM sleep latency were both associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. Each percentage reduction in REM sleep was associated with approximately a 9% increase in the risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.86, 0.97). The magnitude of association between REM sleep percentage and dementia was similar following adjustments for multiple covariates including vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms, and medication use, following exclusions for persons with mild cognitive impairment at baseline and following exclusions for early converters to dementia. Stages of non-REM sleep were not associated with dementia risk.<br />
<strong>Conclusions:</strong> Despite contemporary interest in slow-wave sleep and dementia pathology, our findings implicate REM sleep mechanisms as predictors of clinical dementia.</li>

<p><em>the effects of self-selected light-dark cycles and social constraints on human sleep and circadian timing: a modeling approach</em><br />
anne c. skeldon, andrew j. k. phillips, derk-jan dijk 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep45158">dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep45158</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we go to sleep late and struggle to wake up on time? Historically, light-dark cycles were dictated by the solar day, but now humans can extend light exposure by switching on artificial lights. We use a mathematical model incorporating effects of light, circadian rhythmicity and sleep homeostasis to provide a quantitative theoretical framework to understand effects of modern patterns of light consumption on the human circadian system. The model shows that without artificial light humans wakeup at dawn. Artificial light delays circadian rhythmicity and preferred sleep timing and compromises synchronisation to the solar day when wake-times are not enforced. When wake-times are enforced by social constraints, such as work or school, artificial light induces a mismatch between sleep timing and circadian rhythmicity (‘social jet-lag’). The model implies that developmental changes in sleep homeostasis and circadian amplitude make adolescents particularly sensitive to effects of light consumption. The model predicts that ameliorating social jet-lag is more effectively achieved by reducing evening light consumption than by delaying social constraints, particularly in individuals with slow circadian clocks or when imposed wake-times occur after sunrise. These theory-informed predictions may aid design of interventions to prevent and treat circadian rhythm-sleep disorders and social jet-lag.</li>

<p><em>new learning while consolidating memory during sleep is actively blocked by a protein synthesis dependent process</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Brief experiences while a memory is consolidated may capture the consolidation, perhaps producing a maladaptive memory, or may interrupt the consolidation. Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting <em>Aplysia</em> feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory.
<ul>
<li>Throughout our waking lives we are exposed to a continuous stream of experiences. Some of these experiences trigger changes in the strength of connections between neurons in the brain and begin the process of forming memories. However, these initial memory traces are fragile and only a small number will become long-term memories with the potential to last a lifetime. For this transition to occur, the brain must stabilize the memory traces through a process called consolidation.<br />
During consolidation, the brain produces new proteins that strengthen the fragile memory traces. However, if a new experience occurs while an existing memory trace is being consolidated, the new experience could disrupt or even hijack the consolidation process. To avoid this problem, the brain performs most consolidation while we are asleep. But what happens if we wake up while consolidation is taking place? How does the brain prevent events that occur just after awakening from disrupting consolidation?<br />
Levy et al. have now answered this question using a seemingly unlikely subject, the sea slug <em>Aplysia</em>. Sea slugs are capable of basic forms of learning, and their simple nervous systems and large neurons make them convenient to study. Blocking the production of new proteins in sleeping sea slugs prevents the animals from forming long-term memories, confirming that, like us, they do consolidate memories during sleep. Levy et al. now show that exposing sea slugs to new stimuli immediately after they wake up does not trigger the formation of new memories. However, if the slugs were treated with a drug that blocks protein production just beforehand, the new stimuli could trigger memory formation.<br />
These findings show that proteins blocking the formation of new memories prevent an experience upon waking from being effective in producing memory. Removing this block – by inhibiting protein production – allows experiences just after waking to be encoded in memory. This even applies to experiences that are too brief to trigger memory formation in fully awake sea slugs. The next step following on from this work is to identify these memory blocking proteins and to work out how they prevent new memories from forming. A future challenge is to find out is whether the same proteins could ultimately be used to block unwanted memories.</li>

<p><em>animals harmed in this experiment</em></p>
<p>Attention changes local brain activity</p>
<p>There is a well-known correlation between arousal and neuronal activity in the brain. However, it is unclear how these general effects are reflected on a local scale. Engel <em>et al.</em> recorded from higher visual areas in behaving monkeys and discovered a new principle of cortical state fluctuations. A special type of electrodes revealed that the state changes affected neuronal excitability across all layers of the neocortex. When the animals attended to a stimulus, the vigorous spiking states became longer and the faint spiking states became shorter. These states correlated with fluctuations in the local field potential. A sophisticated computational model of the state changes fitted a two-state model of neuronal responsiveness.</p>
<p>Neocortical activity is permeated with endogenously generated fluctuations, but how these dynamics affect goal-directed behavior remains a mystery. We found that ensemble neural activity in primate visual cortex spontaneously fluctuated between phases of vigorous (On) and faint (Off) spiking synchronously across cortical layers. These On-Off dynamics, reflecting global changes in cortical state, were also modulated at a local scale during selective attention. Moreover, the momentary phase of local ensemble activity predicted behavioral performance. Our results show that cortical state is controlled locally within a cortical map according to cognitive demands and reveal the impact of these local changes in cortical state on goal-directed behavior.</p>

<p>memory refreshing in stage 2</p>
<ul>
<li>“In the latest study, Walker and his team have broken new ground in discovering that this memory-refreshing process occurs when nappers are engaged in a specific stage of sleep. Electroencephalogram tests, which measure electrical activity in the brain, indicated that this refreshing of memory capacity is related to Stage 2 non-REM sleep, which takes place between deep sleep (non-REM) and the dream state known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM). Previously, the purpose of this stage was unclear, but the new results offer evidence as to why humans spend at least half their sleeping hours in Stage 2, non-REM, Walker said.<br />
“I can’t imagine Mother Nature would have us spend 50 percent of the night going from one sleep stage to another for no reason,” Walker said. “Sleep is sophisticated. It acts locally to give us what we need.”<br />
Walker and his team will go on to investigate whether the reduction of sleep experienced by people as they get older is related to the documented decrease in our ability to learn as we age. Finding that link may be helpful in understanding such neurodegenerative conditions as Alzheimer’s disease, Walker said.<br />
In addition to Walker, co-investigators of these new findings are UC Berkeley post-doctoral fellow Bryce A. Mander and psychology undergraduate Sangeetha Santhanam”</li>

<p><em>memory consolidation is linked to spindle-mediated information processing during sleep</em><br />

<ul>
<li>How are brief encounters transformed into lasting memories? Previous research has established the role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, along with its electrophysiological signatures of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles, for memory consolidation. In related work, experimental manipulations have demonstrated that NREM sleep provides a window of opportunity to selectively strengthen particular memory traces via the delivery of auditory cues,a procedure known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). It has remained unclear, however, whether TMR triggers the brain’s endogenous consolidation mechanisms (linked to SOs and/or spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn mediate effective processing of mnemonic information. We devised a novel paradigm in which associative memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) were selectively cued during a post-learning nap, successfully stabilizing next-day retention relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that, compared to novel control adjectives, memory cues evoked an increase in fast spindles. Critically, during the time window of cue-induced spindle activity, the memory category linked to the verbal cue (object or scene) could be reliably decoded, with the fidelity of this decoding predicting the behavioral consolidation benefits of TMR. These results provide correlative evidence for an information processing role of sleep spindles in service of memory consolidation.</li>

<li>Although the light‐induced melatonin suppression response is well characterized in adults, studies examining the dynamics of this effect in children are scarce. The purpose of this study was to quantify the magnitude of evening light‐induced melatonin suppression in preschool‐age children. Healthy children (<em>n</em> = 10; 7 females; 4.3 ± 1.1 years) participated in a 7‐day protocol. On days 1–5, children followed a strict sleep schedule. On day 6, children entered a dim light environment (&lt;15 lux) for 1‐h before providing salivary samples every 20‐ to 30‐min from the afternoon until 50‐min after scheduled bedtime. On day 7, subjects remained in dim light conditions until 1‐h before bedtime, at which time they were exposed to a bright light stimulus (~1000 lux) for 1‐h and then re‐entered dim light conditions. Saliva samples were obtained before, during, and after bright light exposure and were time anchored to samples taken the previous evening. We found robust melatonin suppression (87.6 ± 10.0%) in response to the bright light stimulus. Melatonin levels remained attenuated for 50‐min after termination of the light stimulus (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.008). Furthermore, melatonin levels did not return to 50% of those observed in the dim light condition 50‐min after the light exposure for 7/10 children. Our findings demonstrate a robust light‐induced melatonin suppression response in preschool‐age children. These findings have implications for understanding the role of evening light exposure in the development of evening settling difficulties and may serve as experimental evidence to support recommendations regarding light exposure and sleep hygiene practices in early childhood.</li>

<ul>
<li>Greater fish consumption is associated with improved cognition among children, but the mediating pathways have not been well delineated. Improved sleep could be a candidate mediator of the fish-cognition relationship. This study assesses whether 1) more frequent fish consumption is associated with less sleep disturbances and higher IQ scores in schoolchildren, 2) such relationships are not accounted for by social and economic confounds, and 3) sleep quality mediates the fish-IQ relationship. In this cohort study of 541 Chinese schoolchildren, fish consumption and sleep quality were assessed at age 9–11 years, while IQ was assessed at age 12. Frequent fish consumption was related to both fewer sleep problems and higher IQ scores. A dose-response relationship indicated higher IQ scores in children who always (4.80 points) or sometimes (3.31 points) consumed fish, compared to those who rarely ate fish (all <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). Sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between fish consumption and verbal, but not performance, IQ. Findings were robust after controlling for multiple sociodemographic covariates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that frequent fish consumption may help reduce sleep problems (better sleep quality), which may in turn benefit long-term cognitive functioning in children.</li>

<p><em>why we sleep</em><br />
matthew walker 2017</p>
<ul>
<li>“consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the <em>reception</em> of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward <em>reflection</em> —one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories”</li>
<li>the wake state principally as <em>reception</em> (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as <em>reflection</em> (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as <em>integration</em> (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).</li>
<li>Two recently published reports suggest humans have a very mild version of unihemispheric sleep—one that is drawn out for similar reasons</li>
<li>REM sleep is strangely immune to being split across sides of the brain</li>
<li>whether or not REM-sleep deficiency is a contributing factor to autism</li>
<li>The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around.</li>
<li>Those individuals who developed schizophrenia had an abnormal pattern of brain maturation that was associated with synaptic pruning, especially in the frontal lobe regions where rational, logical thoughts are controlled—the inability to do so being a major symptom of schizophrenia. In a separate series of studies, we have also observed that in young individuals who are at high risk of developing schizophrenia, and in teenagers and young adults with schizophrenia, there is a two- to threefold reduction in deep NREM sleep.XVII Furthermore, the electrical brainwaves of NREM sleep are not normal in their shape or number in the affected individuals.</li>
<li>the circadian rhythm of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. Children therefore become sleepy earlier and wake up earlier than their adult parents.</li>
<li>Adolescent teenagers, however, have a different circadian rhythm from their young siblings. During puberty, the timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is shifted progressively forward: a change that is common across all adolescents, irrespective of culture or geography. So far forward, in fact, it passes even the timing of their adult parents.</li>
<li>elderly individuals fail to connect their deterioration in health with their deterioration in sleep, despite causal links between the two having been known to scientists for many decades</li>
<li>the lower an older individual’s sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness.XIX Any individual, no matter what age, will exhibit physical ailments, mental health instability, reduced alertness, and impaired memory if their sleep is chronically disrupted. The problem in aging is that family members observe these daytime features in older relatives and jump to a diagnosis of dementia, overlooking the possibility that bad sleep is an equally likely cause. Not all old adults with sleep issues have dementia. But I will describe evidence in chapter 7 that clearly shows how and why sleep disruption is a causal factor contributing to dementia in mid- and later life.</li>
<li>what seems like an innocent doze has a damaging consequence. The early-evening snooze will jettison precious sleep pressure, clearing away the sleepiness power of adenosine that had been steadily building throughout the day. Several hours later, when that older individual gets into bed and tries to fall asleep, they may not have enough sleep pressure to fall asleep quickly, or stay asleep as easily. An erroneous conclusion follows: “I have insomnia.” Instead, dozing off in the evening, which most older adults do not realize is classified as napping, can be the source of sleep difficulty, not true insomnia.</li>
<li>Later chapters will describe the damaging influence of artificial light on the circadian twenty-four-hour rhythm (bright light at night). Evening light suppresses the normal rise in melatonin, pushing an average adult’s sleep onset time into the early-morning hours, preventing sleep at a reasonable hour. However, this same sleep-delaying effect can be put to good use in older adults, if timed correctly. Having woken up early, many older adults are physically active during the morning hours, and therefore obtain much of their bright-light exposure in the first half of the day. This is not optimal, as it reinforces the early-to-rise, early-to-decline cycle of the twenty-four-hour internal clock. Instead, older adults who want to shift their bedtimes to a later hour should get bright-light exposure in the late-afternoon hours.</li>
<li>I am not, however, suggesting that older adults stop exercising in the morning. Exercise can help solidify good sleep, especially in the elderly. Instead, I advise two modifications for seniors. First, wear sunglasses during morning exercise outdoors. This will reduce the influence of morning light being sent to your suprachiasmatic clock that would otherwise keep you on an early-to-rise schedule. Second, go back outside in the late afternoon for sunlight exposure, but this time do not wear sunglasses. Make sure to wear sun protection of some sort, such as a hat, but leave the sunglasses at home. Plentiful later-afternoon daylight will help delay the evening release of melatonin, helping push the timing of sleep to a later hour.</li>
<li>will even salvage those that appeared to have been lost soon after learning. In other words, following a night of sleep you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep.</li>
<li>Analogous to looping your favorite songs in a repeating playlist at night, we cherry-pick specific slices of your autobiographical past, and preferentially strengthen them by using the individualized sound cues during sleep.</li>
<li>Sleep powerfully, yet very selectively, boosted the retention of those words previously tagged for “remembering,” yet actively avoided the strengthening of those memories tagged for “forgetting.” Participants who did not sleep showed no such impressive parsing and differential saving of the memories.</li>
<li>“but when I wake up the next morning and sit back down at the piano, I can just play, perfectly.”</li>
<li>the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.</li>
<li>by inserting a nap at the front end of an incoming bout of sleep deprivation, you could insert a buffer, albeit temporary and partial, that would protect the brain from suffering catastrophic lapses in concentration</li>
<li>the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived. In contrast, the brain scans of those individuals who were given a full night’s sleep evinced a controlled, modest degree of reactivity in the amygdala, despite viewing the very same images. It was as though, without sleep, our brain reverts to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity.</li>
<li>the under-slept brain swings excessively to both extremes of emotional valence, positive and negative.</li>
<li>a prevailing view in psychiatry has been that mental disorders cause sleep disruption—a one-way street of influence. Instead, we have demonstrated that otherwise healthy people can experience a neurological pattern of brain activity similar to that observed in many of these psychiatric conditions simply by having their sleep disrupted or blocked. Indeed, many of the brain regions commonly impacted by psychiatric mood disorders are the same regions that are involved in sleep regulation and impacted by sleep loss. Further, many of the genes that show abnormalities in psychiatric illnesses are the same genes that help control sleep and our circadian rhythms.</li>
<li>at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Allison Harvey has been a pioneer in this regard.</li>
<li>By improving sleep quantity, quality, and regularity, Harvey and her team have systematically demonstrated the healing abilities of sleep for the minds of numerous psychiatric populations. She has intervened with the therapeutic tool of sleep in conditions as diverse as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and suicide, all to great effect. By regularizing and enhancing sleep, Harvey has stepped these patients back from the edge of crippling mental illness</li>
<li>Approximately 30 to 40 percent of these patients will feel better after a night without sleep. Their lack of slumber appears to be an antidepressant.</li>
<li>The reason sleep deprivation is not a commonly used treatment, however, is twofold. First, as soon as these individuals do sleep, the antidepressant benefit goes away.</li>
<li>The one-third of depressed individuals who respond to sleep deprivation may therefore be those who experience the greater amplification within reward circuits of the brain that I described earlier, resulting in far stronger sensitivity to, and experiencing of, positive rewarding triggers following sleep deprivation. Their anhedonia is therefore lessened, and now they can begin to experience a greater degree of pleasure from pleasurable life experiences.</li>
<li>The glial cells of the brain were shrinking in size by up to 60 percent during NREM sleep, enlarging the space around the neurons and allowing the cerebrospinal fluid to proficiently clean out the metabolic refuse left by the day’s neural activity. Think</li>
<li>wakefulness is low-level brain damage, while sleep is neurological sanitation.</li>
<li>In those sleeping five hours on average, the infection rate was almost 50 percent. In those sleeping seven hours or more a night in the week prior, the infection rate was just 18 percent</li>
<li>Irwin demonstrated that a single night of four hours of sleep—such as going to bed at three a.m. and waking up at seven a.m.—swept away 70 percent of the natural killer cells circulating in the immune system, relative to a full eight-hour night of sleep.</li>
<li>Dreams are not the heat of the lightbulb—they are no by-product.</li>
<li>The first function involves nursing our emotional and mental health, and is the focus of this chapter. The second is problem solving and creativity, the power of which some individuals try to harness more fully by controlling their dreams, which we treat in the next chapter.</li>
<li>(1) sleeping to remember the details of those valuable, salient experiences, integrating them with existing knowledge and putting them into autobiographical perspective, yet (2) sleeping to forget, or dissolve, the visceral, painful emotional charge that had previously been wrapped around those memories. If true, it would suggest that the dream state supports a form of introspective life review, to therapeutic ends.</li>
<li>To sleep, perchance to heal.</li>
<li>Sleep, and specifically REM sleep, was clearly needed in order for us to heal emotional wounds</li>
<li>Cartwright demonstrated that it was only those patients who were expressly dreaming about the painful experiences around the time of the events who went on to gain clinical resolution from their despair, mentally recovering a year later as clinically determined by having no identifiable depression. Those who were dreaming, but not dreaming of the painful experience itself, could not get past the event, still being dragged down by a strong undercurrent of depression that remained.</li>
<li>Cartwright had shown that it was not enough to have REM sleep, or even generic dreaming, when it comes to resolving our emotional past. Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly involved dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking trauma. It was only that content-specific form of dreaming that was able to accomplish clinical remission and offer emotional closure in these patients, allowing them to move forward into a new emotional future, and not be enslaved by a traumatic past.</li>

<li>if I could lower the levels of noradrenaline in the brains of PTSD patients during sleep, thereby reinstating the right chemical conditions for sleep to do its trauma therapy work, then I should be able to restore healthier quality REM sleep. With that restored REM-sleep quality should come an improvement in the clinical symptoms of PTSD, and further, a decrease in the frequency of painful repetitive nightmares. It was a scientific theory in search of clinical evidence. Then came the wonderful stroke of serendipity.</li>
<li>prazosin, which Raskind was prescribing simply to lower blood pressure, also has the fortuitous side effect of suppressing noradrenaline in the brain.</li>
<li>It may also unlock new treatment avenues regarding sleep and other mental illness, including depression.</li>
<li>Facial expressions represent one of the most important signals in our environment. They communicate the emotional state and intent of an individual and, if we interpret them correctly, influence our behavior in return. There are regions of your brain whose job it is to read and decode the value and meaning of emotional signals, especially faces.</li>
<li>And it is that very same essential set of brain regions, or network, that REM sleep recalibrates at night.</li>
<li>a dream-starved brain cannot accurately decode facial expressions, which become distorted.</li>
<li>the better the quality of REM sleep from one individual to the next across that rested night, the more precise the tuning within the emotional decoding networks of the brain the next day</li>
<li>when those same participants were deprived of sleep, including the essential influence of REM sleep, they could no longer distinguish one emotion from another with accuracy</li>
<li>the sleep-deprived participants slipped into a default of fear bias, believing even gentle- or somewhat friendly looking faces were menacing. The outside world had become a more threatening and aversive place when the brain lacked REM sleep—untruthfully so. Reality and perceived reality were no longer the same in the “eyes” of the sleepless brain. By removing REM sleep, we had, quite literally, removed participants’ levelheaded ability to read the social world around them.</li>
<li>law enforcement and military personnel, doctors, nurses, and those in the emergency services—not to mention the ultimate caretaking job: new parents.</li>
<li>this REM-sleep recalibration service comes into its own just prior to the transition into adolescence. Before that, when children are still under close watch from their parents, and many salient assessments and decisions are made by Mom and/or Dad, REM sleep provides less of a re-tuning benefit to a child’s brain. But come the early teenage years and the inflection point of parental independence wherein an adolescent must navigate the socioemotional world for himself, now we see the young brain feasting on this emotional recalibration benefit of REM sleep</li>
<li>this particular function of REM sleep, which takes hold at a particular developmental milestone, allows the burgeoning pre-adult brain to steer itself through the turbulent waters of a complex emotional world with autonomy.</li>
<li>During the dreaming sleep state, your brain will cogitate vast swaths of acquired knowledge,I and then extract overarching rules and commonalities—“the gist.” We awake with a revised “Mind Wide Web” that is capable of divining solutions to previously impenetrable problems.</li>
<li>the way in which the participants were solving the problems after exiting REM sleep was different from how they solved the problems both when emerging from NREM sleep and while awake during the day. The solutions simply “popped out” following awakenings from REM sleep, one subject told me, though at the time, they did not know they had been in REM sleep just prior. Solutions seemed more effortless when the brain was being bathed by the afterglow of dream sleep.</li>
<li>the REM-sleep brain was shortcutting the obvious links and favoring very distantly related concepts.</li>
<li>the brain becomes actively biased toward seeking out the most distant, nonobvious links between sets of information.</li>
<li>awake we are looking through the wrong end of the telescope if transformational creativity is our goal. We take a myopic, hyperfocused, and narrow view that cannot capture the full informational cosmos on offer in the cerebrum. When awake, we see only a narrow set of all possible memory interrelationships. The opposite is true, however, when we enter the dream state and start looking through the other (correct) end of the memory-surveying telescope. Using that wide-angle dream lens, we can apprehend the full constellation of stored information and their diverse combinatorial possibilities</li>
<li>both the act of dreaming and the associated content of those dreams that determine creative success.</li>
<li>It is the difference between knowledge (retention of individual facts) and wisdom (knowing what they all mean when you fit them together). Or, said more simply, learning versus comprehension. REM sleep allows your brain to move beyond the former and truly grasp the latter.</li>
<li>REM sleep is capable of creating abstract overarching knowledge and super-ordinate concepts out of sets of information</li>
<li>“How can I understand and connect that which I have recently learned with that I already know, and in doing so, discover insightful new links and revelations?” Moreover, “What have I done in the past that</li>
<li>might be useful in potentially solving this newly experienced problem in the future?”</li>
<li>Different from solidifying memories, which we now realize to be the job of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and the act of dreaming, takes that which we have learned in one experience setting and seeks to apply it to others stored in memory.</li>
<li>Antidepressants are often prescribed to help with the second and third symptoms of narcolepsy—sleep paralysis and cataplexy—as they suppress REM sleep, and it is REM-sleep paralysis that is integral to these two symptoms.</li>
<li>the brain is not done processing that knowledge after the first night of sleep. Memories remain perilously vulnerable to any disruption of sleep (including that from alcohol) even up to three nights after learning, despite two full nights of natural sleep prior.</li>
<li>How long is it before those new memories are finally safe? We actually do not yet know, though we have studies under way that span many weeks. What we do know is that sleep has not finished tending to those newly planted memories by night 3.</li>
<li>A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard bedding and clothing. This surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort.</li>
<li>People often tell me that they do not have enough time to sleep because they have so much work to do. Without wanting to be combative in any way whatsoever, I respond by informing them that perhaps the reason they still have so much to do at the end of the day is precisely because they do not get enough sleep at night.</li>
<li>REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity.</li>

<li>Older adults do not sleep as well as younger adults. Why? What alterations in sleep quantity and quality occur as we age, and are there functional consequences? What are the underlying neural mechanisms that explain age-related sleep disruption? This review tackles these questions. First, we describe canonical changes in human sleep quantity and quality in cognitively normal older adults. Second, we explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that may account for these human sleep alterations. Third, we consider the functional consequences of age-related sleep disruption, focusing on memory impairment as an exemplar. We conclude with a discussion of a still-debated question: do older adults simply need less sleep, or rather, are they unable to generate the sleep that they still need?</li>

<p><em>spike-based functional connectivity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus: loss of global connectivity is coupled to preservation of local connectivity during non-rem sleep</em><br />

<li>Behavioral states are commonly considered global phenomena with homogeneous neural determinants. However, recent studies indicate that behavioral states modulate spiking activity with neuron-level specificity as a function of brain area, neuronal subtype, and preceding history. Although functional connectivity also strongly depends on behavioral state at a mesoscopic level and is globally weaker in non-REM (NREM) sleep and anesthesia than wakefulness, it is unknown how neuronal communication is modulated at the cellular level. We hypothesize that, as for neuronal activity, the influence of behavioral states on neuronal coupling strongly depends on type, location, and preceding history of involved neurons. Here, we applied nonlinear, information-theoretical measures of functional connectivity to ensemble recordings with single-cell resolution to quantify neuronal communication in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats during wakefulness and sleep. Although functional connectivity (measured in terms of coordination between firing rate fluctuations) was globally stronger in wakefulness than in NREM sleep (with distinct traits for cortical and hippocampal areas), the drop observed during NREM sleep was mainly determined by a loss of inter-areal connectivity between excitatory neurons. Conversely, local (intra-area) connectivity and long-range (inter-areal) coupling between interneurons were preserved during NREM sleep. Furthermore, neuronal networks that were either modulated or not by a behavioral task remained segregated during quiet wakefulness and NREM sleep. These results show that the drop in functional connectivity during wake–sleep transitions globally holds true at the cellular level, but confine this change mainly to long-range coupling between excitatory neurons.</li>

<p>•Precise coupling of NREM slow waves and spindles dictates memory consolidation<br />
•Aging impairs slow wave-spindle coupling, leading to overnight forgetting<br />
•Age-related atrophy in mPFC predicts the failure of such coupling and thus memory</p>
<p>The coupled interaction between slow-wave oscillations and sleep spindles during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been proposed to support memory consolidation. However, little evidence in humans supports this theory. Moreover, whether such dynamic coupling is impaired as a consequence of brain aging in later life, contributing to cognitive and memory decline, is unknown. Combining electroencephalography (EEG), structural MRI, and sleep-dependent memory assessment, we addressed these questions in cognitively normal young and older adults. Directional cross-frequency coupling analyses demonstrated that the slow wave governs a precise temporal coordination of sleep spindles, the quality of which predicts overnight memory retention. Moreover, selective atrophy within the medial frontal cortex in older adults predicted a temporal dispersion of this slow wave-spindle coupling, impairing overnight memory consolidation and leading to forgetting. Prefrontal-dependent deficits in the spatiotemporal coordination of NREM sleep oscillations therefore represent one pathway explaining age-related memory decline</p>

<p><em>duration and timing of sleep are associated with repetitive negative thinking</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Higher levels of repetitive negative thinking (RNT; a perseverative and abstract focus on negative aspects of one’s experience) are associated with reduced sleep duration. This information is already informing theory and clinical practice. However, we are not aware of any studies examining the relation between RNT and the timing of sleep. We examined both disorder specific measures of RNT and a transdiagnostic measure of the RNT process in relation to sleep duration and timing in a sample of 100 unselected undergraduates. Replicating prior findings, shorter sleep duration was cross-sectionally associated with more rumination and delayed sleep timing was associated with more obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Further, extending this prior work, the transdiagnostic measure of RNT was associated with shorter sleep duration <em>and</em> delayed sleep timing. Individuals who endorsed a preference for later sleep and activity times also reported more RNT. These findings suggest that RNT may be uniquely related to both sleep duration and timing.</li>

<p><em>the effects of bedtime writing on difficulty falling asleep: a polysomnographic study comparing to-do lists and completed activity lists</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Bedtime worry, including worrying about incomplete future tasks, is a significant contributor to difficulty falling asleep. Previous research showed that writing about one’s worries can help individuals fall asleep. We investigated whether the temporal focus of bedtime writing—writing a to-do list versus journaling about completed activities—affected sleep onset latency. Fifty-seven healthy young adults (18–30) completed a writing assignment for 5 min prior to overnight polysomnography recording in a controlled sleep laboratory. They were randomly assigned to write about tasks that they needed to remember to complete the next few days (to-do list) or about tasks they had completed the previous few days (completed list). Participants in the to-do list condition fell asleep significantly faster than those in the completed-list condition. The more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep, whereas the opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities. Therefore, to facilitate falling asleep, individuals may derive benefit from writing a very specific to-do list for 5 min at bedtime rather than journaling about completed activities.</li>

<li>Viruses are intracellular pathogens that hijack host cell machinery and resources to replicate. Rather than being constant, host physiology is rhythmic, undergoing circadian (∼24 h) oscillations in many virus-relevant pathways, but whether daily rhythms impact on viral replication is unknown. We find that the time of day of host infection regulates virus progression in live mice and individual cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpes and influenza A virus infections are enhanced when host circadian rhythms are abolished by disrupting the key clock gene transcription factor Bmal1. Intracellular trafficking, biosynthetic processes, protein synthesis, and chromatin assembly all contribute to circadian regulation of virus infection. Moreover, herpesviruses differentially target components of the molecular circadian clockwork. Our work demonstrates that viruses exploit the clockwork for their own gain and that the clock represents a novel target for modulating viral replication that extends beyond any single family of these ubiquitous pathogens.</li>

<li>Human performance is modulated by circadian rhythmicity and homeostatic sleep pressure. Whether and how this interaction is represented at the regional brain level has not been established. We quantified changes in brain responses to a sustained-attention task during 13 functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions scheduled across the circadian cycle, during 42 hours of wakefulness and after recovery sleep, in 33 healthy participants. Cortical responses showed significant circadian rhythmicity, the phase of which varied across brain regions. Cortical responses also significantly decreased with accrued sleep debt. Subcortical areas exhibited primarily a circadian modulation that closely followed the melatonin profile. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms involved in maintaining cognition during the day and its deterioration during sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment.</li>
<li>our results demonstrate a regional modulation of brain circadian rhythmicity. Several subcortical responses show a strong circadian modulation but no significant influence of sleep debt. By contrast, in most cortical areas, sleep pressure exerts a widespread negative influence on regional responses. This differential regulation of brain responses might explain the supposedly “compensatory” responses repeatedly reported<br />
in thalamic areas during sleep loss.</li>

<li>Olfactory sensitivity has traditionally been viewed as a trait that varies according to individual differences but is not expected to change with one’s momentary state. Recent research has begun to challenge this position and time of day has been shown to alter detection levels. Links between obesity and the timing of food intake further raise the issue of whether odor detection may vary as a function of circadian processes. To investigate this question, thirty-seven (21 male) adolescents (<em>M</em> age =13.7 years) took part in a 28-hr forced-desynchrony (FD) protocol with 17.5 hours awake and 10.5 hours of sleep, for seven FD cycles. Odor threshold was measured using Sniffin’ Sticks six times for each FD cycle (total threshold tests = 42). Circadian phase was determined by intrinsic period derived from dim light melatonin onsets. Odor threshold showed a significant effect of circadian phase, with lowest threshold occurring on average slightly after the onset of melatonin production, or about 1.5 ○ (approximately 21:08 hours). Considerable individual variability was observed, however, peak olfactory acuity never occurred between 80.5 ○- 197.5 ○ (~02:22-10:10 hours). These data are the first to show that odor threshold is differentially and consistently influenced by circadian timing, and is not a stable trait. Potential biological relevance for connections between circadian phase and olfactory sensitivity are discussed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Physiological function, disease expression and drug effects vary by time-of-day. Clock disruption in mice results in cardio-metabolic, immunological and neurological dysfunction; circadian misalignment using forced desynchrony increases cardiovascular risk factors in humans. Here we integrated data from remote sensors, physiological and multi-omics analyses to assess the feasibility of detecting time dependent signals - the chronobiome – despite the “noise” attributable to the behavioral differences of free-living human volunteers. The majority (62%) of sensor readouts showed time-specific variability including the expected variation in blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol. While variance in the multi-omics is dominated by inter-individual differences, temporal patterns are evident in the metabolome (5.4% in plasma, 5.6% in saliva) and in several genera of the oral microbiome. This demonstrates, despite a small sample size and limited sampling, the feasibility of characterizing at scale the human chronobiome “in the wild”. Such reference data at scale are a prerequisite to detect and mechanistically interpret discordant data derived from patients with temporal patterns of disease expression, to develop time-specific therapeutic strategies and to refine existing treatments.</li>

<li>dream rem levels can change with nap. what if they also change with age? contrary to what book says, could it be declining rem make adults less creative? further consequences beyond scope of her book could include greater conservatism in older people due to lack of sufficient rem. note not ratio going down but quantity. could this also explain why the emerging tribes from saharasia became warlike? maybe it can, though we may never be able to tell for certain. Is this why parasites create conservatism in people who have high parasite loads? Because they disturb rem sleep? Too much heat generated at wrong time limiting rem. Think of whole community sleep disruption, making more warlike, less creative. Could explain the conservatism in a non–judgemental way as lack of appropriate sleep rathen than lack of innate ability. Must read the parasite load paper again, even though don’t like its authors. Reason all this is serendipitous is reading book on time, one on fall, one on sleep, and one on parasites, and then discuss with people, things happen in head while in my dreams. Always knew there was a reason why I was so creative, one which was not due to my innate ability but just to luck. Our peaceful society may be due to sleep afforded by oil consumption. This will end with peak oil and mankind may again become zombies as fear and lack of sleep claim them. This is the real zombie infection. So sequence goes environmental destruction leads to lack of sleep among other things, but end result is rise af a few warlords, who then spread the contagion. Picture it spreading in 4000BC, the wave crashing on the far shores of the Atlantic and Pacific last. Yet is this the reason why Industrial revolution came from England, and highest culture in Asia is in Japan? Who can say. Will it happen again in the zombie apocalypse? The likelihood is certain. It is already happening, all the shootings and loss of social cohesion, becoming easier for the dictator to rise and conquer, the zombie to infect and devour.

<li>let’s hope that lena has some benefit from the late meals that she has now. if I ever have full control over her mealtimes I would change this. having lena has been an extended experiment in sleep, not only hers but mine and the rest of the family too.</li>
<li>role of sleep deprivation in children’s and adults’ impulsive “naughty” behaviour — confirm in own observations of self and children that restful sleep and good nutrition make almost everyone lovely</li>

<li>do dreams reinforce our current ways of thinking? if dreams are to make sense (they often do not make sense), we interpret them according to our current ways of thinking. so if we believe in causality, we use causality to interpret what happens in the dream. but what if we know other ways of being, that we may not understand with words or concepts or ideas, and dreams also show us these ways?</li>
<li>do morning larks and night owls differ in memory retrieval because of differing amounts of rem (process forming) and non-rem (process clearing) sleep due to their differing sleep schedule? specifically, since more non-rem sleep and less rem for larks, sparser memories; less non-rem sleep and more rem for owls, denser memories but less chance for mental leap?</li>

<li>sleep is crucial in the learning process, but for most people, whether we sleep well is random, beyond our control — and so for most people, how well and what we learn is also beyond our control.

<li>learning to sleep well may be the crucial first step in changing our lives for the better</li>
