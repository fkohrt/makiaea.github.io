<p>haha that made me laugh! that's what happens when I draw anything — a generic representation by rules — the eyes are about here for this, this kind of dragon has four toes… playing piano I can do from “memory” but it’s a detailed relation between one note and the rest in the chord, and then the next… it can be very fast but it’s not recall, more like redoing? also interested in non–narrative “non–sensory” recall — I know when something is unjust but not by rationalisation. I think aphantasia is probably simplifying things quite a bit…</p>
<p>I just now read the new scientist article about it — “Kosslyn thinks the drawing sensation gives us a clue as to how aphantasics deal with apparently pictorial information. He suggests that to complete these tasks I am piggybacking on neurons involved in controlling physical movements rather than using the visual brain circuitry.” whoa.</p>
<p>seriously, this is probably more common than people realise — I have (relatively) useful adaptation mechanisms, others probably do too. also great from a diversity point of view…</p>
<p>I would like to study the coping/adaptation mechanisms that people use to compensate. also what advantages it gives</p>
<p>so my hunch is this is to do with the rebuilding of experience as we recall it — I can understand that my recall is through infilling of visual elements through an underlying process — but I don't “store” an image I store its components. I suspect in reality we all do this but people rationalize it differently — many people believe what they recall is what they saw</p>
<p>the chap in the article claims not to recall what happened to him during the day — I am not like that but my recall of what happened more than a few weeks ago is so sparse as to be almost non–existent. doesn't mean it's not in there somewhere, just I don't have ready access to it like other people do</p>
<p>or maybe I'm not so ready to believe that what story and scene I recall is actually a good representation of what actually happened</p>
<p>we are not questioning the basic assumption — our language assumes recall is sensory–based rather than something else. fmri studies of brain blood flow show brain blood flow — we are assuming our interpretation of the flow is correct, that when a similar region “lights up” on recall, the recall has identity with the initial experience</p>
<p>psychologists know recall is not initial experience, but not many people (psychologist or other) articulate that our “description of recall” is not recall — or do they,</p>
<p>we are not so different to those whose cultures have “three colours”. we have more words for more colours… seems I am with the “relativists” like John Lucy: “It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate</p>
<p>we say “the triangle was red” not “the triangle had … with a wavelength of …” — we “reconstruct” “red”, which is not “a wavelength of…” and that’s just the colour term — what about “triangle” and “was”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessing complex situations — it's like being able to speed–read rather than reading by sounding each word in my mind</p>
<p>generally not as attached to concepts that other people use as the basis for their values, including appearance — but rather more attached to things like honesty and responsibility. could be just me though…</p>

<ul>
<li>The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of <em>Aplysia</em> given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in <em>Aplysia</em> can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in <em>Aplysia</em> and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in <em>Aplysia</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet its causes remain unclear. Although recent findings support elevated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as a cause for epigenetic repression of synaptic genes that contribute to cognitive deficits, whether alterations in histone acetlytransferase (HAT) levels that counterbalance HDAC2 repressor action occur and the identity of these HATs remain unknown. We demonstrate that disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 homeostasis occurs early in the AD <em>Drosophila</em> brain and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes before Aβ plaques form. Increasing Tip60 in the AD brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition. Our data suggest that disruption of the Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance is a critical initial step in AD.</li>

<li>Understanding that suggestive practices can promote false beliefs and false memories for childhood events is important in many settings (e.g., psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal). The generalisability of findings from memory implantation studies has been questioned due to variability in estimates across studies. Such variability is partly due to false memories having been operationalised differently across studies and to differences in memory induction techniques. We explored ways of defining false memory based on memory science and developed a reliable coding system that we applied to reports from eight published implantation studies (<em>N</em> <em>=</em> 423). Independent raters coded transcripts using seven criteria: accepting the suggestion, elaboration beyond the suggestion, imagery, coherence, emotion, memory statements, and not rejecting the suggestion. Using this scheme, 30.4% of cases were classified as false memories and another 23% were classified as having accepted the event to some degree. When the suggestion included self-relevant information, an imagination procedure, and was not accompanied by a photo depicting the event, the memory formation rate was 46.1%. Our research demonstrates a useful procedure for systematically combining data that are not amenable to meta-analysis, and provides the most valid estimate of false memory formation and associated moderating factors within the implantation literature to date.</li>

<p><em>feelings of familiarity and false memory for specific associations resulting from mugshot exposure</em><br />

<ul>
<li>This research reveals that mugshot viewing accompanied by questions about an action can cause young adults to associate the pictured person and the queried action, leading to later false recollection of having seen that person perform that action. In contrast, mugshot viewing in older adults can lead to vague feelings of familiarity for the pictured person, encouraging older adults to later falsely recognize the pictured person performing any familiar action. Participants viewed events involving actors performing different actions and then were asked verbal questions about which actor had performed each action, with each question accompanied by mugshots of potential “perpetrators” of the action. In a later recognition test, older adults were more likely to falsely recognize a novel conjunction of a familiar actor and action if they had seen a mugshot of that actor, regardless of whether the mugshot had accompanied a question about that action. In contrast, young adults were more likely to falsely recognize a conjunction event only if it involved an actor whose mugshot had accompanied a question about that particular action. This effect remained when the analysis was limited to trials involving actors whose mugshots had not been previously selected, implicating false recollection rather than commitment effects.</li>

<ul>
<li>People frequently engage in future thinking in everyday life, but it is unknown how simulating an event in advance changes how that event is remembered once it takes place. To initiate study of this important topic, we conducted two experiments in which participants simulated emotional events before learning the hypothetical outcome of each event via narratives. Memory was assessed for emotional details contained in those narratives. Positive simulation resulted in a liberal response bias for positive information and a conservative bias for negative information. Events preceded by positive simulation were considered more favorably in retrospect. In contrast, negative simulation had no impact on subsequent memory. Results were similar across an immediate and delayed memory test and for past and future simulation. These results provide novel insights into the cognitive consequences of episodic future simulation and build on the optimism-bias literature by showing that adopting a favorable outlook results in a rosy memory.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>After psychological trauma, recurrent intrusive visual memories may be distressing and disruptive. Preventive interventions post trauma are lacking. Here we test a behavioural intervention after real-life trauma derived from cognitive neuroscience. We hypothesized that intrusive memories would be significantly reduced in number by an intervention involving a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris), via disrupting consolidation of sensory elements of trauma memory. The Tetris-based intervention (trauma memory reminder cue plus c. 20 min game play) vs attention-placebo control (written activity log for same duration) were both delivered in an emergency department within 6 h of a motor vehicle accident. The randomized controlled trial compared the impact on the number of intrusive trauma memories in the subsequent week (primary outcome). Results vindicated the efficacy of the Tetris-based intervention compared with the control condition: there were fewer intrusive memories overall, and time-series analyses showed that intrusion incidence declined more quickly. There were convergent findings on a measure of clinical post-trauma intrusion symptoms at 1 week, but not on other symptom clusters or at 1 month. Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that a larger trial, powered to detect differences at 1 month, is warranted. Participants found the intervention easy, helpful and minimally distressing. By translating emerging neuroscientific insights and experimental research into the real world, we offer a promising new low-intensity psychiatric intervention that could prevent debilitating intrusive memories following trauma.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both n=24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal fronto-parietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala ([graphic1]=.17). Connectivity analyses revealed that this down-regulation potentially engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 hours later ([graphic2]=.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (<em>r</em>=.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a non-invasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits (<em>e.g.</em>, amygdala deactivation) similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.</li>

<li>Memory is an adaptation to particular temporal properties of past events, such as the frequency of occurrence of a stimulus or the coincidence of multiple stimuli. In neurons, this adaptation can be understood in terms of a hierarchical system of molecular and cellular time windows, which collectively retain information from the past. We propose that this system makes various timescales of past experience simultaneously available for future adjustment of behavior. More generally, we propose that the ability to detect and respond to temporally structured information underlies the nervous system’s capacity to encode and store a memory at molecular, cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.</li>

<p>Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance. Here we assess functional brain network organization of 23 of the world’s most successful memory athletes and matched controls with fMRI during both task-free resting state baseline and active memory encoding. We demonstrate that, in a group of naive controls, functional connectivity changes induced by 6 weeks of mnemonic training were correlated with the network organization that distinguishes athletes from controls. During rest, this effect was mainly driven by connections between rather than within the visual, medial temporal lobe and default mode networks, whereas during task it was driven by connectivity within these networks. Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brain’s functional network organization to enable superior memory performance.</p>

<p><em>acoustic enhancement of sleep slow oscillations and concomitant memory improvement in older adults</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Acoustic stimulation methods applied during sleep in young adults can increase slow wave activity (SWA) and improve sleep-dependent memory retention. It is unknown whether this approach enhances SWA and memory in older adults, who generally have reduced SWA compared to younger adults. Additionally, older adults are at risk for age-related cognitive impairment and therefore may benefit from non-invasive interventions. The aim of this study was to determine if acoustic stimulation can increase SWA and improve declarative memory in healthy older adults. Thirteen participants 60–84 years old completed one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation in random order. During sleep, a real-time algorithm using an adaptive phase-locked loop modeled the phase of endogenous slow waves in midline frontopolar electroencephalographic recordings. Pulses of pink noise were delivered when the upstate of the slow wave was predicted. Each interval of five pulses (“ON interval”) was followed by a pause of approximately equal length (“OFF interval”). SWA during the entire sleep period was similar between stimulation and sham conditions, whereas SWA and spindle activity were increased during ON intervals compared to matched periods during the sham night. The increases in SWA and spindle activity were sustained across almost the entire five-pulse ON interval compared to matched sham periods. Verbal paired-associate memory was tested before and after sleep. Overnight improvement in word recall was significantly greater with acoustic stimulation compared to sham and was correlated with changes in SWA between ON and OFF intervals. Using the phase-locked-loop method to precisely target acoustic stimulation to the upstate of sleep slow oscillations, we were able to enhance SWA and improve sleep-dependent memory storage in older adults, which strengthens the theoretical link between sleep and age-related memory integrity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal cells are capable of driving and antagonizing behaviors of opposing valence. BLA neurons project to the central amygdala (CeA), which also participates in negative and positive behaviors. However, the CeA has primarily been studied as the site for negative behaviors, and the causal role for CeA circuits underlying appetitive behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we identify several genetically distinct populations of CeA neurons that mediate appetitive behaviors and dissect the BLA-to-CeA circuit for appetitive behaviors. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 1+ CeA neurons define a pathway for promoting appetitive behaviors, while R-spondin 2+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 2+ CeA neurons define a pathway for suppressing appetitive behaviors. These data reveal genetically defined neural circuits in the amygdala that promote and suppress appetitive behaviors analogous to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.</li>

<li>Positive effects of practice are ubiquitous in human performance, but a finding from memory research suggests that negative effects are possible also. The finding is that memory for items on a list depends on the time interval between item presentations. This finding predicts a negative effect of practice on procedural performance under conditions of task interruption. As steps of a procedure are performed more quickly, memory for past performance should become less accurate, increasing the rate of skipped or repeated steps after an interruption. We found this effect, with practice generally improving speed and accuracy, but impairing accuracy after interruptions. The results show that positive effects of practice can interact with architectural constraints on episodic memory to have negative effects on performance. In practical terms, the results suggest that practice can be a risk factor for procedural errors in task environments with a high incidence of task interruption.</li>
<li>Compressed memory for past events is not the only mechanism that could mediate negative effects of practice on accuracy. Reason’s (1990) influential work on errors suggests two others, both linking elevated error rates to changes in routine. Practice could increase the strength of default steps or actions, increasing the error rate at choice points where the default happens to be incor- rect. Practice could also decrease the frequency of “attentional checks” on progress toward the goal, increasing the error rate when conditions dictate a change of course.</li>

<ul>
<li>Recent studies identified neuronal ensembles and circuits that hold specific memory information (memory engrams). Memory engrams are retained under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia. These engram cells can be activated by optogenetic stimulation for full-fledged recall, but not by stimulation using natural recall cues (thus, amnesia). We call this state of engrams “silent engrams” and the cells bearing them “silent engram cells.” The retention of memory information under amnesia suggests that the time-limited protein synthesis following learning is dispensable for memory storage, but may be necessary for effective memory retrieval processes. Here, we show that the full-fledged optogenetic recall persists at least 8 d after learning under protein synthesis inhibition-induced amnesia. This long-term retention of memory information correlates with equally persistent retention of functional engram cell-to-engram cell connectivity. Furthermore, inactivation of the connectivity of engram cell ensembles with its downstream counterparts, but not upstream ones, prevents optogenetic memory recall. Consistent with the previously reported lack of retention of augmented synaptic strength and reduced spine density in silent engram cells, optogenetic memory recall under amnesia is stimulation strength-dependent, with low-power stimulation eliciting only partial recall. Finally, the silent engram cells can be converted to active engram cells by overexpression of α-p-21–activated kinase 1, which increases spine density in engram cells. These results indicate that memory information is retained in a form of silent engram under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia and support the hypothesis that memory is stored as the specific connectivity between engram cells.</li>

<li>The production effect is the memory advantage of saying words aloud over simply reading them silently. It has been hypothesised that this advantage stems from production featuring distinctive information that stands out at study relative to reading silently. MacLeod (2011) (I said, you said: The production effect gets personal. <em>Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review</em>, <em>18</em>, 1197–1202. doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-011-0168-8">10.3758/s13423-011-0168-8</a>) found superior memory for reading aloud oneself vs. hearing another person read aloud, which suggests that motor information (speaking), self-referential information (i.e., “<em>I</em> said it”), or both contribute to the production effect. In the present experiment, we dissociated the influence on memory of these two components by including a study condition in which participants heard themselves read words aloud (recorded earlier) – a first for production effect research – along with the more typical study conditions of reading aloud, hearing someone else speak, and reading silently. There was a gradient of memory across these four conditions, with hearing oneself lying between speaking and hearing someone else speak. These results imply that oral production is beneficial because it entails two distinctive components: a motor (speech) act and a unique, self-referential auditory input.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most crimes have multiple eyewitnesses. The police typically interview co-witnesses separately. In time-sensitive investigations, this could slow down evidence accumulation. Having co-witnesses collaboratively recall a crime could potentially expedite evidence accumulation. However, past research shows that collaborative group members often have conflicting retrieval strategies that disrupt each other, degrading overall recall. This cost could potentially be overcome by aligning group members’ retrieval strategies with category clustering recall (CCR), which is a retrieval strategy where information is recalled from a series of forensically relevant categories (e.g., recalling the protagonists’ appearance, then actions). This study examined the costs and benefits of collaborative eyewitness memory by having collaborative pairs of strangers, nominal pairs (i.e., two individuals whose recall is pooled) and lone individuals watch a crime and recall it using free recall or CCR. The collaborative pairs recalled the crime faster than the nominal pairs. They also recalled more correct information than individuals but less than nominal pairs, irrespective of the retrieval method. There is therefore a speed-recall completeness trade-off when collaborative groups recall crimes. Importantly, all participants recalled more correct information when using CCR. This provides initial evidence suggesting that CCR is superior to free recall. Further research examining CCR’s benefits is recommended.</li>

<li>Studies have shown that generating errors prior to studying information (<em>pencil</em>–?) can improve target retention relative to passive (i.e., errorless) study, provided that cues and targets are semantically related (<em>pencil</em>–<em>ink</em>) and not unrelated (<em>pencil-frog</em>). In two experiments, we manipulated semantic proximity of errors to targets during trial-and-error to examine whether it would modulate this error generation benefit. In Experiment 1, participants were shown a cue (<em>band</em>–<em>?</em>) and asked to generate a related word (e.g., <em>drum</em>). Critically, they were given a target that either matched the semantic meaning of their guess (<em>guitar</em>) or mismatched it (<em>rubber</em>). In Experiment 2, participants studied Spanish words where the English translation either matched their expectations (<em>pariente</em>–<em>relative</em>) or mismatched it (<em>carpeta</em>–<em>folder</em>). Both experiments show that errors benefit memory to the extent that they overlap semantically with targets. Results are discussed in terms of the retrieval benefits of activating related concepts during learning.</li>

<p><em>gut vagal sensory signaling regulates hippocampus function through multi-order pathways</em><br />

<li>GI-derived vagal sensory signaling endogenously promotes hippocampal-dependent learning and memory function in rats</li>
<li>Previous work using electrical vagus nerve stimulation approaches involving non-physiological stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve (and is therefore not selective to GI vagal signaling) revealed improved word-recognition memory in humans following vagus nerve stimulation</li>
<li>gut to brain vagally-mediated communication has an important role in protecting against neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). For example, human patients with Alzheimer’s disease showed improved cognition following 6 months of chronic cervical vagus nerve stimulation treatment<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04639-1#ref-CR22">22</a>. At a mechanistic level, recent studies have indicated a functional role for the gut microbiome in regulating the interaction between GI signaling and cognition<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04639-1#ref-CR23">23</a>. For example, in germ-free mice that lack a microbiome, hippocampal BDNF levels are reduced<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04639-1#ref-CR24">24</a>, and these effects are associated with cognitive dysfunction</li>

<p><em>a resource-rational theory of set size effects in human visual working memory</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive ‘limitations’ arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.</li>

<p><em>mcm2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during dna replication</em><br />
nataliya petryk et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>During genome replication, parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). It remains unknown whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly. Here, we measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA strands with a weak leading strand bias, skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading strand increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism for how symmetric cell division is ensured by the replication machinery.</li>

<li>auditory recall
<ul>
<li>compare to jenny's memory, mine is quite sparse. now before I read research on non-western time-consciousness, and diana deutch's perfect pitch in tonal language speakers research, I wrote this off as faulty memory.</li>
<li>now however, in light of this research, we can positively review this.</li>
<li>firstly, if, as some recent research concludes, some people (confirmed mainly in non-western people) live more in the present than others, and given this, do not reprocess their long-term memories (and/or future plans) as much as others, then those memories should be correspondingly weaker. this seems to be the case in my memory.</li>
<li>interestingly, I do have some strong memories and they tend to be auditory-linked. while I may not be a typical subject in terms of diana's previous research (I.e. am not musically trained before age 5 nor fully native speaker of tonal language before age 5), it does point to a strong auditory influence in an otherwise sparse long-term memory.</li>
<li>interesting questions for further research might be, &quot;is (long-term) auditory memory stronger in speakers of tonal languages (than non-auditory memory and/or speakers of non-tonal languages?&quot; and &quot;what effect, if any, does a non-western experience of time have on (long-term) memory, and what effect, if any, does speaking a tonal language have on this?&quot;</li>
<li>do people specialise in certain ways (for example, music, memory) because of the way in which their recall systems are primed? by what means does this priming occur and what results from it?</li>

<li>if we don't have a word or label for something, does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?
<ul>
<li>if we do not have the concept of grey or greyish (some cultures do not, it seems) does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?</li>
<li>if we are taught that “foreigners are the enemy” but haven’t learned what an “oligarch” or an “abuser” is, who would we fight for or against?</li>
<li>we may know that we are being manipulated by the media and their handlers, but that is not the same as being able to do something about what we are immersed in, and how that effects our actions and beliefs — our culture effects us deeply in ways we don't understand, that we barely have the language or means to describe.</li>
<li>liberals might congratulate themselves on understanding great chunks of reality that conservatives do not deal with, like climate change, racism, sexism — but there are whole mountains, continents of reality out there, of abuse and responsibility, with people already living there and willing to share, and someday we too will learn how</li>

<li>study for recall
<ul>
<li>if generalise principle of studying–as–if–you–were–recalling helps performance, then we should not be studying as if for academic tests, as tests are rarely like recall situations in real life.</li>
<li>I want to learn and share the learning and to make notes efficiently as I go along reading, but I am also aware that this can sometimes get in the way of actually learning. for example it would be a good idea from the efficiency point of view, to write a mind map of each book as I read it, making each major section of the map the question that each section of the book tries to answer.</li>

<li>memory embellishment
<ul>
<li>it might be that i don't have a sparse memory — other people have memory embellishment that i lack. i seem to preserve and recall basic memories that are not embellished on recall, like a lot of people do</li>
<li>94% US professors believe they are “above average” as professors — study is not only wrong because of bias in selection, but if it were correct, up to 50% of respondents could actually be correct — what about them? it's all very well saying some are mistaken, but what about those who are correct?</li>
<li>false memories are part of our memory system — everyone has them and they are not an aberration. understanding this may improve relationships and influence our recall strategies</li>
<li>a lot of people seem to use narrative, but i seem to do this much less than most. for example, my memory and identity do not seem to be as strongly narrative–based as others are.</li>
<li>my memory is procedural, it excels at recalling procedures and paths. others have an episodic memory.</li>
