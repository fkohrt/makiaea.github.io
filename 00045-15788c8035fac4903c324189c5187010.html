<p>haha that made me laugh! that's what happens when I draw anything — a generic representation by rules — the eyes are about here for this, this kind of dragon has four toes… playing piano I can do from “memory” but it’s a detailed relation between one note and the rest in the chord, and then the next… it can be very fast but it’s not recall, more like redoing? also interested in non–narrative “non–sensory” recall — I know when something is unjust but not by rationalisation. I think aphantasia is probably simplifying things quite a bit…</p>
<p>I just now read the new scientist article about it — “Kosslyn thinks the drawing sensation gives us a clue as to how aphantasics deal with apparently pictorial information. He suggests that to complete these tasks I am piggybacking on neurons involved in controlling physical movements rather than using the visual brain circuitry.” whoa.</p>
<p>seriously, this is probably more common than people realise — I have (relatively) useful adaptation mechanisms, others probably do too. also great from a diversity point of view…</p>
<p>I would like to study the coping/adaptation mechanisms that people use to compensate. also what advantages it gives</p>
<p>so my hunch is this is to do with the rebuilding of experience as we recall it — I can understand that my recall is through infilling of visual elements through an underlying process — but I don't “store” an image I store its components. I suspect in reality we all do this but people rationalize it differently — many people believe what they recall is what they saw</p>
<p>the chap in the article claims not to recall what happened to him during the day — I am not like that but my recall of what happened more than a few weeks ago is so sparse as to be almost non–existent. doesn't mean it's not in there somewhere, just I don't have ready access to it like other people do</p>
<p>or maybe I'm not so ready to believe that what story and scene I recall is actually a good representation of what actually happened</p>
<p>we are not questioning the basic assumption — our language assumes recall is sensory–based rather than something else. fmri studies of brain blood flow show brain blood flow — we are assuming our interpretation of the flow is correct, that when a similar region “lights up” on recall, the recall has identity with the initial experience</p>
<p>psychologists know recall is not initial experience, but not many people (psychologist or other) articulate that our “description of recall” is not recall — or do they,</p>
<p>we are not so different to those whose cultures have “three colours”. we have more words for more colours… seems I am with the “relativists” like John Lucy: “It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate</p>
<p>we say “the triangle was red” not “the triangle had … with a wavelength of …” — we “reconstruct” “red”, which is not “a wavelength of…” and that’s just the colour term — what about “triangle” and “was”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessing complex situations — it's like being able to speed–read rather than reading by sounding each word in my mind</p>
<p>generally not as attached to concepts that other people use as the basis for their values, including appearance — but rather more attached to things like honesty and responsibility. could be just me though…</p>

<p><em>respiration modulates olfactory memory consolidation in humans</em><br />
artin arshamian et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3360-17.2018">http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3360-17.2018</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In mammals, respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and non-human animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a one hour awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared to mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.<br />
<strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong><br />
Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance the encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared to the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</li>

<p><em>working memory 2.0</em><br />

<p>Essentially the model posits that the brain operates working memory by coordinating ensembles of cells, or neurons, in the cortex with timely bursts of activity at the frequencies of specific brain waves. In the model, waves in the low “alpha and beta” frequencies carry our knowledge and goals in the situation (e.g. “I need tires that will last a long time but don’t want to pay more than $400.”) and regulate the higher frequency “gamma” waves that handle the new sensory information to be stored and manipulated, (e.g. the salesperson’s pitch that Tire set A will last 45,000 miles and cost $360, and tire set B will last 60,000 miles and cost $420). Meanwhile the temporary storage of that sensory information is achieved by how the interplay of these rhythmic waves changes the weight of connections among the neurons, called synapses.<br />
The new paper summarizes several lines of experimental evidence supporting the model, including from papers Miller’s lab published earlier this year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> and <em>Nature Communications</em> and in 2016 in <em>Neuron</em>. The evidence, and the model itself, challenges at least two classically held beliefs among neuroscientists. One is that brainwaves are merely byproducts of neural activity and don’t have functional meaning, and the other is that working memory is maintained by a persistent hum of neural firing, rather than short, coordinated bursts. But newer and more sophisticated techniques of analysis and measurement of neural activity amid working memory experiments in lab animals have shown otherwise, Miller, Lundqvist and Bastos write.<br />
For instance, in the <em>Nature Communications</em> paper, led by Lundqvist, the team showed the functional consequences of the different frequencies of waves. Animals were trained to play a game where they saw a sequence of two images and had to judge whether the next sequence of two had the same images in the same order. Recordings of neural activity showed a specific pattern of interplay between the wave frequencies, in which beta would decline to allow gamma to increase when information needed to be stored or read out. Beta would then increase and gamma would die down when information could be discarded. More strikingly, the researchers could see that deviations from this pattern correlated strongly with animals making mistakes. From specific deviations the scientists could even tell if the animal subsequently made the wrong decision based on the first or second of the test images.<br />
“This adds to mounting evidence that brain waves have a major functional role in the brain,” Miller said.<br />
In the <em>PNAS</em> paper, led by Bastos, the researchers not only measured this same kind of pattern of brainwave control, but also showed that the governing alpha and beta waves originate from deeper layers of the prefrontal cortex, while gamma waves originate in more superficial layers, just as neuroscientists had previously observed in the visual cortex.<br />
Some of the lab’s newest data, not yet published, suggests that this interplay of “top down” alpha-beta rhythms exerting executive control of “bottom up,” sensory-oriented gamma rhythms may be widespread around the cortex, therefore potentially governing other related functions such as attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Working memory is the fundamental function by which we break free from reflexive input-output reactions to gain control over our own thoughts. It has two types of mechanisms: online maintenance of information and its volitional or executive control. Classic models proposed persistent spiking for maintenance but have not explicitly addressed executive control. We review recent theoretical and empirical studies that suggest updates and additions to the classic model. Synaptic weight changes between sparse bursts of spiking strengthen working memory maintenance. Executive control acts via interplay between network oscillations in gamma (30–100 Hz) in superficial cortical layers (layers 2 and 3) and alpha and beta (10–30 Hz) in deep cortical layers (layers 5 and 6). Deep-layer alpha and beta are associated with top-down information and inhibition. It regulates the flow of bottom-up sensory information associated with superficial layer gamma. We propose that interactions between different rhythms in distinct cortical layers underlie working memory maintenance and its volitional control.</p>

<p><em>rna from trained aplysia can induce an epigenetic engram for long-term sensitization in untrained aplysia</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of <em>Aplysia</em> given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in <em>Aplysia</em> can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in <em>Aplysia</em> and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in <em>Aplysia</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet its causes remain unclear. Although recent findings support elevated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as a cause for epigenetic repression of synaptic genes that contribute to cognitive deficits, whether alterations in histone acetlytransferase (HAT) levels that counterbalance HDAC2 repressor action occur and the identity of these HATs remain unknown. We demonstrate that disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 homeostasis occurs early in the AD <em>Drosophila</em> brain and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes before Aβ plaques form. Increasing Tip60 in the AD brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition. Our data suggest that disruption of the Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance is a critical initial step in AD.</li>

<li>Understanding that suggestive practices can promote false beliefs and false memories for childhood events is important in many settings (e.g., psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal). The generalisability of findings from memory implantation studies has been questioned due to variability in estimates across studies. Such variability is partly due to false memories having been operationalised differently across studies and to differences in memory induction techniques. We explored ways of defining false memory based on memory science and developed a reliable coding system that we applied to reports from eight published implantation studies (<em>N</em> <em>=</em> 423). Independent raters coded transcripts using seven criteria: accepting the suggestion, elaboration beyond the suggestion, imagery, coherence, emotion, memory statements, and not rejecting the suggestion. Using this scheme, 30.4% of cases were classified as false memories and another 23% were classified as having accepted the event to some degree. When the suggestion included self-relevant information, an imagination procedure, and was not accompanied by a photo depicting the event, the memory formation rate was 46.1%. Our research demonstrates a useful procedure for systematically combining data that are not amenable to meta-analysis, and provides the most valid estimate of false memory formation and associated moderating factors within the implantation literature to date.</li>

<p><em>feelings of familiarity and false memory for specific associations resulting from mugshot exposure</em><br />

<ul>
<li>This research reveals that mugshot viewing accompanied by questions about an action can cause young adults to associate the pictured person and the queried action, leading to later false recollection of having seen that person perform that action. In contrast, mugshot viewing in older adults can lead to vague feelings of familiarity for the pictured person, encouraging older adults to later falsely recognize the pictured person performing any familiar action. Participants viewed events involving actors performing different actions and then were asked verbal questions about which actor had performed each action, with each question accompanied by mugshots of potential “perpetrators” of the action. In a later recognition test, older adults were more likely to falsely recognize a novel conjunction of a familiar actor and action if they had seen a mugshot of that actor, regardless of whether the mugshot had accompanied a question about that action. In contrast, young adults were more likely to falsely recognize a conjunction event only if it involved an actor whose mugshot had accompanied a question about that particular action. This effect remained when the analysis was limited to trials involving actors whose mugshots had not been previously selected, implicating false recollection rather than commitment effects.</li>

<p><em>an optimistic outlook creates a rosy past: the impact of episodic simulation on subsequent memory</em><br />

<ul>
<li>People frequently engage in future thinking in everyday life, but it is unknown how simulating an event in advance changes how that event is remembered once it takes place. To initiate study of this important topic, we conducted two experiments in which participants simulated emotional events before learning the hypothetical outcome of each event via narratives. Memory was assessed for emotional details contained in those narratives. Positive simulation resulted in a liberal response bias for positive information and a conservative bias for negative information. Events preceded by positive simulation were considered more favorably in retrospect. In contrast, negative simulation had no impact on subsequent memory. Results were similar across an immediate and delayed memory test and for past and future simulation. These results provide novel insights into the cognitive consequences of episodic future simulation and build on the optimism-bias literature by showing that adopting a favorable outlook results in a rosy memory.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>After psychological trauma, recurrent intrusive visual memories may be distressing and disruptive. Preventive interventions post trauma are lacking. Here we test a behavioural intervention after real-life trauma derived from cognitive neuroscience. We hypothesized that intrusive memories would be significantly reduced in number by an intervention involving a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris), via disrupting consolidation of sensory elements of trauma memory. The Tetris-based intervention (trauma memory reminder cue plus c. 20 min game play) vs attention-placebo control (written activity log for same duration) were both delivered in an emergency department within 6 h of a motor vehicle accident. The randomized controlled trial compared the impact on the number of intrusive trauma memories in the subsequent week (primary outcome). Results vindicated the efficacy of the Tetris-based intervention compared with the control condition: there were fewer intrusive memories overall, and time-series analyses showed that intrusion incidence declined more quickly. There were convergent findings on a measure of clinical post-trauma intrusion symptoms at 1 week, but not on other symptom clusters or at 1 month. Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that a larger trial, powered to detect differences at 1 month, is warranted. Participants found the intervention easy, helpful and minimally distressing. By translating emerging neuroscientific insights and experimental research into the real world, we offer a promising new low-intensity psychiatric intervention that could prevent debilitating intrusive memories following trauma.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both n=24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal fronto-parietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala ([graphic1]=.17). Connectivity analyses revealed that this down-regulation potentially engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 hours later ([graphic2]=.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (<em>r</em>=.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a non-invasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits (<em>e.g.</em>, amygdala deactivation) similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.</li>

<li>Memory is an adaptation to particular temporal properties of past events, such as the frequency of occurrence of a stimulus or the coincidence of multiple stimuli. In neurons, this adaptation can be understood in terms of a hierarchical system of molecular and cellular time windows, which collectively retain information from the past. We propose that this system makes various timescales of past experience simultaneously available for future adjustment of behavior. More generally, we propose that the ability to detect and respond to temporally structured information underlies the nervous system’s capacity to encode and store a memory at molecular, cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.</li>

<p><em>temporal proximity links unrelated news events in memory</em><br />

<li>
<p>&quot;Our research shows that people are constantly recording information about the order in which events happen, even if those events are unrelated. They can then use the order to help search memory,&quot; explains psychological scientist M. Karl Healey of Michigan State University.</p>
<p>Memory scientists have long been interested in determining whether temporal proximity acts as a tether of sorts that connects memories for different events. In most studies, researchers have tried to examine the phenomenon by asking people to memorize lists of words in the lab, but it is unclear how well this lab-based approach translates to memory for real-world events.</p>
<p>&quot;In the fall of 2016, I was obsessing over US election coverage and it occurred to me that many other people probably were, too. This provided the opportunity for a more naturalistic test -- we could ask people to remember news stories rather than word lists,&quot; Healey explains.</p>
<p>In one online study, Healey and coauthor Mitchell G.Uitvlugt collected and analyzed data following Election Day in 2016. The study participants had 7 minutes to recall as many election-related news stories as they could -- for each story, they also drafted a short newspaper-style headline.</p>
<p>Healey and Uitvlugt identified actual news stories that corresponded with the headlines generated by the participants, noting the date that the stories appeared. For their analyses, the researchers did not include stories that were not associated with specific election-related events. This process yielded 7,759 headlines from 855 participants.</p>
<p>The researchers then calculated a lag score that measured the transition, in days, from one headline in a participant's story sequence to the next.</p>
<p>The results showed that participants tended to recall stories in time-based clusters: Short transitions between stories (0 to 10 days) were much more common than would be expected according to chance. Furthermore, long transitions of more than 50 days were less frequent than one would expect by chance. The analyses showed that what participants remembered wasn't due to news events naturally clustering close together in time but rather the clustering of stories together in memory.</p>
<p>This pattern held even after the researchers accounted for similarity between events. And a second online study, in which a separate group of 561 participants recalled news stories from the previous 4 months, showed similar results.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised at how well these real-world data agreed with lab data,&quot; says Healey. &quot;Although remembering world events you've read about over the course of months seems different than memorizing a list of random words presented over the course of minutes, at a fundamental level it seems both are governed by the same principles.&quot;</p>
<p>Uitvlugt and Healey point out that the participants could not have prepared for the memory task, which rules out the possibility that participants used specific strategies when the events occurred to aid subsequent recall. Instead, the findings suggest that our memories are tagged with time-correlated information as we encode them, and that this information can be used when we search memory later on.</p>
<p>&quot;This research tells us something about memory in general. It suggests we all have a tendency to bind events together in memory when they occur near together in time,&quot; Healey says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Some memories are linked such that recalling one can trigger the retrieval of another. What determines which memories are linked? Some models predict that simply occurring close together in time is sufficient for links to form between memories. A competing theory suggests that temporal proximity is generally not sufficient, and existing evidence for such links is an artifact of using chainlike lists of items in artificial laboratory tasks. To test these competing accounts, we asked subjects to recall news stories that they had encountered over the past 2 years (Experiment 1) or 4 months (Experiment 2). In both experiments, subjects showed a strong bias to successively recall stories that appeared in the news within days of each other—even after accounting for the fact that stories that occur close in time tend to be semantically related. By moving beyond laboratory tasks, this research solidifies the foundation of contemporary memory theory.</p>

•Mnemonic strategies for superior memory can be learned by naive subjects<br />
•Mnemonic training induces similarity with memory champion brain connectivity<br />
•Brain network dynamics of this effect differ between task and resting state</p>
<p>Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance. Here we assess functional brain network organization of 23 of the world’s most successful memory athletes and matched controls with fMRI during both task-free resting state baseline and active memory encoding. We demonstrate that, in a group of naive controls, functional connectivity changes induced by 6 weeks of mnemonic training were correlated with the network organization that distinguishes athletes from controls. During rest, this effect was mainly driven by connections between rather than within the visual, medial temporal lobe and default mode networks, whereas during task it was driven by connectivity within these networks. Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brain’s functional network organization to enable superior memory performance.</p>

<p><em>acoustic enhancement of sleep slow oscillations and concomitant memory improvement in older adults</em><br />

<li>Acoustic stimulation methods applied during sleep in young adults can increase slow wave activity (SWA) and improve sleep-dependent memory retention. It is unknown whether this approach enhances SWA and memory in older adults, who generally have reduced SWA compared to younger adults. Additionally, older adults are at risk for age-related cognitive impairment and therefore may benefit from non-invasive interventions. The aim of this study was to determine if acoustic stimulation can increase SWA and improve declarative memory in healthy older adults. Thirteen participants 60–84 years old completed one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation in random order. During sleep, a real-time algorithm using an adaptive phase-locked loop modeled the phase of endogenous slow waves in midline frontopolar electroencephalographic recordings. Pulses of pink noise were delivered when the upstate of the slow wave was predicted. Each interval of five pulses (“ON interval”) was followed by a pause of approximately equal length (“OFF interval”). SWA during the entire sleep period was similar between stimulation and sham conditions, whereas SWA and spindle activity were increased during ON intervals compared to matched periods during the sham night. The increases in SWA and spindle activity were sustained across almost the entire five-pulse ON interval compared to matched sham periods. Verbal paired-associate memory was tested before and after sleep. Overnight improvement in word recall was significantly greater with acoustic stimulation compared to sham and was correlated with changes in SWA between ON and OFF intervals. Using the phase-locked-loop method to precisely target acoustic stimulation to the upstate of sleep slow oscillations, we were able to enhance SWA and improve sleep-dependent memory storage in older adults, which strengthens the theoretical link between sleep and age-related memory integrity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal cells are capable of driving and antagonizing behaviors of opposing valence. BLA neurons project to the central amygdala (CeA), which also participates in negative and positive behaviors. However, the CeA has primarily been studied as the site for negative behaviors, and the causal role for CeA circuits underlying appetitive behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we identify several genetically distinct populations of CeA neurons that mediate appetitive behaviors and dissect the BLA-to-CeA circuit for appetitive behaviors. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 1+ CeA neurons define a pathway for promoting appetitive behaviors, while R-spondin 2+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 2+ CeA neurons define a pathway for suppressing appetitive behaviors. These data reveal genetically defined neural circuits in the amygdala that promote and suppress appetitive behaviors analogous to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.</li>

<li>Positive effects of practice are ubiquitous in human performance, but a finding from memory research suggests that negative effects are possible also. The finding is that memory for items on a list depends on the time interval between item presentations. This finding predicts a negative effect of practice on procedural performance under conditions of task interruption. As steps of a procedure are performed more quickly, memory for past performance should become less accurate, increasing the rate of skipped or repeated steps after an interruption. We found this effect, with practice generally improving speed and accuracy, but impairing accuracy after interruptions. The results show that positive effects of practice can interact with architectural constraints on episodic memory to have negative effects on performance. In practical terms, the results suggest that practice can be a risk factor for procedural errors in task environments with a high incidence of task interruption.</li>
<li>Compressed memory for past events is not the only mechanism that could mediate negative effects of practice on accuracy. Reason’s (1990) influential work on errors suggests two others, both linking elevated error rates to changes in routine. Practice could increase the strength of default steps or actions, increasing the error rate at choice points where the default happens to be incor- rect. Practice could also decrease the frequency of “attentional checks” on progress toward the goal, increasing the error rate when conditions dictate a change of course.</li>

<p><em>silent memory engrams as the basis for retrograde amnesia</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Recent studies identified neuronal ensembles and circuits that hold specific memory information (memory engrams). Memory engrams are retained under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia. These engram cells can be activated by optogenetic stimulation for full-fledged recall, but not by stimulation using natural recall cues (thus, amnesia). We call this state of engrams “silent engrams” and the cells bearing them “silent engram cells.” The retention of memory information under amnesia suggests that the time-limited protein synthesis following learning is dispensable for memory storage, but may be necessary for effective memory retrieval processes. Here, we show that the full-fledged optogenetic recall persists at least 8 d after learning under protein synthesis inhibition-induced amnesia. This long-term retention of memory information correlates with equally persistent retention of functional engram cell-to-engram cell connectivity. Furthermore, inactivation of the connectivity of engram cell ensembles with its downstream counterparts, but not upstream ones, prevents optogenetic memory recall. Consistent with the previously reported lack of retention of augmented synaptic strength and reduced spine density in silent engram cells, optogenetic memory recall under amnesia is stimulation strength-dependent, with low-power stimulation eliciting only partial recall. Finally, the silent engram cells can be converted to active engram cells by overexpression of α-p-21–activated kinase 1, which increases spine density in engram cells. These results indicate that memory information is retained in a form of silent engram under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia and support the hypothesis that memory is stored as the specific connectivity between engram cells.</li>

<li>The production effect is the memory advantage of saying words aloud over simply reading them silently. It has been hypothesised that this advantage stems from production featuring distinctive information that stands out at study relative to reading silently. MacLeod (2011) (I said, you said: The production effect gets personal. <em>Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review</em>, <em>18</em>, 1197–1202. doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-011-0168-8">10.3758/s13423-011-0168-8</a>) found superior memory for reading aloud oneself vs. hearing another person read aloud, which suggests that motor information (speaking), self-referential information (i.e., “<em>I</em> said it”), or both contribute to the production effect. In the present experiment, we dissociated the influence on memory of these two components by including a study condition in which participants heard themselves read words aloud (recorded earlier) – a first for production effect research – along with the more typical study conditions of reading aloud, hearing someone else speak, and reading silently. There was a gradient of memory across these four conditions, with hearing oneself lying between speaking and hearing someone else speak. These results imply that oral production is beneficial because it entails two distinctive components: a motor (speech) act and a unique, self-referential auditory input.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most crimes have multiple eyewitnesses. The police typically interview co-witnesses separately. In time-sensitive investigations, this could slow down evidence accumulation. Having co-witnesses collaboratively recall a crime could potentially expedite evidence accumulation. However, past research shows that collaborative group members often have conflicting retrieval strategies that disrupt each other, degrading overall recall. This cost could potentially be overcome by aligning group members’ retrieval strategies with category clustering recall (CCR), which is a retrieval strategy where information is recalled from a series of forensically relevant categories (e.g., recalling the protagonists’ appearance, then actions). This study examined the costs and benefits of collaborative eyewitness memory by having collaborative pairs of strangers, nominal pairs (i.e., two individuals whose recall is pooled) and lone individuals watch a crime and recall it using free recall or CCR. The collaborative pairs recalled the crime faster than the nominal pairs. They also recalled more correct information than individuals but less than nominal pairs, irrespective of the retrieval method. There is therefore a speed-recall completeness trade-off when collaborative groups recall crimes. Importantly, all participants recalled more correct information when using CCR. This provides initial evidence suggesting that CCR is superior to free recall. Further research examining CCR’s benefits is recommended.</li>

<li>Studies have shown that generating errors prior to studying information (<em>pencil</em>–?) can improve target retention relative to passive (i.e., errorless) study, provided that cues and targets are semantically related (<em>pencil</em>–<em>ink</em>) and not unrelated (<em>pencil-frog</em>). In two experiments, we manipulated semantic proximity of errors to targets during trial-and-error to examine whether it would modulate this error generation benefit. In Experiment 1, participants were shown a cue (<em>band</em>–<em>?</em>) and asked to generate a related word (e.g., <em>drum</em>). Critically, they were given a target that either matched the semantic meaning of their guess (<em>guitar</em>) or mismatched it (<em>rubber</em>). In Experiment 2, participants studied Spanish words where the English translation either matched their expectations (<em>pariente</em>–<em>relative</em>) or mismatched it (<em>carpeta</em>–<em>folder</em>). Both experiments show that errors benefit memory to the extent that they overlap semantically with targets. Results are discussed in terms of the retrieval benefits of activating related concepts during learning.</li>

<ul>
<li>Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive ‘limitations’ arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.</li>

<li>During genome replication, parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). It remains unknown whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly. Here, we measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA strands with a weak leading strand bias, skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading strand increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism for how symmetric cell division is ensured by the replication machinery.</li>

<p>The research shows the frequency and difficulty of questions can reverse the effect and be detrimental to learning. It also is not enough to simply ask a question; Chan says students must respond to see a positive effect on learning.</p>
<p>“Frequency is a critical factor. There appears to be a trade-off in how often you test students,” Chan said. “If I lecture nonstop throughout class, this lessens their ability to learn the material. However, too many questions, too often, can have a detrimental effect, but we don’t yet know exactly why that happens or how many questions is too many.”</p>
<p>The answer to that question may depend on the length of the lecture and the type or difficulty of the material, Chan said. Given the different dynamics of a class lecture, it may not be possible to develop a universal lecture-to-question ratio. Regardless, Chan says testing students throughout the lecture is a simple step instructors at any level and in any environment can apply to help students learn.</p>
<p>“This is a cheap, effective method and anyone can implement it in their class,” he said. “You don’t need to give every student an iPad or buy some fancy software — you just need to ask questions and have students answer them in class.”</p>
<p>Chan, Christian Meissner, a professor of psychology at Iowa State; and Sara Davis, a postdoctoral fellow at Skidmore College and former ISU graduate student, examined journal articles from the 1970s to 2016 detailing more than 150 different experiments for their analysis. The researchers looked at what factors influenced the magnitude of this effect, when it happens and when the effect is reversed.</p>
<p>There are several explanations as to why testing students is beneficial for new learning. The researchers evaluated four main theories for the meta-analysis to examine the strengths and weakness of these explanations from the existing research. The data strongly supported what researchers called the <em>integration theory</em>.</p>
<p>“This theory claims that testing enhances future learning by facilitating the association between information on the test and new, especially related, information that is subsequently studied, leading to spontaneous recall of the previously tested information when they learn related information,” Meissner said. “When this testing occurs, people can better tie new information with what they have learned previously, leading them to integrate the old and the new.”</p>
<p>Learning new information requires an encoding process, which is different from the process needed to retrieve that information, the researchers explained. Students are forced to switch between the two when responding to a question. <em>Changing the modes of operation appears to refocus attention and free the brain to do something different.</em></p>
<p>A majority of the studies in the analysis focused on college students, but some also included older adults, children and people with traumatic brain injuries. The researchers were encouraged to find that testing could effectively enhance learning across all these groups.</p>
<p>“Memory retrieval can optimize learning in situations that require people to maintain attention for an extended period of time. It can be used in class lectures as well as employee training sessions or online webinars,” Davis said. “Future research could examine factors that can maximize this potential.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> A growing body of research has shown that retrieval can enhance future learning of new materials. In the present report, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this finding, which we term test-potentiated new learning. Our primary objectives were to (a) produce an integrative review of the existing theoretical explanations, (b) summarize the extant empirical data with a meta-analysis, (c) evaluate the existing accounts with the meta-analytic results, and (d) highlight areas that deserve further investigations. Here, we identified four nonexclusive classes of theoretical accounts, including resource accounts, metacognitive accounts, context accounts, and integration accounts. Our quantitative review of the literature showed that testing reliably potentiates the future learning of new materials by increasing correct recall or by reducing erroneous intrusions, and several factors have a powerful impact on whether testing potentiates or impairs new learning. Results of a metaregression analysis provide considerable support for the integration account. Lastly, we discuss areas of under-investigation and possible directions for future research.</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to find one’s way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment. Its key unit is the ‘grid cell’, which is activated whenever the animal’s position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.</li>

<li>The question of how many of our perceptual experiences are stored in long-term memory has received considerable attention. The present study examined long-term memory for haptic experiences. Blindfolded participants haptically explored 168 everyday objects (e.g., a pen) for 10 s each. In a blindfolded memory test, they indicated which of two objects from the same basic-level category (e.g., two different pens) had been touched before. As shown in Experiment 1 (<em>N</em> = 26), memory was nearly perfect when tested immediately after exploration (94%) and still high when tested after 1 week (85%). As shown in Experiment 2 (<em>N</em> = 43), when participants explored the objects without the intention to memorize them, memory in a 1-week delayed surprise test was still high (79%), even when assessed with a cross-modal visual memory test (73%). These results indicate that detailed, durable, long-term memory representations are stored as a natural product of haptic perception.</li>

<p>a mental addressing system for chunks<br />
<em>decoding hierarchical control of sequential behavior in oscillatory eeg activity</em><br />

<p>In the study, electrical activity and oscillation patterns were measured by electroencephalogram, with electrodes on the scalp from 88 study participants, all university students, while they performed complex, sequential patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Basic elements -- the alphabet of any type of performance -- need to be combined in a certain order within larger chunks, and these chunks, in turn, need to be combined in a certain order to arrive at the complete sequence,&quot; said Mayr, who directs the UO's Cognitive Dynamics Lab. &quot;This is at the heart of a lot of human creativity.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if you are playing a piece on the piano, your brain needs to keep track in which larger musical phrase, which bar, and which exact note you are currently at,&quot; he said. &quot;So, you need a kind of mental addressing system. It is this addressing system that we discovered with our EEG methods.&quot;</p>
<p>Subjects memorized sequential patterns that consisted of three different angles of lines as basic elements. When participants subsequently tried to reconstruct the succession of lines, the EEG showed oscillatory patterns that Kikumoto and Mayr decoded using machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>It turns out that the EEG patterns kept track of the precise location within the sequence -- which chunk, which position within the chunk, and which line angle people were focusing on.</p>
<p>The findings from the basic research help to understand why some people have difficulties with executing complex sequential plans, Mayr said.</p>
<p>Within the hierarchically organized addressing system, not everyone showed a robust EEG expression of the more abstract levels, he said. Only people with strong working memory scores -- a reflection of the capacity of an individual's mental workspace -- seemed to have a crisp record of the current chunk.</p>
<p>&quot;Without the chunk information they literally got lost within the mental landscape of the overall sequence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>EEG allowed the researchers to capture electrical signaling in the brain in real time. Mayr and Kikumoto are now working to complement the findings with magnetic resonance imaging to document exactly where in the brain the sequential addressing system is localized.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Despite strong theoretical reasons for assuming that abstract representations organize complex action sequences in terms of subplans (chunks) and sequential positions, we lack methods to directly track such content-independent, hierarchical representations in humans. We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity coded basic elements and abstract control representations, in particular, the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillatory activity we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.</p>

<p><em>decoding european palaeolithic art: extremely ancient knowledge of precession of the equinoxes</em><br />
martin b. sweatman, alistair coombs 2018<br />

<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> A consistent interpretation is provided for Neolithic Gobekli Tepe and Catalhoyuk as well as European Palaeolithic cave art. It appears they all display the same method for recording dates based on precession of the equinoxes, with animal symbols representing an ancient zodiac. The same constellations are used today in the West, although some of the zodiacal symbols are different. In particular, the Shaft Scene at Lascaux is found to have a similar meaning to the Vulture Stone at Gobekli Tepe. Both can be viewed as memorials of catastrophic encounters with the Taurid meteor stream, consistent with Clube and Napier’s theory of coherent catastrophism. The date of the likely comet strike recorded at Lascaux is 15,150 BC to within 200 years, corresponding closely to the onset of a climate event recorded in a Greenland ice core. A survey of radiocarbon dates from Chauvet and other Palaeolithic caves is consistent with this zodiacal interpretation, with a very high level of statistical significance. Finally, the Lion Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel, circa 38,000 BC, is also consistent with this interpretation, indicating this knowledge is extremely ancient and was widespread.</li>

<li>auditory recall
<ul>
<li>compare to jenny's memory, mine is quite sparse. now before I read research on non-western time-consciousness, and diana deutch's perfect pitch in tonal language speakers research, I wrote this off as faulty memory.</li>
<li>now however, in light of this research, we can positively review this.</li>
<li>firstly, if, as some recent research concludes, some people (confirmed mainly in non-western people) live more in the present than others, and given this, do not reprocess their long-term memories (and/or future plans) as much as others, then those memories should be correspondingly weaker. this seems to be the case in my memory.</li>
<li>interestingly, I do have some strong memories and they tend to be auditory-linked. while I may not be a typical subject in terms of diana's previous research (I.e. am not musically trained before age 5 nor fully native speaker of tonal language before age 5), it does point to a strong auditory influence in an otherwise sparse long-term memory.</li>
<li>interesting questions for further research might be, &quot;is (long-term) auditory memory stronger in speakers of tonal languages (than non-auditory memory and/or speakers of non-tonal languages?&quot; and &quot;what effect, if any, does a non-western experience of time have on (long-term) memory, and what effect, if any, does speaking a tonal language have on this?&quot;</li>
<li>do people specialise in certain ways (for example, music, memory) because of the way in which their recall systems are primed? by what means does this priming occur and what results from it?</li>

<li>often solutions come to me in the middle of the night, to problems that I didn't even know I was thinking about — this is when it is especially handy to have a system ready to take notes, ready to go at a moment's notice, so that you can catch the idea, set it down to retrieve it later</li>

<li>if we don't have a word or label for something, does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?
<ul>
<li>if we do not have the concept of grey or greyish (some cultures do not, it seems) does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?</li>
<li>if we are taught that “foreigners are the enemy” but haven’t learned what an “oligarch” or an “abuser” is, who would we fight for or against?</li>
<li>we may know that we are being manipulated by the media and their handlers, but that is not the same as being able to do something about what we are immersed in, and how that effects our actions and beliefs — our culture effects us deeply in ways we don't understand, that we barely have the language or means to describe.</li>
<li>liberals might congratulate themselves on understanding great chunks of reality that conservatives do not deal with, like climate change, racism, sexism — but there are whole mountains, continents of reality out there, of abuse and responsibility, with people already living there and willing to share, and someday we too will learn how</li>

<li>study for recall
<ul>
<li>if generalise principle of studying–as–if–you–were–recalling helps performance, then we should not be studying as if for academic tests, as tests are rarely like recall situations in real life.</li>
<li>I want to learn and share the learning and to make notes efficiently as I go along reading, but I am also aware that this can sometimes get in the way of actually learning. for example it would be a good idea from the efficiency point of view, to write a mind map of each book as I read it, making each major section of the map the question that each section of the book tries to answer.</li>

<li>memory embellishment
<ul>
<li>it might be that i don't have a sparse memory — other people have memory embellishment that i lack. i seem to preserve and recall basic memories that are not embellished on recall, like a lot of people do</li>
<li>94% US professors believe they are “above average” as professors — study is not only wrong because of bias in selection, but if it were correct, up to 50% of respondents could actually be correct — what about them? it's all very well saying some are mistaken, but what about those who are correct?</li>
<li>false memories are part of our memory system — everyone has them and they are not an aberration. understanding this may improve relationships and influence our recall strategies</li>
<li>a lot of people seem to use narrative, but i seem to do this much less than most. for example, my memory and identity do not seem to be as strongly narrative–based as others are.</li>
<li>my memory is procedural, it excels at recalling procedures and paths. others have an episodic memory.</li>
