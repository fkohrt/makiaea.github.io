<p><em>biased sequential sampling underlies the effects of time pressure and delay in social decision making</em><br />
fadong chen, ian krajbich 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05994-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05994-9</a></p>

<li>Social decision making involves balancing conflicts between selfishness and pro-sociality. The cognitive processes underlying such decisions are not well understood, with some arguing for a single comparison process, while others argue for dual processes (one intuitive and one deliberative). Here, we propose a way to reconcile these two opposing frameworks. We argue that behavior attributed to intuition can instead be seen as a starting point bias of a sequential sampling model (SSM) process, analogous to a prior in a Bayesian framework. Using mini-dictator games in which subjects make binary decisions about how to allocate money between themselves and another participant, we find that pro-social subjects become more pro-social under time pressure and less pro-social under time delay, while selfish subjects do the opposite. Our findings help reconcile the conflicting results concerning the cognitive processes of social decision making and highlight the importance of modeling the dynamics of the choice process.</li>

<p><em>time of day differences in neural reward functioning in healthy young men</em><br />

<li>Reward function appears to be modulated by the circadian system, but little is known about the neural basis of this interaction. Previous research suggests that the neural reward response may be different in the afternoon; however, the direction of this effect is contentious. Reward response may follow the diurnal rhythm in self-reported positive affect, peaking in the early afternoon. An alternative is that daily reward response represents a type of prediction error, with neural reward activation relatively high at times of day when rewards are unexpected (i.e., early and late in the day). The present study measured neural reward activation in the context of a validated reward task at 10.00 h, 14.00 h, and 19.00 h in healthy human males. A region of interest BOLD fMRI protocol was used to investigate the diurnal waveform of activation in reward-related brain regions. Multilevel modeling found, as expected, a highly significant quadratic time-of-day effect focusing on the left putamen (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Consistent with the “prediction error” hypothesis, activation was significantly higher at 10.00 h and 19.00 h compared with 14.00 h. It is provisionally concluded that the putamen may be particularly important in endogenous priming of reward motivation at different times of day, with the pattern of activation consistent with circadian-modulated reward expectancies in neural pathways (i.e., greater activation to reward stimuli at unexpected times of day). This study encourages further research into circadian modulation of reward and underscores the methodological importance of accounting for time of day in fMRI protocols.</li>

<li>Diurnal gene expression patterns underlie time of the day-specific functional specialization of tissues. However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate <em>Papio anubis</em> (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most of ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk with a “quiescent period” during early night. Our findings also unveil a different temporal organization of central and peripheral tissues between diurnal and nocturnal animals.</li>

<p><em>double dissociation of single-interval and rhythmic temporal prediction in cerebellar degeneration and parkinson’s disease</em><br />

<p>One type relies on memories from past experiences. The other on rhythm. Both are critical to our ability to navigate and enjoy the world.<br />
New University of California, Berkeley, research shows the neural networks supporting each of these timekeepers are split between two different parts of the brain, depending on the task at hand.<br />
“Whether it’s sports, music, speech or even allocating attention, our study suggests that timing is not a unified process, but that there are two distinct ways in which we make temporal predictions and these depend on different parts of the brain,” said study lead author Assaf Breska, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at UC Berkeley.<br />
The findings, published online in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> journal, offer a new perspective on how humans calculate when to make a move.<br />
“Together, these brain systems allow us to not just exist in the moment, but to also actively anticipate the future,” said study senior author Richard Ivry, a UC Berkeley neuroscientist.<br />
Breska and Ivry studied the anticipatory timing strengths and deficits of people with Parkinson’s disease and people with cerebellar degeneration.<br />
They connected rhythmic timing to the basal ganglia, and interval timing — an internal timer based largely on our memory of prior experiences — to the cerebellum. Both are primal brain regions associated with movement and cognition.<br />
Moreover, their results suggest that if one of these neural clocks is misfiring, the other could theoretically step in.<br />
“Our study identifies not only the anticipatory contexts in which these neurological patients are impaired, but also the contexts in which they have no difficulty, suggesting we could modify their environments to make it easier for them to interact with the world in face of their symptoms,” Breska said.<br />
Non-pharmaceutical fixes for neurological timing deficits could include brain-training computer games and smartphone apps, deep brain stimulation and environmental design modifications, he said.<br />
To arrive at their conclusion, Breska and Ivry compared how well Parkinson’s and cerebellar degeneration patients used timing or “temporal” cues to focus their attention.<br />
Both groups viewed sequences of red, white and green squares as they flashed by at varying speeds on a computer screen, and pushed a button the moment they saw the green square. The white squares alerted them that the green square was coming up.<br />
In one sequence, the red, white and green squares followed a steady rhythm, and the cerebellar degeneration patients responded well to these rhythmic cues.<br />
In another, the colored squares followed a more complex pattern, with differing intervals between the red and green squares. This sequence was easier for the Parkinson’s patients to follow, and succeed at.<br />
“We show that patients with cerebellar degeneration are impaired in using non-rhythmic temporal cues while patients with basal ganglia degeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease are impaired in using rhythmic cues,” Ivry said.<br />
Ultimately, the results confirm that the brain uses two different mechanisms for anticipatory timing, challenging theories that a single brain system handles all our timing needs, researchers said.<br />
“Our results suggest at least two different ways in which the brain has evolved to anticipate the future,” said Breska.<br />
“A rhythm-based system is sensitive to periodic events in the world such as is inherent in speech and music,” he added. “And an interval system provides a more general anticipatory ability, sensitive to temporal regularities even in the absence of a rhythmic signal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Predicting the timing of upcoming events is critical for successful interaction in a dynamic world, and is recognized as a key computation for attentional orienting. Temporal predictions can be formed when recent events define a rhythmic structure, as well as in aperiodic streams or even in isolation, when a specified interval is known from previous exposure. However, whether predictions in these two contexts are mediated by a common mechanism, or by distinct, context-dependent mechanisms, is highly controversial. Moreover, although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been linked to temporal processing, the role of these subcortical structures in temporal orienting of attention is unclear. To address these issues, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration or Parkinson’s disease, with the latter serving as a model of basal ganglia dysfunction, on temporal prediction tasks in the subsecond range. The participants performed a visual detection task in which the onset of the target was predictable, based on either a rhythmic stream of stimuli, or a single interval, specified by two events that occurred within an aperiodic stream. Patients with cerebellar degeneration showed no benefit from single-interval cuing but preserved benefit from rhythm cuing, whereas patients with Parkinson’s disease showed no benefit from rhythm cuing but preserved benefit from single-interval cuing. This double dissociation provides causal evidence for functionally nonoverlapping mechanisms of rhythm- and interval-based temporal prediction for attentional orienting, and establishes the separable contributions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia to these functions, suggesting a mechanistic specialization across timing domains.</p>

<p><em>evidence for the incorporation of temporal duration information in human hippocampal long-term memory sequence representations</em><br />
sathesan thavabalasingam et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1819993116">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1819993116</a></p>

<p>builds on a 2011 study on rodents that found so-called 'time cells' in the hippocampus. These cells were shown to fire during the empty delay in-between two separate events, signaling the passage of time in the order of seconds. The idea is that these cells help bind together information about time when forming a memory.</p>
<p>Lee and his team, including PhD candidate Sathesan Thavabalasingam and postdoc Edward O'Neil, wanted to see if a similar mechanism exists in the human hippocampus that helps integrate time information when memories are being formed.</p>
<p>To test this, 18 participants were asked to learn four short sequences or &quot;memories&quot; that differed in image content and duration between each event. During fMRI, a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity based on blood flow, they were asked to complete a recognition memory task and then mentally replay each sequence in as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>The researchers found that brain activity patterns in the anterior hippocampus reflected the duration of the empty periods in-between events, complementing what was found in the rodent study.</p>
<p>&quot;This study bridges a gap with the rodent study to show that our hippocampus is interested in time information in the order of seconds during long-term memory processing,&quot; says Thavabalasingam, who along with O'Neil are first authors on the study.</p>
<p>It's important to understand the mechanics of how time information is processed in the brain since it's one of several significant dimensions involved in forming long-term memories, adds Thavabalasingam.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't have a memory of an event without having some sort of experience of how long it took place. It's important to better understand how the brain processes the entire timeline of an experience, and how that's being represented in long-term memories,&quot; he says</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We demonstrate that multivariate patterns of activity in the human hippocampus during the recognition and cued mental replay of long-term sequence memories contain temporal structure information in the order of seconds. By using an experimental paradigm that required participants to remember the durations of empty intervals between visually presented scene images, our study provides evidence that the human hippocampus can represent elapsed time within a sequence of events in conjunction with other forms of information, such as event content. Our findings complement rodent studies that have shown that hippocampal neurons fire at specific times during the empty delay between two events and suggest a common hippocampal neural mechanism for representing temporal information in the service of episodic memory.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>There has been much interest in how the hippocampus codes time in support of episodic memory. Notably, while rodent hippocampal neurons, including populations in subfield CA1, have been shown to represent the passage of time in the order of seconds between events, there is limited support for a similar mechanism in humans. Specifically, there is no clear evidence that human hippocampal activity during long-term memory processing is sensitive to temporal duration information that spans seconds. To address this gap, we asked participants to first learn short event sequences that varied in image content and interval durations. During fMRI, participants then completed a recognition memory task, as well as a recall phase in which they were required to mentally replay each sequence in as much detail as possible. We found that individual sequences could be classified using activity patterns in the anterior hippocampus during recognition memory. Critically, successful classification was dependent on the conjunction of event content and temporal structure information (with unsuccessful classification of image content or interval duration alone), and further analyses suggested that the most informative voxels resided in the anterior CA1. Additionally, a classifier trained on anterior CA1 recognition data could successfully identify individual sequences from the mental replay data, suggesting that similar activity patterns supported participants’ recognition and recall memory. Our findings complement recent rodent hippocampal research, and provide evidence that long-term sequence memory representations in the human hippocampus can reflect duration information in the order of seconds.</p>

<p><em>why the days seem shorter as we get older</em><br />
adrian bejan 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1062798718000741">http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1062798718000741</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,&quot; said Bejan. &quot;It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Bejan attributes this phenomenon to physical changes in the aging human body. As tangled webs of nerves and neurons mature, they grow in size and complexity, leading to longer paths for signals to traverse. As those paths then begin to age, they also degrade, giving more resistance to the flow of electrical signals.</p>
<p>These phenomena cause the rate at which new mental images are acquired and processed to decrease with age. This is evidenced by how often the eyes of infants move compared to adults, noted Bejan -- because infants process images faster than adults, their eyes move more often, acquiring and integrating more information.</p>
<p>The end result is that, because older people are viewing fewer new images in the same amount of actual time, it seems to them as though time is passing more quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;The human mind senses time changing when the perceived images change,&quot; said Bejan. &quot;The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings. Days seemed to last longer in your youth because the young mind receives more images during one day than the same mind in old age.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Why does it feel that the time passes faster as we get older? What is the physical basis for the impression that some days are slower than others? Why do we tend to focus on the unusual (the surprise), not on the ever present? This article unveils the physics basis for these common observations. The reason is that the measurable ‘clock time’ is not the same as the time perceived by the human mind. The ‘mind time’ is a sequence of images, i.e. reflections of nature that are fed by stimuli from sensory organs. The rate at which changes in mental images are perceived decreases with age, because of several physical features that change with age: saccades frequency, body size, pathways degradation, etc. The misalignment between mental-image time and clock time serves to unite the voluminous observations of this phenomenon in the literature with the constructal law of evolution of flow architecture, as physics.</p>

<li>Consumers often organize their time by scheduling various tasks, but also leave some time unaccounted. The authors examine whether ending an interval of unaccounted time with an upcoming task systematically alters how this time is perceived and consumed. Eight studies conducted both in the lab and field show that bounded intervals of time (e.g., an hour before a scheduled meeting) feel prospectively shorter than unbounded intervals of time (e.g., an hour with nothing scheduled subsequently). Furthermore, consumers perform fewer tasks and are less likely to engage in relatively extended (though feasible) tasks during a bounded compared to an unbounded interval of time – even in the face of financial incentives. Finally, making a longer task easier to separate into subparts attenuates this effect.</li>

<p>study involved 18 females and 13 males with normal vision and no sensory, musculoskeletal or neurological disorders. The researchers used a virtual reality game, Robo Recall, to create a natural setting in which to encourage re-calibration of time perception. The key manipulation of the study was that the researchers coupled the speed and duration of visual events to the participant's body movements.</p>
<p>The researchers measured participants' time perception abilities before and after they were exposed to the dynamic VR task. Some participants also completed non-VR time-perception tasks, such as throwing a ball, to use as a control comparison.</p>
<p>The researchers measured the actual and perceived durations of a moving probe in the time perception tasks. They discovered that the virtual reality manipulation was associated with significant reductions in the participants' estimates of time, by around 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This study adds valuable proof that the perception of time is flexible, and that VR offers a potentially valuable tool for recalibrating time in the brain,&quot; says Weech. &quot;It offers a compelling application for rehabilitation initiatives that focus on how time perception breaks down in certain populations.&quot;</p>
<p>Weech adds, however, that while the effects were strong during the current study, more research is needed to find out how long the effects last, and whether these signals are observable in the brain. &quot;For developing clinical applications, we need to know whether these effects are stable for minutes, days, or weeks afterward. A longitudinal study would provide the answer to this question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Virtual reality technology has matured dramatically,&quot; says Michael Barnett-Cowan, neuroscience professor in the Department of Kinesiology and senior author of the paper. &quot;VR now convincingly changes our experience of space and time, enabling basic research in perception to inform our understanding of how the brains of normal, injured, aged and diseased populations work and how they can be treated to perform optimally.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Virtual reality (VR) provides a valuable research tool for studying what occurs when sensorimotor feedback loops are manipulated. Here we measured whether exposure to a novel temporal relationship between action and sensory reaction in VR causes recalibration of time perception. We asked 31 participants to perform time perception tasks where the interval of a moving probe was reproduced using continuous or discrete motor methods. These time perception tasks were completed pre- and post-exposure to dynamic VR content in a block-counterbalanced order. One group of participants experienced a standard VR task (“normal-time”), while another group had their real-world movements coupled to the flow of time in the virtual space (“movement contingent time-flow; MCTF”). We expected this novel action-perception relationship to affect continuous motor time perception performance, but not discrete motor time perception. The results indicated duration-dependent recalibration specific to a motor task involving continuous movement such that the probe intervals were under-estimated by approximately 15% following exposure to VR with the MCTF manipulation. Control tasks in VR and non-VR settings produced similar results to those of the normal-time VR group, confirming the specificity of the MCTF manipulation. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential impact of VR on sensorimotor recalibration. Understanding this process will be valuable for the development and implementation of rehabilitation practices.</p>

<p><em>chronoprints: identifying samples by visualizing how they change over space and time</em><br />

<p>to distinguish authentic from adulterated drugs and food by observing how they behave when disturbed by temperature changes or other causes. Two substances with identical compositions should respond the same way to a disturbance, and if two substances appear identical but respond differently, their composition must be different, they reasoned.</p>
<p>McKenzie designed a set of experiments to test this idea. She loaded samples of pure olive oil, one of the world's most commonly adulterated foods, and cough syrup, which is often diluted or counterfeited in the developing world, into tiny channels on a microfluidic chip, and chilled it quickly in liquid nitrogen. A USB microscope camera filmed the samples reacting to the temperature change.</p>
<p>McKenzie and Grover wrote software that converts the video to a bitmap image. Because the image showed how the sample changed over time, the researchers called it a &quot;chronoprint.&quot;</p>
<p>The team then used image analysis algorithms to compare different chronoprints from the same substance. They found that each pure substance had a reliable chronoprint over multiple tests.</p>
<p>Next, they repeated the experiment with samples of olive oil that had been diluted with other oils and cough syrup diluted with water. The adulterated samples produced chronoprints that were different from the pure samples. The difference was so big, so obvious, and so consistent the researchers concluded that chronoprints and image analysis algorithms can reliably detect some types of food and drug fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;The significant visual differences between the samples were both unexpected and exciting, and with them being consistent we knew this could be a useful way to identify a wide range of samples,&quot; McKenzie said.</p>
<p>Grover said their technique creates a powerful new connection between chemistry and computer science.</p>
<p>&quot;By basically converting a chemical sample to an image, we can take advantage of all the different image analysis algorithms that computer scientists have developed,&quot; he said. &quot;And as those algorithms get better, our ability to chemically identify a sample should get better, too.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers used liquids in their experiments but note the method could also be used on solid materials dissolved in water, and other types of disturbance, such as heat or a centrifuge, could be used for substances that don't react well to freezing. The technique is easy to learn, making highly trained experts unnecessary. Chronoprinting requires hobbyist-grade equipment and software downloadable for free from Grover's lab website, putting it well within reach of government agencies and labs with limited resources.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The modern tools of chemistry excel at identifying a sample, but the cost, size, complexity, and power consumption of these instruments often preclude their use in resource-limited settings. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and low-cost method for identifying a sample based on visualizing how the sample changes over space and time in response to a perturbation. Different types of perturbations could be used, and in this proof-of-concept we use a dynamic temperature gradient that rapidly cools different parts of the sample at different rates. We accomplish this by first loading several samples into long parallel channels on a “microfluidic thermometer chip.” We then immerse one end of the chip in liquid nitrogen to create a dynamic temperature gradient along the channels, and we use an inexpensive USB microscope to record a video of how the samples respond to the changing temperature gradient. The video is then converted into several bitmap images (one per sample) that capture each sample’s response to the perturbation in both space (the y-axis; the distance along the dynamic temperature gradient) and time (the x-axis); we call these images “chronological fingerprints” or “chronoprints” of each sample. If two samples’ chronoprints are similar, this suggests that the samples are the same chemical substance or mixture, but if two samples’ chronoprints are significantly different, this proves that the samples are chemically different. Since chronoprints are just bitmap images, they can be compared using a variety of techniques from computer science, and in this work we use three different image comparison algorithms to quantify chronoprint similarity. As a demonstration of the versatility of chronoprints, we use them in three different applications: distinguishing authentic olive oil from adulterated oil (an example of the over $10 billion global problem of food fraud), identifying adulterated or counterfeit medication (which represents around 10% of all medication in low- and middle-income countries), and distinguishing the occasionally confused pharmaceutical ingredients glycerol and diethylene glycol (whose accidental or intentional substitution has led to hundreds of deaths). The simplicity and versatility of chronoprints should make them valuable analytical tools in a variety of different fields.<br />
A simple and low-cost method is reported for identifying a sample based on visualizing how the sample changes over space and time in response to a perturbation.</p>

<li>People’s welfare is a function of both time and money. People can – and, it is said, increasingly do – suffer time-poverty as well as money-poverty. It is undeniably true that people feel increasingly time pressured, particularly in dual- earner households. But much of the time devoted to paid and unpaid tasks is over and above that which is strictly necessary. In that sense, much of the time pressure that people feel is discretionary and of their own making. Using data from the 1992 Australian Time Use Survey, this paper demonstrates that the magnitude of this ‘time-pressure illusion’ varies across population groups, being least among lone parents and greatest among the childless and two-earner couples.</li>

Using the analogy of crystals in space, the breaking of translational symmetry in time and the emergence of a ‘time crystal’ was recently proposed<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref2">5</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref3">6</a>, but was later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref4">7</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref5">8</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref6">9</a>. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems, which are subject to a periodic drive, can exhibit persistent time correlations at an emergent subharmonic frequency<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref7">10</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref8">11</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref9">12</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref10">13</a>. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a ‘discrete time crystal’<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref10">13</a>. Here we present the experimental observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization conditions, and observe a subharmonic temporal response that is robust to external perturbations. The observation of such a time crystal opens the door to the study of systems with long-range spatio-temporal correlations and novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref7">10</a>.</li>

<p><em>identifying cis elements for spatiotemporal control of mammalian dna replication</em><br />

<p>Gilbert and Sima examined a single segment of the DNA in the highest possible 3D resolution and saw three sequences along the DNA molecule touching each other frequently. The researchers then used CRISPR, a sophisticated gene editing technology, to remove these three areas simultaneously.</p>
<p>And with that, they found that these three elements together were the key to DNA replication.</p>
<p>&quot;Removing these elements shifted the segment's replication time from the very beginning to the very end of the process,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;This was one of those moments where just one result knocks your socks off.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the effect on replication timing, the removal of the three elements caused the 3D structure of the DNA molecule to change dramatically.</p>
<p>&quot;We have for the first time pinpointed specific DNA sequences in the genome that regulate chromatin structure and replication timing,&quot; Sima said. &quot;These results reflect one possible model of how DNA folds inside cells and how these folding patterns could impact the hereditary materials' function.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing [RT]) is highly coupled with genome architecture, but cis-elements regulating either remain elusive. We created a series of CRISPR-mediated deletions and inversions of a pluripotency-associated topologically associating domain (TAD) in mouse ESCs. CTCF-associated domain boundaries were dispensable for RT. CTCF protein depletion weakened most TAD boundaries but had no effect on RT or A/B compartmentalization genome-wide. By contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites caused a domain-wide early-to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The dispensability of TAD boundaries and the necessity of these “early replication control elements” (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and inversions at additional domains. Our results demonstrate that discrete cis-regulatory elements orchestrate domain-wide RT, A/B compartmentalization, TAD architecture, and transcription, revealing fundamental principles linking genome structure and function.</p>

<li>When determining responsibility for harmful actions, people often consider whether the actor behaved intentionally. The spread of surveillance cameras, “on-officer” recording devices, and smart-phone video makes it increasingly likely that such judgments are aided by video replay. Yet, little is known about how different qualities of the video, such as replay speed, affect human judgment. We demonstrate that slow motion replay can systematically increase judgments of intent because it gives viewers the false impression that the actor had more time to premeditate before acting. In legal proceedings, these judgments of intent can mean the difference between life and death. Thus, any benefits of video replay should be weighed against its potentially biasing effects.</li>

<p><em>stratigraphic signatures of mass extinctions: ecological and sedimentary determinants</em><br />
rafał nawrot et al. 2018<br />

<p>Florida Museum of Natural History researchers used a series of 130-foot cores drilled from the Po Plain in northeastern Italy to test a thought experiment: Imagine catastrophe strikes the Adriatic Sea, swiftly wiping out modern marine life. Could this hypothetical mass extinction be reconstructed correctly from mollusks — hard-shelled animals such as oysters and mussels — preserved in these cores?<br />
When they examined the cores, the results were “somewhat unnerving,” said Michal Kowalewski, Thompson Chair of Invertebrate Paleontology and the study’s principal investigator.<br />
Paleontologists use the age of a species’ last-known fossil to estimate the timing of extinction. A sudden extinction in the Adriatic Sea today should leave the youngest remains of many mollusk species in the sediments currently forming on the shore and seabed, the “ground zero” of the hypothetical extinction event. But the team found only six of 119 mollusk species — all of which are still alive in the area — at the top of the cores. Instead, the last fossil examples of many of these species often appeared in clusters dotted throughout the cores, suggesting smaller bursts of extinctions over a longer timeline, not a single massive die-off.<br />
Taken at face value, the cores presented a dramatically distorted record of both the timing and tempo of extinction, potentially calling into question some of the methods paleontologists commonly use to interpret past mass extinctions.<br />
“We’re not saying you cannot study mass extinctions. You can,” Kowalewski said. “What we’re saying is that the nature of the geological record is complicated, so it is not trivial to decipher it correctly.”<br />
The results of their analysis did not come as a complete surprise. Computer models designed by paleontologists Steven Holland and Mark Patzkowsky had made similar predictions about how the final resting place of fossils — influenced by species’ ecological preferences, sea level and the makeup of sedimentary basins — could skew patterns of mass extinction.<br />
“This is, to my knowledge, the first empirical study to use the fossil record of living species to test these models rigorously and computationally, rather than theoretically,” Kowalewski said. “We know these species are still living in the Adriatic Sea, so we can be sure that their disappearance from the fossil record does not represent a true extinction.”<br />
Paleontologists have been grappling with the complications of interpreting mass extinctions in the fossil record for several decades. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs was thought to be a gradual, drawn-out process until evidence of a lethal meteor impact emerged in 1980. The problem is a phenomenon known as the Signor-Lipps effect: Because the fossil record is incompletely sampled, the last-known fossil of a given species is almost certainly not the last member of that species, which muddles our ability to date extinctions.<br />
Applied on a larger scale, the Signor-Lipps effect can make abrupt mass extinctions appear gradual. A common approach to correct for this effect is to assume that where fossils end up — and are later discovered — is random, and mathematically adjust estimates of extinction timing accordingly.<br />
But it’s more complicated than that, Kowalewski said, because the fossil record is not created in a random way.<br />
Climatic cycles trigger changes in sea level, causing shorelines to advance or recede and driving changes in environments. A beach may become a mudflat, for example, or a delta can turn into a coastal plain. Shifts in sea level can also affect sedimentation rates — how quickly mud and sand are deposited. These factors can cause last occurrences of fossils to cluster together and influence the probability of finding fossils in a given location.<br />
When the researchers reordered the species represented in the cores from the Po basin according to their last occurrence, they noted several points at which many species appeared to vanish simultaneously. In reality, none of the species had gone extinct. They disappeared from a given site either because local environmental conditions changed, or they were simply missed during the sampling, said Rafal Nawrot, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral researcher in invertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum.<br />
The cores also depicted a false pattern of extinction, with the majority of offshore species disappearing in a single large “pulse” in the lower part of the cores and shallow-water and brackish species fading out in several smaller pulses. This is because species followed their preferred habitats as they shifted with changing sea levels. Deeper-water dwellers vanished first, as the local river delta started to expand into the Adriatic Sea, replacing open sea with coastal conditions. When shorelines advanced even farther, shallow-water species disappeared as well.<br />
“It’s important to admit that fossil species — just like modern ones — have specific ecological requirements, which sounds obvious but is not always acknowledged,” Nawrot said.<br />
Current methods may give researchers the illusion of precision but fail to account for these factors, which are crucial to correctly interpreting past extinction events, he said.<br />
“If you apply methods based on the assumption of random fossilization, you get a precise estimate, but it may be wrong by millions of years,” Nawrot said. “Not only the pattern of extinction but also the timing of extinction would be wrongly interpreted, so this is quite important.”<br />
While the findings are sobering, the situation is far from hopeless, Kowalewski said. When the team incorporated methods that accounted for species’ ecological preferences, distribution and abundance into the analysis, the results were a much closer approximation of what exists in the basin today.<br />
“This provides us with an initial guideline of how to analyze these types of data to get a more realistic assessment of extinction events,” Kowalewski said. “Certainly, this is a work in progress.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> stratigraphic patterns of last occurrences (LOs) of fossil taxa potentially fingerprint mass extinctions and delineate rates and geometries of those events. Although empirical studies of mass extinctions recognize that random sampling causes LOs to occur earlier than the time of extinction (Signor–Lipps effect), sequence stratigraphic controls on the position of LOs are rarely considered. By tracing stratigraphic ranges of extant mollusc species preserved in the Holocene succession of the Po coastal plain (Italy), we demonstrated that, if mass extinction took place today, complex but entirely false extinction patterns would be recorded regionally due to shifts in local community composition and non-random variation in the abundance of skeletal remains, both controlled by relative sea-level changes. Consequently, rather than following an apparent gradual pattern expected from the Signor–Lipps effect, LOs concentrated within intervals of stratigraphic condensation and strong facies shifts mimicking sudden extinction pulses. Methods assuming uniform recovery potential of fossils falsely supported stepwise extinction patterns among studied species and systematically underestimated their stratigraphic ranges. Such effects of stratigraphic architecture, co-produced by ecological, sedimentary and taphonomic processes, can easily confound interpretations of the timing, duration and selectivity of mass extinction events. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic context when inferring extinction dynamics from the fossil record.</p>

<li>the limiting factor in this age is time. we need to deal with the consequences of our ancestors’ actions, and we need to do it fast. change has come in the past when those people who hold power who also hold opinions that are no longer suited to the world–as–it–is pass on that power to a new generation. unfortunately the consequences this time are so huge that it is irresponsible to wait many years for that change to come to pass. the problem is compounded not only by the magnitude of the consequences — damage to the entirety of the earth — but also by the longevity of the people in power — longer than in living memory — and the concentration of that power — more concentrated than in living memory.
<ul>
<li>to achieve this goal it is not necessary to aim for perfection. the tale of the hundredth monkey illustrates this: “there was once a land which had been poisoned by humans, and they wanted to learn how long it would take for life to cover the land once more. ten thousand monkey were made to settle on the land, which bore coconut by the time the ten thousand monkey were settled. however the coconut also bore the poison on their outer husk so that a nut must be first washed in the river afore it were eaten. so they tried to teach the monkey to wash the coconut, and sure enough, at the end of the first day, one little monkey had learned to wash the coconut. at the end of the second day, another two monkey had learned to wash the coconut. and so it continued that each day more and more monkey learned to wash the coconut. but something happened they did not expect. one day, after the hundredth monkey had learned to wash the coconut, they came to the river and saw lined upon the bank many thousand monkey washing coconut. and they were sore confused and said, how had this come to pass?”</li>

<li>“Is a person abusive because of a privileged upbringing, or does a privileged upbringing make a person abusive?” is the sort of nice zero–sum assumption question that may be helpful in creating an argument, but is worthless in working towards a solution. The problem is that generalisation of logic leaves out <em>time</em>, and, specifically, <em>change</em>. Both assertions could be true, at certain times, for certain people — and no longer true at other times, for even the same people.</li>

<li>understanding time is not an alternative to the eternal world view, it is the productive, positive part. when we are infants, and when our faculties dissolve near our ends, we have the eternal world view. it does not produce, it can only consume. but in the prime of our lives, we can choose to produce. unfortunately if we are excessively privileged or abused we never grow into our prime and thus know only to destroy.</li>

<li>people often confuse things that apply at a particular time, in a particular context, and believe these are always, universally correct. this is no less true in science as in religion. for example, a scientific study that generalises from several decisions of many individuals, and purports to explain all decisions of individuals, is very likely to be wrong. it may be that some people are open to changing their opinion sometimes, but a study that captures only a few decisions from each individual will not see this.</li>

<li>time is something we mostly take for granted, like space and air. it is something we rarely try to understand, and so it has become one of our greatest weaknesses.
<ul>
<li>for to understand, even a little, of time, means we understand processes, such as life, a little more clearly.</li>
<li>the power of time is much greater than physical power, it can be accumulative.</li>
<li>the reliance on definition comes in part from a misunderstanding of time. it is assumed that something can be permanent, that the concept of permanence is something useful. similarly with perfection, and the concept of limits.</li>
<li>we will be considering practical applications of the concept of time, rather than certain definitions of it.</li>
<li>i don't believe time exists. nonetheless, many people are beholden to time. so i am not going to talk today about time's existence but rather about what we can do about our relationship with time.</li>
<li>because the two fundamental concepts of time and of change are intimately and inseparably related in our culture, to deal with change is to deal with time.</li>
<li>the illusion of time can be likened to the illusion of space. we are familiar with the illusion of three dimensions transmitted through the medium of an essentially two-dimensional surface, be it paper, or a screen, or an electronic device. with a little thought we can imagine our perception of time in the same way, as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional phenomenon.</li>
<li>now why should we bother with this? i used to believe that if time was not an evolutionarily useful concept it would not be so widely used. but contained in that simple-seeming statement are both a fallacy and a trap. firstly, time, in the way that it was perceived by many people in &quot;western&quot; cultures at the end of the twentieth century, is not the same as it is perceived in other human cultures in the present and the past, and perhaps very different to what is perceived by other organisms. secondly, our definition of time is circular, in that we use it in the very definition we give of it. evolution, useful and concept are all dependent on our definition of time, for example.</li>
<li>well, i say to this, even if our words and present concepts are all we have, let us see what we can do with them.</li>

<li>unlike most people, have a less bounded notion of time, which means that respond differently to others when faced with ‘time pressure’ — for example, many people feel they need to achieve something as they near the end of an internally important deadline or time marker, or base opinions on the most recent information rather than the rest of the information available.</li>

<li>our relation to time and an understanding of how to change it</li>
<li>not only how things are, but how things were and will be</li>
<li>to think not only time but also variation over time and variation of the variation over time — three “dimensions” of time</li>
<li>when you expand your mind in this dimension of time, many things become possible, that once seemed impossible.</li>

<li>being sensitive in the present is a kind of power. without as much distraction from thoughts, whether of what we think happened or what we believe will happen, lets us feel what is happening.</li>
<li>this is not some psychic power, it is something all life on earth seems to have, except those of us trampled by an abusive civilisation.</li>
