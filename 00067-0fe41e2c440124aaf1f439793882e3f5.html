<p><em>biased sequential sampling underlies the effects of time pressure and delay in social decision making</em><br />
fadong chen, ian krajbich 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05994-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05994-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Social decision making involves balancing conflicts between selfishness and pro-sociality. The cognitive processes underlying such decisions are not well understood, with some arguing for a single comparison process, while others argue for dual processes (one intuitive and one deliberative). Here, we propose a way to reconcile these two opposing frameworks. We argue that behavior attributed to intuition can instead be seen as a starting point bias of a sequential sampling model (SSM) process, analogous to a prior in a Bayesian framework. Using mini-dictator games in which subjects make binary decisions about how to allocate money between themselves and another participant, we find that pro-social subjects become more pro-social under time pressure and less pro-social under time delay, while selfish subjects do the opposite. Our findings help reconcile the conflicting results concerning the cognitive processes of social decision making and highlight the importance of modeling the dynamics of the choice process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>time pressure increases when we age — we take much longer to make decisions that only required much less time to make when we were younger, ironically leaving less time available for decisions, making us more biased</p>

<p><em>time of day differences in neural reward functioning in healthy young men</em><br />

<li>Reward function appears to be modulated by the circadian system, but little is known about the neural basis of this interaction. Previous research suggests that the neural reward response may be different in the afternoon; however, the direction of this effect is contentious. Reward response may follow the diurnal rhythm in self-reported positive affect, peaking in the early afternoon. An alternative is that daily reward response represents a type of prediction error, with neural reward activation relatively high at times of day when rewards are unexpected (i.e., early and late in the day). The present study measured neural reward activation in the context of a validated reward task at 10.00 h, 14.00 h, and 19.00 h in healthy human males. A region of interest BOLD fMRI protocol was used to investigate the diurnal waveform of activation in reward-related brain regions. Multilevel modeling found, as expected, a highly significant quadratic time-of-day effect focusing on the left putamen (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Consistent with the “prediction error” hypothesis, activation was significantly higher at 10.00 h and 19.00 h compared with 14.00 h. It is provisionally concluded that the putamen may be particularly important in endogenous priming of reward motivation at different times of day, with the pattern of activation consistent with circadian-modulated reward expectancies in neural pathways (i.e., greater activation to reward stimuli at unexpected times of day). This study encourages further research into circadian modulation of reward and underscores the methodological importance of accounting for time of day in fMRI protocols.</li>

<li>Diurnal gene expression patterns underlie time of the day-specific functional specialization of tissues. However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate <em>Papio anubis</em> (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most of ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk with a “quiescent period” during early night. Our findings also unveil a different temporal organization of central and peripheral tissues between diurnal and nocturnal animals.</li>

<p>Increases in human life expectancy over the next century will be accompanied by increased frailty and massive and unsustainable health care costs. Developing means to extend the time that individuals remain healthy and free of age-related infirmities, called healthspan, has therefore become a critical goal of aging research. We show that small molecules produced by the microbiota and related to indole extend healthspan in geriatric worms, flies, and mice, without attendant effects on lifespan. Indoles act via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cause animals to retain a youthful gene expression profile. Indoles may represent a new class of therapeutics that improve the way we age as opposed to simply extending how long we live.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have identified conserved genetic pathways and small molecules associated with extension of lifespan in diverse organisms. However, extending lifespan does not result in concomitant extension in healthspan, defined as the proportion of time that an animal remains healthy and free of age-related infirmities. Rather, mutations that extend lifespan often reduce healthspan and increase frailty. The question arises as to whether factors or mechanisms exist that uncouple these processes and extend healthspan and reduce frailty independent of lifespan. We show that indoles from commensal microbiota extend healthspan of diverse organisms, including <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, and mice, but have a negligible effect on maximal lifespan. Effects of indoles on healthspan in worms and flies depend upon the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a conserved detector of xenobiotic small molecules. In <em>C. elegans</em>, indole induces a gene expression profile in aged animals reminiscent of that seen in the young, but which is distinct from that associated with normal aging. Moreover, in older animals, indole induces genes associated with oogenesis and, accordingly, extends fecundity and reproductive span. Together, these data suggest that small molecules related to indole and derived from commensal microbiota act in diverse phyla via conserved molecular pathways to promote healthy aging. These data raise the possibility of developing therapeutics based on microbiota-derived indole or its derivatives to extend healthspan and reduce frailty in humans.</p>

<p><em>double dissociation of single-interval and rhythmic temporal prediction in cerebellar degeneration and parkinson’s disease</em><br />

<p>One type relies on memories from past experiences. The other on rhythm. Both are critical to our ability to navigate and enjoy the world.<br />
New University of California, Berkeley, research shows the neural networks supporting each of these timekeepers are split between two different parts of the brain, depending on the task at hand.<br />
“Whether it’s sports, music, speech or even allocating attention, our study suggests that timing is not a unified process, but that there are two distinct ways in which we make temporal predictions and these depend on different parts of the brain,” said study lead author Assaf Breska, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at UC Berkeley.<br />
The findings, published online in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> journal, offer a new perspective on how humans calculate when to make a move.<br />
“Together, these brain systems allow us to not just exist in the moment, but to also actively anticipate the future,” said study senior author Richard Ivry, a UC Berkeley neuroscientist.<br />
Breska and Ivry studied the anticipatory timing strengths and deficits of people with Parkinson’s disease and people with cerebellar degeneration.<br />
They connected rhythmic timing to the basal ganglia, and interval timing — an internal timer based largely on our memory of prior experiences — to the cerebellum. Both are primal brain regions associated with movement and cognition.<br />
Moreover, their results suggest that if one of these neural clocks is misfiring, the other could theoretically step in.<br />
“Our study identifies not only the anticipatory contexts in which these neurological patients are impaired, but also the contexts in which they have no difficulty, suggesting we could modify their environments to make it easier for them to interact with the world in face of their symptoms,” Breska said.<br />
Non-pharmaceutical fixes for neurological timing deficits could include brain-training computer games and smartphone apps, deep brain stimulation and environmental design modifications, he said.<br />
To arrive at their conclusion, Breska and Ivry compared how well Parkinson’s and cerebellar degeneration patients used timing or “temporal” cues to focus their attention.<br />
Both groups viewed sequences of red, white and green squares as they flashed by at varying speeds on a computer screen, and pushed a button the moment they saw the green square. The white squares alerted them that the green square was coming up.<br />
In one sequence, the red, white and green squares followed a steady rhythm, and the cerebellar degeneration patients responded well to these rhythmic cues.<br />
In another, the colored squares followed a more complex pattern, with differing intervals between the red and green squares. This sequence was easier for the Parkinson’s patients to follow, and succeed at.<br />
“We show that patients with cerebellar degeneration are impaired in using non-rhythmic temporal cues while patients with basal ganglia degeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease are impaired in using rhythmic cues,” Ivry said.<br />
Ultimately, the results confirm that the brain uses two different mechanisms for anticipatory timing, challenging theories that a single brain system handles all our timing needs, researchers said.<br />
“Our results suggest at least two different ways in which the brain has evolved to anticipate the future,” said Breska.<br />
“A rhythm-based system is sensitive to periodic events in the world such as is inherent in speech and music,” he added. “And an interval system provides a more general anticipatory ability, sensitive to temporal regularities even in the absence of a rhythmic signal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Predicting the timing of upcoming events is critical for successful interaction in a dynamic world, and is recognized as a key computation for attentional orienting. Temporal predictions can be formed when recent events define a rhythmic structure, as well as in aperiodic streams or even in isolation, when a specified interval is known from previous exposure. However, whether predictions in these two contexts are mediated by a common mechanism, or by distinct, context-dependent mechanisms, is highly controversial. Moreover, although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been linked to temporal processing, the role of these subcortical structures in temporal orienting of attention is unclear. To address these issues, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration or Parkinson’s disease, with the latter serving as a model of basal ganglia dysfunction, on temporal prediction tasks in the subsecond range. The participants performed a visual detection task in which the onset of the target was predictable, based on either a rhythmic stream of stimuli, or a single interval, specified by two events that occurred within an aperiodic stream. Patients with cerebellar degeneration showed no benefit from single-interval cuing but preserved benefit from rhythm cuing, whereas patients with Parkinson’s disease showed no benefit from rhythm cuing but preserved benefit from single-interval cuing. This double dissociation provides causal evidence for functionally nonoverlapping mechanisms of rhythm- and interval-based temporal prediction for attentional orienting, and establishes the separable contributions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia to these functions, suggesting a mechanistic specialization across timing domains.</p>

<li>People’s welfare is a function of both time and money. People can – and, it is said, increasingly do – suffer time-poverty as well as money-poverty. It is undeniably true that people feel increasingly time pressured, particularly in dual- earner households. But much of the time devoted to paid and unpaid tasks is over and above that which is strictly necessary. In that sense, much of the time pressure that people feel is discretionary and of their own making. Using data from the 1992 Australian Time Use Survey, this paper demonstrates that the magnitude of this ‘time-pressure illusion’ varies across population groups, being least among lone parents and greatest among the childless and two-earner couples.</li>

<li>Consumers often organize their time by scheduling various tasks, but also leave some time unaccounted. The authors examine whether ending an interval of unaccounted time with an upcoming task systematically alters how this time is perceived and consumed. Eight studies conducted both in the lab and field show that bounded intervals of time (e.g., an hour before a scheduled meeting) feel prospectively shorter than unbounded intervals of time (e.g., an hour with nothing scheduled subsequently). Furthermore, consumers perform fewer tasks and are less likely to engage in relatively extended (though feasible) tasks during a bounded compared to an unbounded interval of time – even in the face of financial incentives. Finally, making a longer task easier to separate into subparts attenuates this effect.</li>

<p>Gilbert and Sima examined a single segment of the DNA in the highest possible 3D resolution and saw three sequences along the DNA molecule touching each other frequently. The researchers then used CRISPR, a sophisticated gene editing technology, to remove these three areas simultaneously.</p>
<p>And with that, they found that these three elements together were the key to DNA replication.</p>
<p>&quot;Removing these elements shifted the segment's replication time from the very beginning to the very end of the process,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;This was one of those moments where just one result knocks your socks off.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the effect on replication timing, the removal of the three elements caused the 3D structure of the DNA molecule to change dramatically.</p>
<p>&quot;We have for the first time pinpointed specific DNA sequences in the genome that regulate chromatin structure and replication timing,&quot; Sima said. &quot;These results reflect one possible model of how DNA folds inside cells and how these folding patterns could impact the hereditary materials' function.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing [RT]) is highly coupled with genome architecture, but cis-elements regulating either remain elusive. We created a series of CRISPR-mediated deletions and inversions of a pluripotency-associated topologically associating domain (TAD) in mouse ESCs. CTCF-associated domain boundaries were dispensable for RT. CTCF protein depletion weakened most TAD boundaries but had no effect on RT or A/B compartmentalization genome-wide. By contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites caused a domain-wide early-to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The dispensability of TAD boundaries and the necessity of these “early replication control elements” (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and inversions at additional domains. Our results demonstrate that discrete cis-regulatory elements orchestrate domain-wide RT, A/B compartmentalization, TAD architecture, and transcription, revealing fundamental principles linking genome structure and function.</p>

<li>When determining responsibility for harmful actions, people often consider whether the actor behaved intentionally. The spread of surveillance cameras, “on-officer” recording devices, and smart-phone video makes it increasingly likely that such judgments are aided by video replay. Yet, little is known about how different qualities of the video, such as replay speed, affect human judgment. We demonstrate that slow motion replay can systematically increase judgments of intent because it gives viewers the false impression that the actor had more time to premeditate before acting. In legal proceedings, these judgments of intent can mean the difference between life and death. Thus, any benefits of video replay should be weighed against its potentially biasing effects.</li>

<p><em>stratigraphic signatures of mass extinctions: ecological and sedimentary determinants</em><br />

<p>Florida Museum of Natural History researchers used a series of 130-foot cores drilled from the Po Plain in northeastern Italy to test a thought experiment: Imagine catastrophe strikes the Adriatic Sea, swiftly wiping out modern marine life. Could this hypothetical mass extinction be reconstructed correctly from mollusks — hard-shelled animals such as oysters and mussels — preserved in these cores?<br />
When they examined the cores, the results were “somewhat unnerving,” said Michal Kowalewski, Thompson Chair of Invertebrate Paleontology and the study’s principal investigator.<br />
Paleontologists use the age of a species’ last-known fossil to estimate the timing of extinction. A sudden extinction in the Adriatic Sea today should leave the youngest remains of many mollusk species in the sediments currently forming on the shore and seabed, the “ground zero” of the hypothetical extinction event. But the team found only six of 119 mollusk species — all of which are still alive in the area — at the top of the cores. Instead, the last fossil examples of many of these species often appeared in clusters dotted throughout the cores, suggesting smaller bursts of extinctions over a longer timeline, not a single massive die-off.<br />
Taken at face value, the cores presented a dramatically distorted record of both the timing and tempo of extinction, potentially calling into question some of the methods paleontologists commonly use to interpret past mass extinctions.<br />
“We’re not saying you cannot study mass extinctions. You can,” Kowalewski said. “What we’re saying is that the nature of the geological record is complicated, so it is not trivial to decipher it correctly.”<br />
The results of their analysis did not come as a complete surprise. Computer models designed by paleontologists Steven Holland and Mark Patzkowsky had made similar predictions about how the final resting place of fossils — influenced by species’ ecological preferences, sea level and the makeup of sedimentary basins — could skew patterns of mass extinction.<br />
“This is, to my knowledge, the first empirical study to use the fossil record of living species to test these models rigorously and computationally, rather than theoretically,” Kowalewski said. “We know these species are still living in the Adriatic Sea, so we can be sure that their disappearance from the fossil record does not represent a true extinction.”<br />
Paleontologists have been grappling with the complications of interpreting mass extinctions in the fossil record for several decades. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs was thought to be a gradual, drawn-out process until evidence of a lethal meteor impact emerged in 1980. The problem is a phenomenon known as the Signor-Lipps effect: Because the fossil record is incompletely sampled, the last-known fossil of a given species is almost certainly not the last member of that species, which muddles our ability to date extinctions.<br />
Applied on a larger scale, the Signor-Lipps effect can make abrupt mass extinctions appear gradual. A common approach to correct for this effect is to assume that where fossils end up — and are later discovered — is random, and mathematically adjust estimates of extinction timing accordingly.<br />
But it’s more complicated than that, Kowalewski said, because the fossil record is not created in a random way.<br />
Climatic cycles trigger changes in sea level, causing shorelines to advance or recede and driving changes in environments. A beach may become a mudflat, for example, or a delta can turn into a coastal plain. Shifts in sea level can also affect sedimentation rates — how quickly mud and sand are deposited. These factors can cause last occurrences of fossils to cluster together and influence the probability of finding fossils in a given location.<br />
When the researchers reordered the species represented in the cores from the Po basin according to their last occurrence, they noted several points at which many species appeared to vanish simultaneously. In reality, none of the species had gone extinct. They disappeared from a given site either because local environmental conditions changed, or they were simply missed during the sampling, said Rafal Nawrot, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral researcher in invertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum.<br />
The cores also depicted a false pattern of extinction, with the majority of offshore species disappearing in a single large “pulse” in the lower part of the cores and shallow-water and brackish species fading out in several smaller pulses. This is because species followed their preferred habitats as they shifted with changing sea levels. Deeper-water dwellers vanished first, as the local river delta started to expand into the Adriatic Sea, replacing open sea with coastal conditions. When shorelines advanced even farther, shallow-water species disappeared as well.<br />
“It’s important to admit that fossil species — just like modern ones — have specific ecological requirements, which sounds obvious but is not always acknowledged,” Nawrot said.<br />
Current methods may give researchers the illusion of precision but fail to account for these factors, which are crucial to correctly interpreting past extinction events, he said.<br />
“If you apply methods based on the assumption of random fossilization, you get a precise estimate, but it may be wrong by millions of years,” Nawrot said. “Not only the pattern of extinction but also the timing of extinction would be wrongly interpreted, so this is quite important.”<br />
While the findings are sobering, the situation is far from hopeless, Kowalewski said. When the team incorporated methods that accounted for species’ ecological preferences, distribution and abundance into the analysis, the results were a much closer approximation of what exists in the basin today.<br />
“This provides us with an initial guideline of how to analyze these types of data to get a more realistic assessment of extinction events,” Kowalewski said. “Certainly, this is a work in progress.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> stratigraphic patterns of last occurrences (LOs) of fossil taxa potentially fingerprint mass extinctions and delineate rates and geometries of those events. Although empirical studies of mass extinctions recognize that random sampling causes LOs to occur earlier than the time of extinction (Signor–Lipps effect), sequence stratigraphic controls on the position of LOs are rarely considered. By tracing stratigraphic ranges of extant mollusc species preserved in the Holocene succession of the Po coastal plain (Italy), we demonstrated that, if mass extinction took place today, complex but entirely false extinction patterns would be recorded regionally due to shifts in local community composition and non-random variation in the abundance of skeletal remains, both controlled by relative sea-level changes. Consequently, rather than following an apparent gradual pattern expected from the Signor–Lipps effect, LOs concentrated within intervals of stratigraphic condensation and strong facies shifts mimicking sudden extinction pulses. Methods assuming uniform recovery potential of fossils falsely supported stepwise extinction patterns among studied species and systematically underestimated their stratigraphic ranges. Such effects of stratigraphic architecture, co-produced by ecological, sedimentary and taphonomic processes, can easily confound interpretations of the timing, duration and selectivity of mass extinction events. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic context when inferring extinction dynamics from the fossil record.</p>

<li>Understanding and explaining the nature of time remains a major challenge for science</li>
<li>often missing factor
<ul>
<li>the problem with writing papers is that to have a significant publishable result you want something that is true always (not only true, as most discussions of the topic address) the always is what concerns us here. variability with time within the same individual is discounted.</li>
<li>case of a scientific study where data collected indicated people born in month of may self–reported as most lucky… data was collected in mid–april. common lack of experimental control for time factors is symptom of wider societal relation to time and change, not individual failing of understanding</li>

<li>the limiting factor in this age is time. we need to deal with the consequences of our ancestors’ actions, and we need to do it fast. change has come in the past when those people who hold power who also hold opinions that are no longer suited to the world–as–it–is pass on that power to a new generation. unfortunately the consequences this time are so huge that it is irresponsible to wait many years for that change to come to pass. the problem is compounded not only by the magnitude of the consequences — damage to the entirety of the earth — but also by the longevity of the people in power — longer than in living memory — and the concentration of that power — more concentrated than in living memory.
<ul>
<li>to achieve this goal it is not necessary to aim for perfection. the tale of the hundredth monkey illustrates this: “there was once a land which had been poisoned by humans, and they wanted to learn how long it would take for life to cover the land once more. ten thousand monkey were made to settle on the land, which bore coconut by the time the ten thousand monkey were settled. however the coconut also bore the poison on their outer husk so that a nut must be first washed in the river afore it were eaten. so they tried to teach the monkey to wash the coconut, and sure enough, at the end of the first day, one little monkey had learned to wash the coconut. at the end of the second day, another two monkey had learned to wash the coconut. and so it continued that each day more and more monkey learned to wash the coconut. but something happened they did not expect. one day, after the hundredth monkey had learned to wash the coconut, they came to the river and saw lined upon the bank many thousand monkey washing coconut. and they were sore confused and said, how had this come to pass?”</li>

<li>“Is a person abusive because of a privileged upbringing, or does a privileged upbringing make a person abusive?” is the sort of nice zero–sum assumption question that may be helpful in creating an argument, but is worthless in working towards a solution. The problem is that generalisation of logic leaves out <em>time</em>, and, specifically, <em>change</em>. Both assertions could be true, at certain times, for certain people — and no longer true at other times, for even the same people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00767</h2>
<ul>
<li>understanding time is not an alternative to the eternal world view, it is the productive, positive part. when we are infants, and when our faculties dissolve near our ends, we have the eternal world view. it does not produce, it can only consume. but in the prime of our lives, we can choose to produce. unfortunately if we are excessively privileged or abused we never grow into our prime and thus know only to destroy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00667</h2>
<ul>
<li>people often confuse things that apply at a particular time, in a particular context, and believe these are always, universally correct. this is no less true in science as in religion. for example, a scientific study that generalises from several decisions of many individuals, and purports to explain all decisions of individuals, is very likely to be wrong. it may be that some people are open to changing their opinion sometimes, but a study that captures only a few decisions from each individual will not see this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00567</h2>
<ul>
<li>time is something we mostly take for granted, like space and air. it is something we rarely try to understand, and so it has become one of our greatest weaknesses.
<ul>
<li>for to understand, even a little, of time, means we understand processes, such as life, a little more clearly.</li>
<li>the power of time is much greater than physical power, it can be accumulative.</li>
<li>the reliance on definition comes in part from a misunderstanding of time. it is assumed that something can be permanent, that the concept of permanence is something useful. similarly with perfection, and the concept of limits.</li>
<li>we will be considering practical applications of the concept of time, rather than certain definitions of it.</li>
<li>i don't believe time exists. nonetheless, many people are beholden to time. so i am not going to talk today about time's existence but rather about what we can do about our relationship with time.</li>
<li>because the two fundamental concepts of time and of change are intimately and inseparably related in our culture, to deal with change is to deal with time.</li>
<li>the illusion of time can be likened to the illusion of space. we are familiar with the illusion of three dimensions transmitted through the medium of an essentially two-dimensional surface, be it paper, or a screen, or an electronic device. with a little thought we can imagine our perception of time in the same way, as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional phenomenon.</li>
<li>now why should we bother with this? i used to believe that if time was not an evolutionarily useful concept it would not be so widely used. but contained in that simple-seeming statement are both a fallacy and a trap. firstly, time, in the way that it was perceived by many people in &quot;western&quot; cultures at the end of the twentieth century, is not the same as it is perceived in other human cultures in the present and the past, and perhaps very different to what is perceived by other organisms. secondly, our definition of time is circular, in that we use it in the very definition we give of it. evolution, useful and concept are all dependent on our definition of time, for example.</li>
<li>well, i say to this, even if our words and present concepts are all we have, let us see what we can do with them.</li>
