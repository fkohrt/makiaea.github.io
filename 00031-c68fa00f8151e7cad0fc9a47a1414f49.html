<ul>
<li>• Start looking for an interesting topic early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #2. Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition
<ul>
<li>• Start with general sources and then follow references to find the more targeted sources where good thesis ideas often hide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #3. Seek a Second Opinion
<ul>
<li>• A thesis is not a thesis until a professor has approved it.</li>

<li>• Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to getting it right.</li>
<li>• Describe your argument in a topic-level outline.</li>
<li>• Type supporting quotes from sources directly into your outline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #6. Consult Your Expert Panel
<ul>
<li>• Before starting to write, get some opinions on the organization of your argument and your support from classmates and friends who are familiar with the general area of study.</li>
<li>• The more important the paper, the more people who should review it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #7. Write Without the Agony
<ul>
<li>• Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly.</li>
<li>• Write no more than three to five pages per weekday and five to eight pages per weekend day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #8. Fix, Don't Fixate
<ul>
<li>• Solid editing requires only three careful passes:</li>
<li>– The Argument Adjustment Pass: Read the paper carefully on your computer to make sure your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs improvement.</li>
<li>– The Out Loud Pass: Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking any awkward passages or unclear explanations.</li>
<li>– The Sanity Pass: A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the overall flow and to root out any remaining errors.</li>

<li>Climate change, predatory capitalism and religious fundamentalism really are only ‘surface’ phenomena, because the human actions leading to them are determined by the deep structure of our minds, the functional architecture of our culturally embedded brains. The real challenge is not climate change as such; the true problems humankind must confront are the inbuilt features of our very own minds, such as systematic rationality and empathy deficits, self-deception, and the extreme vulnerability of the inner mechanisms creating mental autonomy.</li>
<li>This process of learning about ourselves is emotionally unattractive to many. It forces us to confront centuries-old systems of systematic self-deception, often represented by certain forms of organised religion. Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of mental autonomy is our general inability to notice when we lack it. Not only does there seem to be a widespread form of ‘introspective neglect’ related to the losses of cognitive self-control characterising our inner life, resembling a form of anosognosia or anosodiaphoria (as in patients unable to become aware of, or who remain indifferent to, the existence of a disability, such as the fact that their left arm is paralysed). The phenomenon of mind-wandering itself is also clearly related to denial and confabulation. Introspective experience and the verbal reports of one’s own inner life are probably likely to be distorted by overconfidence bias regarding the degree to which one actually is in control, by illusions of superiority and introspection illusion (in which we falsely assume direct insight into the origins of our mental states, while treating others’ introspections as unreliable).</li>
<li>What is clear by now is that our societies lack systematic and institutionalised ways of enhancing citizens’ mental autonomy. This is a neglected duty of care on the part of governments. There can be no politically mature citizens without a sufficient degree of mental autonomy, but society as a whole does not act to protect or increase it. Yet, it might be the most precious resource of all. In the end, and in the face of serious existential risks posed by environmental degradation and advanced capitalism, we must understand that citizens’ collective level of mental autonomy will be the decisive factor.</li>
<li>It was William James, the father of American psychology, who said in 1892: ‘And the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. […] And education which should improve this faculty would be <em>the</em> education <em>par excellence</em>.’ We can finally see more clearly what meditation is really about: over the centuries, the main goal has always been a sustained enhancement of one’s mental autonomy.</li>

<li>we compared the amounts of learning achieved using two different instructional approaches under controlled conditions. We measured the learning of a specific set of topics and objectives when taught by 3 hours of traditional lecture given by an experienced highly rated instructor and 3 hours of instruction given by a trained but inexperienced instructor using instruction based on research in cognitive psychology and physics education. The comparison was made between two large sections (N = 267 and N = 271) of an introductory undergraduate physics course. We found increased student attendance, higher engagement, and more than twice the learning in the section taught using research-based instruction.</li>

<p>It is not the intention of this paper to review the Hawthorne effect and its history, but we comment on it only because this is such a frequent question raised about this work. It is not plausible that it resulted in a significant impact on the results reported here. As discussed extensively in (S1-S3), analyses of the methodology and data used in the original Hawthorne plant studies reveal both serious flaws in the methodology, and an absence of statistically significant data supporting the existence of the claimed effect. Thus, the failure to replicate such an effect in an educational setting, as reported in (S4), is not surprising.</p>

<p><em>respiration modulates olfactory memory consolidation in humans</em><br />

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3360-17.2018">http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3360-17.2018</a></p>

<p>&quot;Our study shows that we remember smells better if we breathe through the nose when the memory is being consolidated -- the process that takes place between learning and memory retrieval,&quot; says Artin Arshamian, researcher at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet. &quot;This is the first time someone has demonstrated this.&quot;</p>
<p>One reason why this phenomenon has not previously been available for study is that the most common laboratory animals -- rats and mice -- cannot breathe naturally through their mouths.</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers had participants learn twelve different smells on two separate occasions. They were then asked to either breathe through their noses or mouths for one hour. When the time was up, the participants were presented with the old as well as a new set of twelve smells, and asked to say if each one was from the learning session or new.</p>
<p>The results showed that when the participants breathed through their noses between the time of learning and recognition, they remembered the smells better.</p>
<p>New method facilitates measuring activity in the brain</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is to measure what actually happens in the brain during breathing and how this is linked to memory,&quot; says Dr Arshamian. &quot;This was previously a practical impossibility as electrodes had to be inserted directly into the brain. We've managed to get round this problem and now we're developing, with my colleague Johan Lundström, a new means of measuring activity in the olfactory bulb and brain without having to insert electrodes.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier research has shown that the receptors in the olfactory bulb detect not only smells but also variations in the airflow itself. In the different phases of inhalation and exhalation, different parts of the brain are activated. But how the synchronisation of breathing and brain activity happens and how it affects the brain and therefore our behaviour is unknown. Traditional medicine has often, however, stressed the importance of breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that breathing affects our behaviour is actually not new,&quot; says Dr Arshamian. &quot;In fact, the knowledge has been around for thousands of years in such areas as meditation. But no one has managed to prove scientifically what actually goes on in the brain. We now have tools that can reveal new clinical knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> In mammals respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and nonhuman animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a 1 h awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared with mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared with the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</p>

<li>Our review of the learning-styles literature led us to define a particular type of evidence that we see as a minimum precondition for validating the use of a learning-style assessment in an instructional setting. As described earlier, we have been unable to find any evidence that clearly meets this standard. Moreover, several studies that used the appropriate type of research design found results that contradict the most widely held version of the learning-styles hypothesis, namely, what we have referred to as the meshing hypothesis (Constantinidou &amp; Baker, 2002; Massa &amp; Mayer, 2006). The contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning-styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is, in our opinion, striking and disturbing. If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility, it remains to be demonstrated.</li>

<p><em>dispelling the myth: training in education or neuroscience decreases but does not eliminate beliefs in neuromyths</em><br />

<li>Thus, the integration of multiple modalities can be beneficial for learning and this practice is conflated with the learning styles neuromyth. In other words, this particular neuromyth presents a challenge to the education field because it seems to be supporting effective instructional practice, but for the wrong reasons. To dispel this particular myth might inadvertently discourage diversity in instructional approaches if it is not paired with explicit discussion of the distinctions between learning styles theory and multimodal instruction.</li>
<li>Another limitation of the true/false paradigm is that we cannot discern participants' certainty of their answers because we did not include an “I don't know” answer choice.</li>
<li>Neuromyths are misconceptions about brain research and its application to education and learning. Previous research has shown that these myths may be quite pervasive among educators, but less is known about how these rates compare to the general public or to individuals who have more exposure to neuroscience. This study is the first to use a large sample from the United States to compare the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among educators, the general public, and individuals with high neuroscience exposure. Neuromyth survey responses and demographics were gathered via an online survey hosted at TestMyBrain.org. We compared performance among the three groups of interest: educators (<em>N</em> = 598), high neuroscience exposure (<em>N</em> = 234), and the general public (<em>N</em> = 3,045) and analyzed predictors of individual differences in neuromyths performance. In an exploratory factor analysis, we found that a core group of 7 “classic” neuromyths factored together (items related to learning styles, dyslexia, the Mozart effect, the impact of sugar on attention, right-brain/left-brain learners, and using 10% of the brain). The general public endorsed the greatest number of neuromyths (<em>M</em> = 68%), with significantly fewer endorsed by educators (<em>M</em> = 56%), and still fewer endorsed by the high neuroscience exposure group (<em>M</em> = 46%). The two most commonly endorsed neuromyths across all groups were related to learning styles and dyslexia. More accurate performance on neuromyths was predicted by age (being younger), education (having a graduate degree), exposure to neuroscience courses, and exposure to peer-reviewed science. These findings suggest that training in education and neuroscience can help reduce but does not eliminate belief in neuromyths. We discuss the possible underlying roots of the most prevalent neuromyths and implications for classroom practice. These empirical results can be useful for developing comprehensive training modules for educators that target general misconceptions about the brain and learning.</li>

<li>Intuitive conceptions in mathematics guide the interpretation of mathematical concepts. We investigated if they bias teachers’ conceptions of student arithmetic word problem solving strategies, which should be part of their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In individual interviews, teachers and non-teaching adults were asked to describe students’ strategies in situational contexts within or outside the scope of the intuitive conception. The results revealed that teachers relied on their PCK and identified student strategies; however, in the presence of the intuitive conception, their PCK was overshadowed and they ceased to differ significantly from non-teachers. This brings the attention to certain biases that can have a strong impact on teachers’ efficient use of PCK.</li>

<li>Working memory (WM) is the ability to maintain and manipulate task-relevant information in the absence of sensory input. While its improvement through training is of great interest, the degree to which WM training transfers to untrained WM tasks (near transfer) and other untrained cognitive skills (far transfer) remains debated and the mechanism(s) underlying transfer are unclear. Here we hypothesized that a critical feature of dual n-back training is its reliance on maintaining relational information in WM. In experiment 1, using an individual differences approach, we found evidence that performance on an n-back task was predicted by performance on a measure of relational WM (i.e., WM for vertical spatial relationships independent of absolute spatial locations), whereas the same was not true for a complex span WM task. In experiment 2, we tested the idea that reliance on relational WM is critical to produce transfer from n-back but not complex span task training. Participants completed adaptive training on either a dual n-back task, a symmetry span task, or on a non-WM active control task. We found evidence of near transfer for the dual n-back group; however, far transfer to a measure of fluid intelligence did not emerge. Recording EEG during a separate WM transfer task, we examined group-specific, training-related changes in alpha power, which are proposed to be sensitive to WM demands and top-down modulation of WM. Results indicated that the dual n-back group showed significantly greater frontal alpha power after training compared to before training, more so than both other groups. However, we found no evidence of improvement on measures of relational WM for the dual n-back group, suggesting that near transfer may not be dependent on relational WM. These results suggest that dual n-back and complex span task training may differ in their effectiveness to elicit near transfer as well as in the underlying neural changes they facilitate.</li>

<ul>
<li>Working memory is a construct of primary relevance to many areas of psychology. Two types of tasks have been used to measure working memory, primarily in different research areas: Complex span tasks are commonly used in behavioral studies in the cognitive and individual-differences literature, whereas <em>n</em>-back tasks have been used more frequently in cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neural underpinnings of working memory. Despite both categories of tasks being labeled as “working memory” measures, previous empirical studies have provided mixed evidence regarding the shared amount of overlapping processes between complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present meta-analysis showed that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are weakly correlated, although significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. A follow-up analysis of unpublished data indicated that the sample composition affects the relationship between the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks, following the law of diminishing returns. Finally, a separate meta-analysis indicated that the simple span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are correlated to the same extent as are the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present findings indicate that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks cannot be used interchangeably as working memory measures in research applications.</li>

<li>Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control.</li>

<p><em>montessori preschool elevates and equalizes child outcomes: a longitudinal study</em><br />
angeline s. lillard et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01783">dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01783</a></p>

<li>Quality preschool programs that develop the whole child through age-appropriate socioemotional and cognitive skill-building hold promise for significantly improving child outcomes. However, preschool programs tend to either be teacher-led and didactic, or else to lack academic content. One preschool model that involves both child-directed, freely chosen activity and academic content is Montessori. Here we report a longitudinal study that took advantage of randomized lottery-based admission to two public Montessori magnet schools in a high-poverty American city. The final sample included 141 children, 70 in Montessori and 71 in other schools, most of whom were tested 4 times over 3 years, from the first semester to the end of preschool (ages 3–6), on a variety of cognitive and socio-emotional measures. Montessori preschool elevated children’s outcomes in several ways. Although not different at the first test point, over time the Montessori children fared better on measures of academic achievement, social understanding, and mastery orientation, and they also reported relatively more liking of scholastic tasks. They also scored higher on executive function when they were 4. In addition to elevating overall performance on these measures, Montessori preschool also equalized outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes. First, the difference in academic achievement between lower income Montessori and higher income conventionally schooled children was smaller at each time point, and was not (statistically speaking) significantly different at the end of the study. Second, defying the typical finding that executive function predicts academic achievement, in Montessori classrooms children with lower executive function scored as well on academic achievement as those with higher executive function. This suggests that Montessori preschool has potential to elevate and equalize important outcomes, and a larger study of public Montessori preschools is warranted.</li>

<p><em>resources, learning, and policy: the relative effects of social and financial capital on student learning in schools</em><br />

<p>Social capital is the name scientists give to the network of relationships between school officials, teachers, parents and the community that builds trust and norms promoting academic achievement.<br />
The study found that social capital had a three- to five-times larger effect than financial capital on reading and math scores in Michigan schools.<br />
“When we talk about why some schools perform better than others, differences in the amount of money they have to spend is often assumed to be an explanation,” said Roger Goddard, co-author of the study and Novice G. Fawcett Chair and professor of educational administration at The Ohio State University.<br />
“We found that money is certainly important. But this study also shows that social capital deserves a larger role in our thinking about cost-effective ways to support students, especially the most vulnerable.”<br />
Goddard conducted the research with Serena Salloum of Ball State University and Dan Berebitsky of Southern Methodist University. The study appears online in the <em>Journal of Education for Students Placed at Risk</em> and will be published in a future print edition.<br />
The study involved 5,003 students and their teachers in 78 randomly selected public elementary schools in Michigan. The sample is representative of the demographics of all elementary schools in the state.<br />
Teachers completed a questionnaire that measured levels of social capital in their schools. They rated how much they agreed with statements like “Parent involvement supports learning here,” “Teachers in this school trust their students” and “Community involvement facilitates learning here.”<br />
State data on instructional expenditures per pupil was used to measure financial capital at each school.<br />
Finally, the researchers used student performance on state-mandated fourth-grade reading and mathematics tests to measure student learning.<br />
Results showed that on average schools that spent more money did have better test scores than those that spent less. But the effect of social capital was three times larger than financial capital on math scores and five times larger on reading scores.<br />
“Social capital was not only more important to learning than instructional expenditures, but also more important than the schools’ poverty, ethnic makeup or prior achievement,” Goddard said.<br />
While social capital tended to go down in schools as poverty levels increased, it wasn’t a major decrease.<br />
“We could see from our data that more than half of the social capital that schools have access to has nothing to do with the level of poverty in the communities they serve,” he said.<br />
“Our results really speak to the importance and the practicality of building social capital in high-poverty neighborhoods where they need it the most.”<br />
The study also found that the money spent on student learning was not associated with levels of social capital in schools. That means schools can’t “buy” social capital just by spending more money. Social relationships require a different kind of investment, Goddard said.<br />
The study can’t answer how to cultivate social capital in schools. But Goddard has some ideas.<br />
One is for schools to do more to help teachers work together.<br />
“Research shows that the more teachers collaborate, the more they work together on instructional improvement, the higher the test scores of their students. That’s because collaborative work builds social capital that provides students with access to valuable support,” he said.<br />
Building connections to the community is important, too. School-based mentoring programs that connect children to adults in the community is one idea.<br />
“Sustained interactions over time focused on children’s learning and effective teaching practice are the best way for people to build trust and build networks that are at the heart of social capital,” Goddard said.<br />
“We need intentional effort by schools to build social capital. We can’t leave it to chance.”</p>
</li>

<p><em>abstract</em> In this paper, we note the contrasting positions occupied by social and financial capital in state and federal education policy and compare their relative impacts on student learning. To make such a comparison, we analyzed data from a representative sample of Michigan’s elementary schools using multilevel structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among social capital, instructional expenditures, and student achievement. We found that the level of social capital characterizing schools was not a function of instructional expenditures. We also found that both social and financial capital had a positive and significant relationship with reading and mathematics student achievement. However, the effect of social capital was three and five times larger than that of financial capital on mathematics and reading, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for education policy and programs that might improve student learning by strengthening social relationships.</p>

<p><em>forebrain-specific, conditional silencing of staufen2 alters synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory in rats</em><br />

<li>Dendritic messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and subsequent local translation in dendrites critically contributes to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Little is known, however, about the contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to these processes in vivo.<br />
Results<br />
To delineate the role of the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (Stau2), we generate a transgenic rat model, in which Stau2 expression is conditionally silenced by Cre-inducible expression of a microRNA (miRNA) targeting Stau2 mRNA in adult forebrain neurons. Known physiological mRNA targets for Stau2, such as <em>RhoA</em>, <em>Complexin 1</em>, and <em>Rgs4</em> mRNAs, are found to be dysregulated in brains of Stau2-deficient rats. In vivo electrophysiological recordings reveal synaptic strengthening upon stimulation, showing a shift in the frequency-response function of hippocampal synaptic plasticity to favor long-term potentiation and impair long-term depression in Stau2-deficient rats. These observations are accompanied by deficits in hippocampal spatial working memory, spatial novelty detection, and in tasks investigating associative learning and memory.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Together, these experiments reveal a critical contribution of Stau2 to various forms of synaptic plasticity including spatial working memory and cognitive management of new environmental information. These findings might contribute to the development of treatments for conditions associated with learning and memory deficits.</li>

<li>Adolescence is associated with enhanced striatal activity in response to rewards. This has been linked to increased risk-taking behavior and negative health outcomes. However, striatal activity is also important for learning, yet it is unknown whether heightened striatal responses in adolescence also benefit cognitive learning performance. In this longitudinal fMRI study (736 scans spanning 5 years in participants ages 8–29), we investigate whether adolescents show enhanced striatal activity during feedback learning, and whether this enhanced activity is associated with better learning performance. Here we report that neural activity indicating sensitivity to informative value of feedback peaks in late adolescence and occurs in dorsal caudate, ventral caudate, and nucleus accumbens. Increased activity in dorsal and ventral caudate predicts better current and future learning performance. This suggests that enhanced striatal activity in adolescents is adaptive for learning and may point to adolescence as a unique life phase for increased feedback-learning performance.</li>

<p>•The neuronal gene <em>Arc</em> encodes a protein that forms virus-like capsids<br />
•Arc protein exhibits similar biochemical properties as retroviral Gag proteins<br />
•Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs)<br />
•Arc EVs and capsids can mediate intercellular transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA in neurons</p>
<p>The neuronal gene <em>Arc</em> is essential for long-lasting information storage in the mammalian brain, mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about Arc’s molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA into new target cells, where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer <em>Arc</em> mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/<em>gypsy</em> retrotransposons, which are also ancestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system.</p>

<li>“They were only considering the planes that had returned. They were not taking into account the planes that had not returned (i.e., the planes that had been shot down). The observable bullet holes suggested that the area around the cockpit and tail didn’t need reinforcing because it was never hit. In fact, the planes that were hit in these places were crashing because this is where they were most vulnerable.”</li>
<li>sullenberger “Everything we know in aviation, every rule in the rule book, every procedure we have, we know because someone somewhere died . . . We have purchased at great cost, lessons literally bought with blood that we have to preserve as institutional knowledge and pass on to succeeding generations. We cannot have the moral failure of forgetting these lessons and have to relearn them.”</li>
<li>This also reveals a subtle asymmetry between confirmation and falsification, between success and failure. If you are careful enough to limit your observations to low altitudes and open containers, you could find countless instances where water does indeed boil at 100ºC. But none of this successful “evidence” would have expanded our knowledge very much. Indeed, in one sense, it would not have even increased the probability of the assertion “water always boils at 100ºC.”</li>
<li>This point was originally made by the Scottish philosopher David Hume in the eighteenth century, and popularized recently by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the mathematician and author. Taleb has pointed out that you could observe a million white swans, but this would not prove the proposition: all swans are white. The observation of a single black swan, on the other hand, would conclusively demonstrate its falsehood.</li>

Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative.”</li>

They would get an “A” for 50 lbs of pots, a “B” for 40 lbs, and so on. The other half would be graded on quality. They just had to bring along their one, perfect pot.</li>
<li>The results were emphatic: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group graded for quantity. As Bayles and Orland put it: “It seems that while the ‘quantity’ group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the ‘quality’ group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”</li>

<p><em>advancing the science of collaborative problem solving</em><br />
arthur c. graesser et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1529100618808244">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1529100618808244</a></p>

<p>an interdisciplinary team of researchers identifies the essential cognitive and social components of collaborative problem solving (CPS) and shows how integrating existing knowledge from a variety of fields can lead to new ways of assessing and training these abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;CPS is an essential skill in the workforce and the community because many of the problems faced in the modern world require teams to integrate group achievements with team members' idiosyncratic knowledge,&quot; the authors of the report say.</p>
<p>As societies and technologies become increasingly complex, they generate increasingly complex problems. Devising efficient, effective, and innovative solutions to these complex problems requires CPS skills that most students lack. According to a 2015 assessment of more than 500,000 15-year-old students conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, only 8% of students around the world showed strong CPS skills.</p>
<p>&quot;The experiences of students in and out of the classroom are not preparing them for these skills that are needed as adults,&quot; Graesser and colleagues write.</p>
<p>This unique set of cognitive and social skills include:</p>
<p>Shared understanding: Group members share common goals when solving a new problem.<br />
Accountability: The contributions that each member makes are visible to the rest of the group.<br />
Differentiated roles: Group members draw on their specific expertise to complete different tasks.<br />
Interdependency: Group members depend on the contributions of others to solve the problem.<br />
One reason for the lack of CPS training is a deficit in evidence-based standards and curricula. Secondary school curricula typically focus on educating task- and discipline-specific knowledge, placing little emphasis on educating students' ability to communicate and collaborate effectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Students rarely receive meaningful instruction, modeling, and feedback on collaboration,&quot; the researchers note.</p>
<p>When students do receive training relevant to CPS, it is often because they participate in extracurricular activities such as band, sports, student newspapers, and volunteer activities. Even then, the collaborative competencies are not directly relevant to problem solving. The authors argue that it is time to make CPS activities a core part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Although considerable psychological, educational, and management research has examined factors that contribute to effective learning, teamwork, and decision making, research that directly examines how to improve collaborative problem solving is scarce.</p>
<p>According to the authors, &quot;we are nearly at ground zero in identifying pedagogical approaches to improving CPS skills.&quot;</p>
<p>Developing and implementing effective CPS training stands to have significant societal impacts across a wide range of domains, including business, science, education, technology, environment, and public health. In a project funded by the National Science Foundation, for example, Fiore and other research team members are training students to collaborate across a range of disciplines -- including environmental science, ecology, biology, law, and policy -- to identify ways to address social, business, and agricultural effects of rising sea levels in Virginia's Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>&quot;It's exciting to engage in real world testing of methods developed in laboratory studies on teamwork, to see how feedback on collaboration, and reflection on that feedback to improve teamwork strategies, can improve students' problem solving,&quot; Fiore explains.</p>
<p>Identifying the necessary components of this kind of training and determining how to translate those components across a variety of real-world settings will, itself, require interdisciplinary cooperation among researchers, educators, and policymakers.</p>
<p>In the commentary, Gauvain emphasizes that achieving a comprehensive understanding of CPS requires taking a developmental perspective and she notes that psychological scientists will be essential in this endeavor. Graesser and colleagues agree:</p>
<p>&quot;When psychological scientists collaborate with educational researchers, computer scientists, psychometricians, and educational experts, we hope to move forward in addressing this global deficit in CPS,&quot; they conclude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been receiving increasing international attention because much of the complex work in the modern world is performed by teams. However, systematic education and training on CPS is lacking for those entering and participating in the workforce. In 2015, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a global test of educational progress, documented the low levels of proficiency in CPS. This result not only underscores a significant societal need but also presents an important opportunity for psychological scientists to develop, adopt, and implement theory and empirical research on CPS and to work with educators and policy experts to improve training in CPS. This article offers some directions for psychological science to participate in the growing attention to CPS throughout the world. First, it identifies the existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research that focus on CPS. Second, it provides examples of how recent technologies can automate analyses of CPS processes and assessments so that substantially larger data sets can be analyzed and so students can receive immediate feedback on their CPS performance. Third, it identifies some challenges, debates, and uncertainties in creating an infrastructure for research, education, and training in CPS. CPS education and assessment are expected to improve when supported by larger data sets and theoretical frameworks that are informed by psychological science. This will require interdisciplinary efforts that include expertise in psychological science, education, assessment, intelligent digital technologies, and policy.</p>

<li>In its most basic form, learning comes down to feedback. For example, if you have a headache and take a drug, you expect the drug will make your headache go away. If you’re right, you’ll take that drug the next time you have a headache. If you’re wrong, you’ll try something else. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied this aspect of learning extensively and even traced it to specific parts of the brain that process feedback and drive learning.<br />
Still, that picture of learning is incomplete, Chen said. Even in relatively uncomplicated laboratory experiments, let alone life in the real world, humans and other animals need to figure out what to learn from — essentially, what’s feedback and what’s noise. Despite that need, it’s an issue psychologists and neuroscientists have not paid as much attention to.<br />
To start to remedy that, Chen and colleagues taught mice to associate particular odors with good and bad outcomes. One odor signaled a sip of water was coming, while another signaled the mouse was about to get a puff of air to the face.<br />
Later, the researchers replaced the air puff with a mild electric shock — something that would presumably command a bit more attention. The team found that neurons in the PVT tracked that change. During the air-puff phase, two-thirds of PVT neurons responded to both odors while an additional 30 percent were activated only by the odor signaling water. In other words, during this phase the PVT responded to both good and bad outcomes, but there was greater response to good.<br />
During the electric-shock phase, however, the balance shifted. Almost all PVT neurons responded to the shock, while about three quarters of them responded to both good and bad outcomes.<br />
A similar shift happened when mice had had their fill of water. Now that water mattered less to the mice, the PVT was less responsive to water and more responsive to air puffs, meaning it became more responsive to bad outcomes and less so to good ones. Taken together, the results showed the PVT tracks what was most important in the moment — the good outcome when that outweighed the bad, and vice versa.<br />
<strong>A new place to look, and to tweak</strong><br />
The results point to several broader conclusions, Chen said. Perhaps most important, other researchers now have a place to look — the PVT — when they want to study how paying attention to different details affects how and what animals learn.<br />
Neuroscientists also now have a new way to control learning, Chen said. In additional experiments with mice genetically modified so the team could control PVT activity with light, the researchers found they could inhibit or enhance learning — for example, they could more quickly teach mice that an odor no longer reliably signaled water was coming, or that another odor had switched from signaling water to signaling a shock.<br />
Those results could point to new ways to modulate learning — in mice, for the time being — by stimulating or suppressing PVT activity as appropriate. They also point, in the long run, to ways to help treat drug addiction, Chen said, by helping addicts unlearn the association between taking a drug and the subsequent high.</li>

<p>In addition, the study shows that the beneficial effects of training in the brain and intelligence are greater when an educator implement a coaching strategy design in order to help the child understand their training process.</p>
<p>The training program has been developed by researchers from the UGR, and consists of exercises based on experimental paradigms that activates brain areas responsible for the regulation and control of attention. These are activities that are performed on the computer or tablet, and requires focusing attention and respond attentively to situations in which the dominant responses are not correct. Other exercises require keeping the instructions in memory and adapting to changing rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of this research suggest that it is important to educate attention from early childhood,&quot; explains the lead author of this work, the researcher at the Experimental Psychology Department of the University of Granada María Rosario Rueda Cuerva.</p>
<p>In addition, they indicate that the most effective strategies are those in which the educator helps the child to reflect on his or her learning process. &quot;Through the education of attention we can improve the intelligence of children and prepare them for formal learning in school,&quot; says the researcher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Interventions including social scaffolding and metacognitive strategies have been used in educational settings to promote cognition. In addition, increasing evidence shows that computerized process‐based training enhances cognitive skills. However, no prior studies have examined the effect of combining these two training strategies. The goal of this study was to test the combined effect of metacognitive scaffolding and computer‐based training of executive attention in a sample of typically developing preschoolers at the cognitive and brain levels. Compared to children in the regular training protocol and an untrained active control group, children in the metacognitive group showed larger gains on intelligence and significant increases on an electrophysiological index associated with conflict processing. Moreover, changes in the conflict‐related brain activity predicted gains in intelligence in the metacognitive scaffolding group. These results suggest that metacognitive scaffolding boosts the influence of process‐based training on cognitive efficiency and brain plasticity related to executive attention.</p>

<p>many factors intervene between what people actually know, and how they respond based on that knowledge. These factors are known to include the level of attention allocated to external stimuli, the interpretation of sensory information, as well as complex decision processes. All these factors impact how people respond to stimuli they see. However, these factors do not impact anticipatory movements, and the authors examined whether it is possible to determine what people know, and how they learn, by studying only anticipatory behaviors. Their findings suggest that anticipatory behavior may in certain cases be more informative about learning. These results open future developments for studying learning in populations that demonstrate non-reliable responses to external stimulus, such as young children or individuals suffering from physical or mental disorders, for whom it may be more difficult to assess the degree of attention and understanding.</p>
<p>The study</p>
<p>How is possible to know if one is learning and assimilating useful information? The novel answer suggested by the study is that it is useful to observe preparatory, unconscious eye movements, because these offer a window into the process of learning. In the experiment performed, the researchers collected data using an eye-tracker, a device that allows to measure our gaze direction. &quot;We presented volunteers with series of images that were presented on the left or right side of the screen, according to a specific, learnable pattern,&quot; Notaro explains: &quot;We observed how fast people were to look at those images, depending on whether the images were presented at an unexpected or expected location. Surprisingly, the position of the eyes before the next image was presented was biased towards the expected position of the next image. This was a very small eye movement that turned out to be highly informative. It let us infer that the brain can prepare in advance, once an information is learnt. This allows to isolate a mental state that holds before obtaining the 'usual' responses that are triggered by external stimuli (such as verbal answers or button presses).&quot;</p>
<p>Application scenarios</p>
<p>These findings open potential application scenarios, including in the areas of education and health, and particularly in relation to populations with attention or communication deficits. &quot;The presence of these anticipatory signals -- Hasson adds -- provides us with an opportunity to measure attentive capacity and learning with greater precision. These are tiny signals that very likely reflect unconscious processes. At the same time, they are highly reliable, and allow us to forecast how participants may respond to stimuli. The inter-relations of learning and prediction is a topic that arouses much interest transversely, not only in the scientific community, and it touches on areas that may be very close to our daily life. For example, there are already large investments made today in areas such as online advertisement and entertainment that aim to study people's eye movements and how those forecast behavior and memory. Identifying an anticipatory signature in eye movements can advance those areas as well.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> A core question underlying neurobiological and computational models of behavior is how individuals learn environmental statistics and use them to make predictions. Most investigations of this issue have relied on reactive paradigms, in which inferences about predictive processes are derived by modeling responses to stimuli that vary in likelihood. Here we deployed a novel anticipatory oculomotor metric to determine how input statistics impact anticipatory behavior that is decoupled from target-driven-response. We implemented transition constraints between target locations, so that the probability of a target being presented on the same side as the previous trial was 70% in one condition (pret70) and 30% in the other (pret30). Rather than focus on responses to targets, we studied subtle endogenous anticipatory fixation offsets (AFOs) measured while participants fixated the screen center, awaiting a target. These AFOs were small (&lt;0.4° from center on average), but strongly tracked global-level statistics. Speaking to learning dynamics, trial-by-trial fluctuations in AFO were well-described by a learning model, which identified a lower learning rate in pret70 than pret30, corroborating prior suggestions that pret70 is subjectively treated as more regular. Most importantly, direct comparisons with saccade latencies revealed that AFOs: (a) reflected similar temporal integration windows, (b) carried more information about the statistical context than did saccade latencies, and (c) accounted for most of the information that saccade latencies also contained about inputs statistics. Our work demonstrates how strictly predictive processes reflect learning dynamics, and presents a new direction for studying learning and prediction.</p>

<li>ability to learn is contagious.</li>
<li>it is often down to luck whether we meet a teacher who can help us learn certain things, like maths, and how far we can go is often limited by how far a teacher can aid us in our particular journey. but once, and if, we grow beyond this, to finding out things ourselves, it is our internalised spells that decide our fate. it is rare to get to this state, even rarer to dismantle and choose our internal spells.</li>

<li>there are hard limits to what we can do, which are not normally under our control. those limits are the things which we do not (individually) know. they are the weak links in the chain, the holes in our nets, because we do not know they exist.</li>

<li>the limits of our ability to understand and deal with reality are starkly exposed. equal–opportunity–limits.</li>

<li>it depends on where you apply the effort. if you apply the effort once you have neared mastery of the initial skill, then the effort applied will likely gain you a better return on the new skill than on the old. in any case your brain will likely be unable not to reinforce the old skill while you are learning the new.
<ul>
<li>this is how it is possible to be great at many things, not just a few.</li>

<p>ego depletion is nothing of the sort. besides evidence that non glucose stimulation at the point of “depletion” can revive the subject, it may not even be the question of glucose depletion versus mental depletion.</p>
<p>it may instead be the difference between our habits and changing them. when we spend time doing strange new things or actively changing habits, tendency towards the mean or tendency towards equilibrium would suggest that the next action would be a habitual one rather than another change of habit. so it may be that the key to increase level of performance is to accumulate better general habits and review and maintain them.</p>

<li>trust in your ability to learn. when using an srs (spaced repetition system), do not beat yourself up if you do not remember something perfectly, it will come with time and exposure, when we continue with practice. like all tools, if we use it in one of the ways in which it works well, we can get good results.</li>
<li>for me it simulates immersion, in a focused way which concentrates on the topics I have a wish to remember and have chosen to learn, but which prompts and jogs memory at close to the time I was about to forget. in this way, eventually I build a memory for these particular topics which is easily recalled.</li>
<li>most people start off wanting to learn, until someone they trust tells them they shouldn't.</li>

<li>because they are stuck in the logic of their current position, they can’t yet learn to change their opinion on a topic. this is the crux of the issue and also of how we learn and change and grow.</li>
<li>is this the process which becomes more difficult as we become older? not the learning itself but the removal of the baggage, the conscious logical structures we have built up through long experience is more and more consuming the energy that could have gone into the process of acceptance?</li>
<li>this is the very same issue as Socrates is held to expose in the Apology: how to help others learn what they do not already know, when they may hold power over you, power that may be abusive and inimical?</li>
<li>currently, thinking is about conscious thinking in our society, not about thinking which cannot be described or transmitted in words. is it possible to improve that kind of thinking that we cannot describe? I believe it is not only possible but imperative to do so</li>

<li>if time is our ultimate constraint then knowledge is one of the releases from it — knowledge does not always need to be gathered by each person on their own, it can be passed (partially) from person to person at a fraction of the cost of gathering it ourselves, and in the process builds conceptual frameworks we could not otherwise raise on our own</li>

<li>it isn't that everyone needs to achieve mastery of something. it is that when we do achieve mastery of something, we learn many things along the way that help us in our journey. in learning the piano, mostly on my own in a room, I learned, among other things, to: focus; move rapidly and precisely in near–darkness; vary goals to create and maintain challenge and progress; let go conscious thought and let action flow; slow breathing; express delicate and raw emotion; persist; listen to bodily reaction to know when something was as intended; extrapolate from sparse data; act without needing words; find and apply pattern; aim for long–term and short–term effectiveness; deal with changing conditions and abilities over time…</li>

<li>just as memory is really recreation of an event, malleable each time it is recalled, so too is learning — learning is a malleable process, it is a recreation of a process, which changes each time someone learns something from someone else or internally.</li>
<li>learning is taking in reality and adjusting own internal reality to match. we are all innately able to learn but often abusive habits get in the way. like not truly seeing reality, but instead only our interpretation of it — only what matches our expectations or worldview. major corrective ability is the ability to question our own reality — does it correspond well with reality or not? when this ability is obstructed, then our internal world slips further and further from reality. abusive people know to increase this obstruction.</li>
<li>learning seems to be about recognising patterns, that we can use when meeting similar situations in future. for example, words, maths, communication; cycling, running, singing; evolution, diversity, thriving. it is all about removing the illusions that we hold about how well we can do something, learning new patterns that fit reality as it currently is, so that we can do things as well as we all really can.</li>
<li>ideas are the way they are because they haven’t gotten further yet, not because they are true. we do the best we can with what we have at this moment.</li>
