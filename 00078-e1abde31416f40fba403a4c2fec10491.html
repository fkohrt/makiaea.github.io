<p><em>methotrexate chemotherapy induces persistent tri-glial dysregulation that underlies chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment</em><br />

<p>Chemo brain is becoming more common as cancer therapies increasingly allow patients to live many years beyond their diagnoses. There are 15.5 million cancer survivors alive today in the United States, a figure expected to reach 20 million by 2026, according to the National Cancer Institute. But the cognitive side effects of cancer treatment can be debilitating and prolonged: Adults may be unable to return to work, and children often struggle in school.</p>
<p>&quot;It's wonderful that they're alive, but their quality of life is really suffering,&quot; said the study's lead author, Erin Gibson, PhD, a research scientist at Stanford. &quot;If we can do anything to improve that, there is a huge population that could benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientists have long known that drugs like methotrexate impair all of the body's rapidly dividing cells, but how such drugs affect the function of brain cells has been poorly understood.</p>
<p>&quot;Cognitive dysfunction after cancer therapy is a real and recognized syndrome,&quot; said Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences and the study's senior author. &quot;In addition to existing symptomatic therapies -- which many patients don't know about -- we are now homing in on potential interventions to promote normalization of the disorders induced by cancer drugs. There's real hope that we can intervene, induce regeneration and prevent damage in the brain.&quot;</p>
<p>Chemo brain is especially severe in childhood cancer patients, Monje added, and children have the most to gain from better remedies.</p>
<p>Inside the white matter</p>
<p>In addition to neurons, which transmit nerve impulses, the brain's white matter contains other cells that help the neurons function. The research focused on three types of those cells: oligodendrocytes, which produce and maintain myelin, the fatty insulating sheath around nerve fibers; astrocytes, which link neurons to their blood supply, promote proper connections between neurons and maintain the neurons' environment; and microglia, immune cells that can engulf and destroy foreign invaders in the brain, as well as sculpt neural circuitry.</p>
<p>Comparing postmortem frontal lobe brain tissue from children who had and had not received chemotherapy, the researchers showed that there were far fewer oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the brains of the chemotherapy-treated children.</p>
<p>To figure out what was happening to these cells, the researchers injected young mice with methotrexate at levels designed to replicate human exposures during cancer treatment. The mice received three doses at weekly intervals. Four weeks later, the researchers compared the mice's brains to those of mice that had not received the drug.</p>
<p>Methotrexate chemotherapy was found to damage the brain's populations of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Normally, these cells can quickly divide to replace any that are lost, but after methotrexate was administered, this self-renewal process did not happen correctly. More precursor cells than normal were starting down the path of maturation to oligodendrocytes, but they were getting stuck in an intermediate, immature state. The same problem was seen in mouse brains six months after methotrexate was administered.</p>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy of the mouse brains after methotrexate administration revealed deficiencies in the thickness of the myelin insulation around nerve fibers, similar to changes in the brains of humans who have received chemotherapy. Mice exposed to methotrexate also exhibited behavioral problems after four weeks that were similar to humans with chemo brain, including motor impairment (slower movement of their forepaws), signs of anxiety on an &quot;open field&quot; test used to assess how threatened the animal feels in an unsheltered environment, and impaired attention and short-term memory function, evidenced by the inability to discern between novel and familiar objects -- a symptom that persisted for six months after methotrexate was given.</p>
<p>The researchers injected oligodendrocyte precursor cells from healthy animals into the brains of animals that had received methotrexate to see if the cells' maturation problems were caused by some aspect of the brain environment after chemotherapy. The precursor cells still began maturing at higher-than-normal rates but did not get stuck partway through the maturation process, indicating that the brain environment was partly responsible for the cells' abnormal maturation.</p>
<p>Microglial activation</p>
<p>Further study showed that microglia, the brain's immune cells, were persistently activated after methotrexate exposure for at least six months. The activated microglia caused problems for astrocytes, the cells that help neurons get nutrients and function properly. Administering a drug that selectively depleted microglia to mice that had been treated with methotrexate reversed many of the cognitive symptoms of chemo brain and reversed the abnormalities in maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, activation of astrocytes and myelin thickness.</p>
<p>&quot;The biology of this disease really underscores how important intercellular crosstalk is,&quot; Monje said. &quot;Every major neural cell type is affected in this pathophysiology.&quot; She suspects this type of complex dysfunction may also underlie other cognitive disorders. &quot;I think that is probably more the rule than the exception,&quot; she said.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •Chemotherapy depletes oligodendrocyte lineage (OL) cells in humans<br />
•Methotrexate chemotherapy disrupts OL dynamics, myelin, and cognition in mice<br />
•Methotrexate induces chronic microglial activation and astrocyte reactivity<br />
•Microglial depletion rescues glial cell dysregulation and cognitive deficits</p>
<p>Chemotherapy results in a frequent yet poorly understood syndrome of long-term neurological deficits. Neural precursor cell dysfunction and white matter dysfunction are thought to contribute to this debilitating syndrome. Here, we demonstrate persistent depletion of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in humans who received chemotherapy. Developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapy-induced neurological dysfunction, we find a similar depletion of white matter OPCs, increased but incomplete OPC differentiation, and a persistent deficit in myelination. OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy. These findings indicate that methotrexate chemotherapy exposure is associated with persistent tri-glial dysregulation and identify inflammatory microglia as a therapeutic target to abrogate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.</p>

<p><em>mandrills use olfaction to socially avoid parasitized conspecifics</em><br />
clémence poirotte et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>The evolutionary transition from a solitary to a social lifestyle entails an elevated parasite cost because the social proximity associated with group living favors parasite transmission. Despite this cost, sociality is widespread in a large range of taxonomic groups. In this context, hosts would be expected to have evolved behavioral mechanisms to reduce the risk of parasite infection. Few empirical studies have focused on the influence of pathogen-mediated selection on the evolution of antiparasitic behavior in wild vertebrates. We report an adaptive functional relationship between parasitism and social behavior in mandrills, associated with evidence that they are able to gauge parasite status of their group members. Using long-term observations, controlled experiments, and chemical analyses, we show that (i) wild mandrills avoid grooming conspecifics infected with orofecally transmitted parasites; (ii) mandrills receive significantly more grooming after treatment that targets these parasites; (iii) parasitism influences the host’s fecal odors; and (iv) mandrills selectively avoid fecal material from parasitized conspecifics. These behavioral adaptations reveal that selecting safe social partners may help primates to cope with parasite-mediated costs of sociality and that “behavioral immunity” plays a crucial role in the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their parasites.</li>

<p><em>infectious virus in exhaled breath of symptomatic seasonal influenza cases from a college community</em><br />

<li>Lack of human data on influenza virus aerosol shedding fuels debate over the importance of airborne transmission. We provide overwhelming evidence that humans generate infectious aerosols and quantitative data to improve mathematical models of transmission and public health interventions. We show that sneezing is rare and not important for—and that coughing is not required for—influenza virus aerosolization. Our findings, that upper and lower airway infection are independent and that fine-particle exhaled aerosols reflect infection in the lung, opened a pathway for a deeper understanding of the human biology of influenza infection and transmission. Our observation of an association between repeated vaccination and increased viral aerosol generation demonstrated the power of our method, but needs confirmation.</li>

<p><em>human endogenous retrovirus-k hml-2 integration within rasgrf2 is associated with intravenous drug abuse and modulates transcription in a cell-line model</em><br />
timokratis karamitros et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811940115">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811940115</a></p>
<ul>
<li>HERV-K HML-2 (HK2) has been proliferating in the germ line of humans at least as recently as 250,000 years ago, with some integrations that remain polymorphic in the modern human population. One of the solitary HK2 LTR polymorphic integrations lies between exons 17 and 18 of <em>RASGRF2</em>, a gene that affects dopaminergic activity and is thus related to addiction. Here we show that this antisense HK2 integration (namely RASGRF2-int) is found more frequently in persons who inject drugs compared with the general population. In a Greek HIV-1–positive population (<em>n</em> = 202), we found RASGRF2-int 2.5 times (14 versus 6%) more frequently in patients infected through i.v. drug use compared with other transmission route controls (<em>P</em> = 0.03). Independently, in a United Kingdom-based hepatitis C virus-positive population (<em>n</em> = 184), we found RASGRF2-int 3.6 times (34 versus 9.5%) more frequently in patients infected during chronic drug abuse compared with controls (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001). We then tested whether RASGRF2-int could be mechanistically responsible for this association by modulating transcription of <em>RASGRF2</em>. We show that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion of HK2 in HEK293 cells in the exact <em>RASGRF2</em> intronic position found in the population resulted in significant transcriptional and phenotypic changes. We also explored mechanistic features of other intronic HK2 integrations and show that HK2 LTRs can be responsible for generation of <em>cis</em>-natural antisense transcripts, which could interfere with the transcription of nearby genes. Our findings suggest that RASGRF2-int is a strong candidate for dopaminergic manipulation, and emphasize the importance of accurate mapping of neglected HERV polymorphisms in human genomic studies.</li>

<li>It is widely accepted that aging is accompanied by remodelling of the immune system including thymic atrophy and increased frequency of senescent T cells, leading to immune compromise. However, physical activity, which influences immunity but declines dramatically with age, is not considered in this literature. We assessed immune profiles in 125 adults (55–79 years) who had maintained a high level of physical activity (cycling) for much of their adult lives, 75 age-matched older adults and 55 young adults not involved in regular exercise. The frequency of naïve T cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were both higher in cyclists compared with inactive elders, and RTE frequency in cyclists was no different to young adults. Compared with their less active counterparts, the cyclists had significantly higher serum levels of the thymoprotective cytokine IL-7 and lower IL-6, which promotes thymic atrophy. Cyclists also showed additional evidence of reduced immunesenescence, namely lower Th17 polarization and higher B regulatory cell frequency than inactive elders. Physical activity did not protect against all aspects of immunesenescence: CD28−veCD57+ve senescent CD8 T-cell frequency did not differ between cyclists and inactive elders. We conclude that many features of immunesenescence may be driven by reduced physical activity with age.</li>

<p><em>properties of the vastus lateralis muscle in relation to age and physiological function in master cyclists aged 55-79 years</em><br />

<li>In this study, results are reported from the analyses of <em>vastus lateralis</em> muscle biopsy samples obtained from a subset (<em>n</em> = 90) of 125 previously phenotyped, highly active male and female cyclists aged 55–79 years in regard to age. We then subsequently attempted to uncover associations between the findings in muscle and in vivo physiological functions. Muscle fibre type and composition (ATPase histochemistry), size (morphometry), capillary density (immunohistochemistry) and mitochondrial protein content (Western blot) in relation to age were determined in the biopsy specimens. Aside from an age-related change in capillary density in males (<em>r</em> = −.299; <em>p</em> = .02), no other parameter measured in the muscle samples showed an association with age. However, in males type I fibres and capillarity (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) were significantly associated with training volume, maximal oxygen uptake, oxygen uptake kinetics and ventilatory threshold. In females, the only association observed was between capillarity and training volume (<em>p</em> &lt; .05). In males, both type II fibre proportion and area (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) were associated with peak power during sprint cycling and with maximal rate of torque development during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Mitochondrial protein content was not associated with any cardiorespiratory parameter in either males or females (<em>p</em> &gt; .05). We conclude in this highly active cohort, selected to mitigate most of the effects of inactivity, that there is little evidence of age-related changes in the properties of VL muscle across the age range studied. By contrast, some of these muscle characteristics were correlated with in vivo physiological indices.</li>

<p><em>the association between neonatal vitamin d status and risk of schizophrenia</em><br />

<p>newborns with vitamin D deficiency had a 44 per cent increased risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia as adults compared to those with normal vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Schizophrenia is a group of poorly understood brain disorders characterised by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and cognitive impairment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the developing fetus is totally reliant on the mother's vitamin D stores, our findings suggest that ensuring pregnant women have adequate levels of vitamin D may result in the prevention of some schizophrenia cases, in a manner comparable to the role folate supplementation has played in the prevention of spina bifida.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor McGrath, of UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, said the study, which was based on 2602 individuals, confirmed a previous study he led that also found an association between neonatal vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The team made the discovery by analysing vitamin D concentration in blood samples taken from Danish newborns between 1981 and 2000 who went on to develop schizophrenia as young adults.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the samples to those of people matched by sex and date of birth who had not developed schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Professor McGrath said schizophrenia is associated with many different risk factors, both genetic and environmental, but the research suggested that neonatal vitamin D deficiency could possibly account for about eight per cent of schizophrenia cases in Denmark.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of the attention in schizophrenia research has been focused on modifiable factors early in life with the goal of reducing the burden of this disease,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous research identified an increased risk of schizophrenia associated with being born in winter or spring and living in a high-latitude country, such as Denmark.</p>
<p>&quot;We hypothesised that low vitamin D levels in pregnant women due to a lack of sun exposure during winter months might underlie this risk, and investigated the association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of schizophrenia.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor McGrath said that although Australia had more bright sunshine compared to Denmark, vitamin D deficiency could still be found in pregnant women in Australia because of our lifestyle and sun-safe behaviour.</p>
<p>Professor McGrath, who holds a Niels Bohr Professorship at Aarhus University, also led a 2016 Dutch study that found a link between prenatal vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of childhood autism traits.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is to conduct randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplements in pregnant women who are vitamin D deficient, in order to examine the impact on child brain development and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Clues from the epidemiology of schizophrenia, such as the increased risk in those born in winter/spring, have led to the hypothesis that prenatal vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of later schizophrenia. We wish to explore this hypothesis in a large Danish case-control study (n = 2602). The concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was assessed from neonatal dried blood samples. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated when examined for quintiles of 25OHD concentration. In addition, we examined statistical models that combined 25OHD concentration and the schizophrenia polygenic risk score (PRS) in a sample that combined the new sample with a previous study (total n = 3464; samples assayed and genotyped between 2008-2013). Compared to the reference (fourth) quintile, those in the lowest quintile (&lt;20.4 nmol/L) had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia (IRR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.12–1.85). None of the other quintile comparisons were significantly different. There was no significant interaction between 25OHD and the PRS. Neonatal vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia in later life. These findings could have important public health implications related to the primary prevention of schizophrenia.</p>

<li>It is well-established that vitamin D, a fat-soluble pro- hormone, is essential in maintaining calcium homeo- stasis and bone health (1). Beyond its skeletal effects, vi- tamin D has a broad role in human health (2). Vitamin D receptors have since been found in many organs and tis- sues, including those of the cardiovascular, digestive, im- mune, and reproductive systems (1). Inadequate vitamin D has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, autoim- mune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and adverse reproduc- tive outcomes (3, 4).<br />
Numerous factors influence vitamin D status in hu- mans, including those related to sun exposure (eg, sun- screen use, latitude, season, etc) as well as race, age, obesity, and several chronic diseases (5). Recent epidemi- ological research suggests that environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may also play a role by altering levels of the circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Data from available hu- man health studies have shown inverse associations be- tween levels of 25(OH)D, the biomarker of vitamin D status in humans, and exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides (6) and polychlorinated biphenyls (7). Studies assessing the extent to which other widely used industrial chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), influence levels of 25(OH)D are scarce.<br />
Phthalates and BPA are high-production chemicals found in numerous industrial and consumer products and have been detected extensively in the U.S. general popu- lation (8–10). Both agents are known endocrine disrup- tors, and they have been shown to alter sex steroid and thyroid hormone levels at multiple points along these hor- monal axes, including at the nuclear receptors (11–14). Because the molecular structure of the active vitamin D metabolite (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]) is similar to that of classic steroid hormones (1) and its nu- clear receptor is within the same superfamily of proteins as steroid and thyroid hormone receptors (15), it is plausible that these environmental chemicals may also exert a broad range of actions on the vitamin D endocrine system (16). For example, whereas the specific biological mechanisms remain unknown, phthalates and BPA may influence 25(OH)D levels by acting directly on the vitamin D nu- clear receptor or on the metabolic activity of enzymes in- volved in converting vitamin D to its active metabolite. Similar pathways have been suggested for the actions of these chemicals on other hormonal systems involved in the regulation of steroid and thyroid hormones (16–18). In the only study assessing these associations to date, an in- verse correlation was observed between serum BPA and 25(OH)D in participants of a study designed to assess certain risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<br />
(19). However, this investigation was limited by sample size, exposure assessment methods, and lack of statistical consideration for confounding variables in the association of interest. Similar studies on phthalates have not been conducted.<br />
Currently, there are no published data on the relation- ships between phthalate and BPA exposure and circulat- ing total 25(OH)D in the U.S. general population. Herein, we investigated these associations in a representative sam- ple of U.S. adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010.</li>

<p><em>estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin d in adolescents aged 14-18 y: a dose-response, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Background: Adolescents are a population group at high risk of low vitamin D status, yet the evidence base for establishing dietary vitamin D requirements remains weak.<br />
Objective: The aim was to establish the distribution of vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above proposed cutoffs (25, 30, 40, and 50 nmol/L) during winter in white males and females (14–18 y of age) in the United Kingdom (51°N).<br />
Design: In a dose-response trial, 110 adolescents (aged 15.9 ± 1.4 y; 43% males) were randomly assigned to receive 0, 10, or 20 μg vitamin D3 supplements/d for 20 wk during winter. A nonlinear regression model was fit to total vitamin D intake and postintervention serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and regression-predicted values estimated the vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above specific cutoffs.<br />
Results: Mean ± SD serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from 49.2 ± 12.0 to 56.6 ± 12.4 nmol/L and from 51.7 ± 13.4 to 63.9 ± 10.6 nmol/L in the 10- and 20-μg/d groups, respectively, and decreased in the placebo group from 46.8 ± 11.4 to 30.7 ± 8.6 nmol/L (all P ≤ 0.001). Vitamin D intakes required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25 and &gt;30 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents were estimated to be 10.1 and 13.1 μg/d, respectively, and 6.6 μg/d to maintain 50% of adolescents at concentrations &gt;40 nmol/L. Because the response of 25(OH)D reached a plateau at 46 nmol/L, there is uncertainty in estimating the vitamin D intake required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;50 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents, but it exceeded 30 μg/d.<br />
Conclusion: Vitamin D intakes between 10 and ∼30 μg/d are required by white adolescents during winter to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25–50 nmol/L, depending on the serum 25(OH)D threshold chosen. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02150122 and as International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN40736890.</li>

<p><em>the relation of magnesium and calcium intakes and a genetic polymorphism in the magnesium transporter to colorectal neoplasia risk</em><br />

<p>The study reported in the December issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition is important because of controversial findings from ongoing research into the association of vitamin D levels with colorectal cancer and other diseases, including a recent report from the VITAL trial. It gave confirmation to a prior observational study in 2013 by the researchers that linked low magnesium levels with low vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>The trial also revealed something new -- that magnesium had a regulating effect in people with high vitamin D levels. The research provides the first evidence that magnesium may play an important role in optimizing vitamin D levels and preventing conditions related to vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>Qi Dai, MD, PhD, Ingram Professor of Cancer Research, the study's lead author, described the ideal level as being in the middle range of a U-shape because vitamin D at this level has been linked to the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease in previous observational studies.</p>
<p>However, vitamin D was not related to cardiovascular disease in the recent VITAL trial. He and Martha Shrubsole, PhD, research professor of Medicine, Division of Epidemiology, are investigating the role that magnesium may play with cancer as part of the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of information being debated about the relationship between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk that is based upon observational studies versus clinical trials,&quot; Shrubsole said. &quot;The information is mixed thus far.&quot;</p>
<p>They became interested in a role for magnesium because people synthesize vitamin D differently with levels of the vitamin in some individuals not rising even after being given high dosage supplements.</p>
<p>&quot;Magnesium deficiency shuts down the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway,&quot; Dai said.</p>
<p>The randomized study involved 250 people considered at risk for developing colorectal cancer because of either risk factors or having a precancerous polyp removed. Doses of magnesium and placebo were customized based on baseline dietary intake.</p>
<p>&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency is something that has been recognized as a potential health problem on a fairly large scale in the U.S.,&quot; Shrubsole said. &quot;A lot of people have received recommendations from their health care providers to take vitamin D supplements to increase their levels based upon their blood tests. In addition to vitamin D, however, magnesium deficiency is an under-recognized issue. Up to 80 percent of people do not consume enough magnesium in a day to meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) based on those national estimates.&quot;</p>
<p>Shrubsole stressed that the magnesium levels in the trial were in line with RDA guidelines, and she recommended dietary changes as the best method for increasing intake. Foods with high levels of magnesium include dark leafy greens, beans, whole grains, dark chocolate, fatty fish such as salmon, nuts and avocados.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Background: Mean magnesium intake in the US population does not differ from that in East Asian populations with traditionally low risks of colorectal cancer and other chronic diseases, but the ratio of calcium to magnesium (Ca:Mg) intake is much higher in the US population. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a newly found gene essential to magnesium absorption and homeostasis.</p>
<p>Objective: We aimed to test whether the association of colorectal polyps with intake of calcium, magnesium, or both and Thr1482Ile polymorphism in the TRPM7 gene is modified by the Ca:Mg intake.</p>
<p>Design: Included in the study were a total of 688 adenoma cases, 210 hyperplastic polyp cases, and 1306 polyp-free controls from the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study.</p>
<p>Results: We found that total magnesium consumption was linked to a significantly lower risk of colorectal adenoma, particularly in those subjects with a low Ca:Mg intake. An inverse association trend was found for hyperplastic polyps. We also found that the common Thr1482Ile polymorphism was associated with an elevated risk of both adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Moreover, this polymorphism significantly interacted with the Ca:Mg intake in relation to both adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. The subjects who carried ≥1 1482Ile allele and who consumed diets with a high Ca:Mg intake were at a higher risk of adenoma (odds ratio: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.29) and hyperplastic polyps (odds ratio: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.14) than were the subjects who did not carry the polymorphism.</p>
<p>Conclusion: These findings, if confirmed, may provide a new avenue for the personalized prevention of magnesium deficiency and, thus, colorectal cancer.</p>

<p><em>emergence and spread of basal lineages of yersinia pestis during the neolithic decline</em><br />

<p>To better understand the evolutionary history of the plague, Rasmussen and his colleagues trawled through publicly available genetic data from ancient humans, screening for sequences similar to more modern plague strains. They found a strain they had never seen before in the genetic material of a 20-year-old woman who died approximately 5,000 years ago in Sweden. The strain had the same genes that make the pneumonic plague deadly today and traces of it were also found in another individual at the same grave site -- suggesting that the young woman did likely die of the disease.</p>
<p>This strain of the plague is the oldest that's ever been discovered. But what makes it particularly interesting is that, by comparing it to other strains, the researchers were able to determine that it's also the most basal -- meaning that it's the closest strain we have to the genetic origin of Y. pestis. It likely diverged from other strains around 5,700 years ago, while the plague that was common in the Bronze Age and the plague that is the ancestor of the strains in existence today diverged 5,300 and 5,100 years ago, respectively. This suggests that there were multiple strains of plague in existence at the end of the Neolithic period.</p>
<p>Rasmussen also believes that this finding offers a new theory about how plague spreads. Massive human migrations from the Eurasian steppe down into Europe are known to have occurred around 5,000 years ago, but how these cultures were able to displace the Neolithic farming culture that was present in Europe at the time is still debated. Previous researchers have suggested that the invaders brought the plague with them, wiping out the large settlements of Stone Age farmers when they arrived.</p>
<p>But if the strain of plague the researchers found in the Swedish woman diverged from the rest of Y. pestis 5,700 years ago, that means it likely evolved before these migrations began and around the time that the Neolithic European settlements were already starting to collapse.</p>
<p>At the time, mega-settlements of 10,000-20,000 inhabitants were becoming common in Europe, which made job specialization, new technology, and trade possible. But they also may have been the breeding ground for plague. &quot;These mega-settlements were the largest settlements in Europe at that time, ten times bigger than anything else. They had people, animals, and stored food close together, and, likely, very poor sanitation. That's the textbook example of what you need to evolve new pathogens,&quot; says Rasmussen.</p>
<p>&quot;We think our data fit. If plague evolved in the mega-settlements, then when people started dying from it, the settlements would have been abandoned and destroyed. This is exactly what was observed in these settlements after 5,500 years ago. Plague would also have started migrating along all the trade routes made possible by wheeled transport, which had rapidly expanded throughout Europe in this period,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Eventually, he suggests, the plague would have arrived through these trade interactions at the small settlement in Sweden where the woman his team studied lived. Rasmussen argues that the woman's own DNA also provides further evidence for this theory -- she isn't genetically related to the people who invaded Europe from the Eurasian steppe, supporting the idea that this strain of plague arrived before the mass migrations did. The archaeology also supports this hypothesis, as there were still no signs of the invaders by the time she died.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some limitations to what the data from this study can tell us. Most importantly, the researchers have not yet identified the plague in individuals from the mega-settlements where it may have evolved. &quot;We haven't really found the smoking gun, but it's partly because we haven't looked yet. And we'd really like to do that, because if we could find plague in those settlements, that would be strong support for this theory,&quot; says Rasmussen.</p>
<p>Regardless, he believes that this study is a step toward understanding how plague -- and other pathogens -- became deadly. &quot;We often think that these superpathogens have always been around, but that's not the case,&quot; he says. &quot;Plague evolved from an organism that was relatively harmless. More recently, the same thing happened with smallpox, malaria, Ebola, and Zika. This process is very dynamic -- and it keeps happening. I think it's really interesting to try to understand how we go from something harmless to something extremely virulent.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •Discovery of the most ancient case of plague in humans, 4,900 years ago in Sweden<br />
•Basal lineages of Y. pestis emerged and spread during the Neolithic decline<br />
•Plague infections in distinct Eurasian populations during Neolithic and Bronze Age<br />
•A plague pandemic likely emerged in large settlements and spread over trade routes</p>
<p>Between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, many Neolithic societies declined throughout western Eurasia due to a combination of factors that are still largely debated. Here, we report the discovery and genome reconstruction of Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, in Neolithic farmers in Sweden, pre-dating and basal to all modern and ancient known strains of this pathogen. We investigated the history of this strain by combining phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of the bacterial genome, detailed archaeological information, and genomic analyses from infected individuals and hundreds of ancient human samples across Eurasia. These analyses revealed that multiple and independent lineages of Y. pestis branched and expanded across Eurasia during the Neolithic decline, spreading most likely through early trade networks rather than massive human migrations. Our results are consistent with the existence of a prehistoric plague pandemic that likely contributed to the decay of Neolithic populations in Europe.</p>

<li><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (<em>Mtb</em>) is one of the most ancient human pathogens, yet the exact mechanism(s) of host defense against <em>Mtb</em> remains unclear. Although one-third of the world’s population is chronically infected with <em>Mtb</em>, only 5 to 10% develop active disease. This indicates that, in addition to resistance mechanisms that control bacterial burden, the host has also evolved strategies to tolerate the presence of <em>Mtb</em> to limit disease severity. We identify mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) as a critical checkpoint of T cell metabolism that controls the expansion of activated T cells. Although loss of CypD function in T cells led to enhanced <em>Mtb</em> antigen–specific T cell responses, this increased T cell response had no impact on bacterial burden. Rather, mice containing CypD-deficient T cells exhibited substantially compromised disease tolerance and succumbed to <em>Mtb</em> infection. This study establishes a mechanistic link between T cell–mediated immunity and disease tolerance during <em>Mtb</em> infection.</li>

<li>Running with a forefoot strike (FFS) pattern has been suggested to reduce the risk of overuse running injuries, due to a reduced vertical load rate compared with rearfoot strike (RFS) running. However, resultant load rate has been reported to be similar between foot strikes when running in traditional shoes, leading to questions regarding the value of running with a FFS. The influence of minimal footwear on the resultant load rate has not been considered. This study aimed to compare component and resultant instantaneous loading rate (ILR) between runners with different foot strike patterns in their habitual footwear conditions. Methods: Twenty-nine injury-free participants (22 men, seven women) ran at 3.13 mIs j1 along a 30-m runway, with their habitual foot strike and footwear condition. Ground reaction force data were collected. Peak ILR values were compared between three conditions; those who habitually run with an RFS in standard shoes, with an FFS in standard shoes, and with an FFS in minimal shoes. Results: Peak resultant, vertical, lateral, and medial ILR were lower (P G 0.001) when running in minimal shoes with an FFS than in standard shoes with either foot strike. When running with an FFS, peak posterior ILR were lower (P G 0.001) in minimal than standard shoes. Conclusions: When running in a standard shoe, peak resultant and component ILR were similar between footstrike patterns. However, load rates were lower when running in minimal shoes with a FFS, compared with running in standard shoes with either foot strike. Therefore, it appears that footwear alters the load rates during running, even with similar foot strike patterns.</li>

<li>In developing countries, obesity traditionally affectsmore affluent children, butis spreading to a wider social group. Understanding the perceivedcontributors can provide valuable insights to plan preventive interventions. We exploreddifferences in the perceived causes of childhood obesity between local and migrant communities in a major Chinese city. We conducted 20 focus groups (137 parents, grandparents, school teachers) and 11semi-structured interviews with school Principals from migrant and local communities in Guangzhou. Data were transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach. We found that Lack of influence from grandparents, who were perceived to promote obesogenic behaviorin local children, fewer opportunities for unhealthy snacking and less pressure for academic attainment leading to moreactive play were interpreted as potential “protective” factors among migrant children. Nevertheless, two perceived causes of obesity were more pronounced in migrant than local children: lack of parental monitoring after-school andunsafe neighborhoods limiting physical-activity. Two barriers that restricted child physical activity were only found in the migrant community: limited home space, and cultural differences, inhabitinginteractive play with local children. Future interventions should consider uniquedeterminants of obesity in children from different social backgrounds, with tailored strategies to prevent further rise of the epidemic.</li>

<p><em>macrophage migration inhibitory factor is subjected to glucose modification and oxidation in alzheimer’s disease</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Glucose and glucose metabolites are able to adversely modify proteins through a non-enzymatic reaction called glycation, which is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and is a characteristic of the hyperglycaemia induced by diabetes. However, the precise protein glycation profile that characterises AD is poorly defined and the molecular link between hyperglycaemia and AD is unknown. In this study, we define an early glycation profile of human brain using fluorescent phenylboronate gel electrophoresis and identify early glycation and oxidation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in AD brain. This modification inhibits MIF enzyme activity and ability to stimulate glial cells. MIF is involved in immune response and insulin regulation, hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress and glycation are all implicated in AD. Our study indicates that glucose modified and oxidised MIF could be a molecular link between hyperglycaemia and the dysregulation of the innate immune system in AD.</li>

<p><em>enhanced protein translation underlies improved metabolic and physical adaptations to different exercise training modes in young and old humans</em><br />

<li>
<pre><code>    •High-intensity interval training improved age-related decline in muscle mitochondria  
      •Training adaptations occurred with increased gene transcripts and ribosome proteins  
      •Changes to RNA with training had little overlap with corresponding protein abundance  
      •Enhanced ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis explain gains in mitochondria  
</code></pre>
<p>Summary<br />
The molecular transducers of benefits from different exercise modalities remain incompletely defined. Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein abundance was noted. HIIT reversed many age-related differences in the proteome, particularly of mitochondrial proteins in concert with increased mitochondrial protein synthesis. Both RT and HIIT enhanced proteins involved in translational machinery irrespective of age. Only small changes of methylation of DNA promoter regions were observed. We provide evidence for predominant exercise regulation at the translational level, enhancing translational capacity and proteome abundance to explain phenotypic gains in muscle mitochondrial function and hypertrophy in all ages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Author Summary<br />
<strong>Why Was This Study Done?</strong><br />
Orthostatic hypotension is a common cause of transient cerebral hypoperfusion that is associated with subclinical brain disease, as well as increased risk of stroke.<br />
Hypoperfusion has been implicated in the pathophysiology of dementia, but whether orthostatic hypotension affects the risk of dementia is uncertain.<br />
<strong>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</strong><br />
Back in 1990, we measured orthostatic hypotension in 6,204 community-dwelling individuals participating in the Dutch population-based Rotterdam Study, and we followed these people for occurrence of dementia until 2014.<br />
Having orthostatic hypotension at start of the study increased the risk of developing dementia over the next 25 years by 15%, with similar results for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease.<br />
The risk of dementia was particularly increased when the orthostatic blood pressure drops were not compensated for by a sufficient increase in heart rate.<br />
<strong>What Do These Findings Mean?</strong><br />
These findings suggest that transient cerebral hypoperfusion plays a role in the aetiology of dementia and that further studies are warranted to investigate the effects of hypoperfusion and treatment of orthostatic hypotension on markers of neurodegenerative disease and cognition.</li>

<ul>
<li>Nocturia is the symptom that most affects QOL. However, in this clinical study in which the subjects had nocturia and high salt intake, both nighttime frequency and NPi decreased significantly in the group that succeeded in decreasing salt intake (the S group). Furthermore, QOL improved. For patients with nocturia and high salt intake, it might be better to advise salt intake reduction and lifestyle guidance. Salt intake reduction might also be beneficial for patients who respond poorly to medications for nocturia and who have high salt intake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Astrocytes are active partners in neural information processing [ 1, 2 ]. However, the roles of astrocytes in regulating behavior remain unclear [ 3, 4 ]. Because astrocytes have persistent circadian clock gene expression and ATP release in vitro [ 5–8 ], we hypothesized that they regulate daily rhythms in neurons and behavior. Here, we demonstrated that daily rhythms in astrocytes within the mammalian master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), determine the period of wheel-running activity. Ablating the essential clock gene <em>Bmal1</em> specifically in SCN astrocytes lengthened the circadian period of clock gene expression in the SCN and in locomotor behavior. Similarly, excision of the short-period CK1ε <em>tau</em> mutation specifically from SCN astrocytes resulted in lengthened rhythms in the SCN and behavior. These results indicate that astrocytes within the SCN communicate to neurons to determine circadian rhythms in physiology and in rest activity.</li>

<p><em>characterization of a human-specific tandem repeat associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are highly heritable diseases that affect more than 3% of individuals worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have strongly and repeatedly linked risk for both of these neuropsychiatric diseases to a 100 kb interval in the third intron of the human calcium channel gene <em>CACNA1C</em>. However, the causative mutation is not yet known. We have identified a human-specific tandem repeat in this region that is composed of 30 bp units, often repeated hundreds of times. This large tandem repeat is unstable using standard polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cloning techniques, which may have resulted in its incorrect size in the human reference genome. The large 30-mer repeat region is polymorphic in both size and sequence in human populations. Particular sequence variants of the 30-mer are associated with risk status at several flanking single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the third intron of <em>CACNA1C</em> that have previously been linked to BD and SCZ. The tandem repeat arrays function as enhancers that increase reporter gene expression in a human neural progenitor cell line. Different human arrays vary in the magnitude of enhancer activity, and the 30-mer arrays associated with increased psychiatric disease risk status have decreased enhancer activity. Changes in the structure and sequence of these arrays likely contribute to changes in <em>CACNA1C</em> function during human evolution and may modulate neuropsychiatric disease risk in modern human populations.</li>

<li>•Fasting metabolism is protective in bacterial, but not viral, inflammation<br />
•Ketone bodies limit ROS-induced neuronal damage during bacterial inflammation<br />
•Glucose utilization prevents UPR-mediated neuronal damage during viral inflammation<br />
　<br />
Acute infections are associated with a set of stereotypic behavioral responses, including anorexia, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Although these so-called sickness behaviors are the most common and familiar symptoms of infections, their roles in host defense are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of anorexia in models of bacterial and viral infections. We found that anorexia was protective while nutritional supplementation was detrimental in bacterial sepsis. Furthermore, glucose was necessary and sufficient for these effects. In contrast, nutritional supplementation protected against mortality from influenza infection and viral sepsis, whereas blocking glucose utilization was lethal. In both bacterial and viral models, these effects were largely independent of pathogen load and magnitude of inflammation. Instead, we identify opposing metabolic requirements tied to cellular stress adaptations critical for tolerance of differential inflammatory states.</li>

<p><em>vector competence of aedes aegypti, culex tarsalis, and culex quinquefasciatus from california for zika virus</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged since 2013 as a significant global human health threat following outbreaks in the Pacific Islands and rapid spread throughout South and Central America. Severe congenital and neurological sequelae have been linked to ZIKV infections. Assessing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit ZIKV and characterizing variation in mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important for estimating regional outbreak potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control strategies for <em>Aedes</em> and <em>Culex</em> species. In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, and <em>Culex tarsalis</em> that originated in areas of California where ZIKV cases in travelers since 2015 were frequent. We compared infection, dissemination, and transmission rates by measuring ZIKV RNA levels in cohorts of mosquitoes that ingested blood meals from type I interferon-deficient mice infected with either a Puerto Rican ZIKV strain from 2015 (PR15), a Brazilian ZIKV strain from 2015 (BR15), or an ancestral Asian-lineage Malaysian ZIKV strain from 1966 (MA66). With PR15, <em>Cx</em>. <em>quinquefasciatus</em> was refractory to infection (0%, N = 42) and <em>Cx</em>. <em>tarsalis</em> was infected at 4% (N = 46). No ZIKV RNA was detected in saliva from either <em>Culex</em> species 14 or 21 days post feeding (dpf). In contrast, <em>Ae</em>. <em>aegypti</em> developed infection rates of 85% (PR15; N = 46), 90% (BR15; N = 20), and 81% (MA66; N = 85) 14 or 15 dpf. Although MA66-infected <em>Ae</em>. <em>aegypti</em> showed higher levels of ZIKV RNA in mosquito bodies and legs, transmission rates were not significantly different across virus strains (<em>P</em> = 0.13, Fisher’s exact test). To confirm infectivity and measure the transmitted ZIKV dose, we enumerated infectious ZIKV in <em>Ae</em>. <em>aegypti</em> saliva using Vero cell plaque assays. The expectorated plaque forming units PFU varied by viral strain: MA66-infected expectorated 13±4 PFU (mean±SE, N = 13) compared to 29±6 PFU for PR15-infected (N = 13) and 35±8 PFU for BR15-infected (N = 6; ANOVA, df = 2, F = 3.8, <em>P</em> = 0.035). These laboratory vector competence results support an emerging consensus that <em>Cx</em>. <em>tarsalis</em> and <em>Cx</em>. <em>quinquefasciatus</em> are not vectors of ZIKV. These results also indicate that <em>Ae</em>. <em>aegypti</em> from California are efficient laboratory vectors of ancestral and contemporary Asian lineage ZIKV.</li>

<li>The microorganisms that inhabit hospitals may influence patient recovery and outcome, although the complexity and diversity of these bacterial communities can confound our ability to focus on potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a community-level understanding of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment, we characterized the bacterial dynamics among hospital surfaces, patients, and staff over the course of 1 year as a new hospital became operational. The bacteria in patient rooms, particularly on bedrails, consistently resembled the skin microbiota of the patient occupying the room. Bacterial communities on patients and room surfaces became increasingly similar over the course of a patient’s stay. Temporal correlations in community structure demonstrated that patients initially acquired room-associated taxa that predated their stay but that their own microbial signatures began to influence the room community structure over time. The α- and β-diversity of patient skin samples were only weakly or nonsignificantly associated with clinical factors such as chemotherapy, antibiotic usage, and surgical recovery, and no factor except for ambulatory status affected microbial similarity between the microbiotas of a patient and their room. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes conferring antimicrobial resistance were consistently more abundant on room surfaces than on the skin of the patients inhabiting those rooms. In addition, persistent unique genotypes of <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Propionibacterium</em> were identified. Dynamic Bayesian network analysis suggested that hospital staff were more likely to be a source of bacteria on the skin of patients than the reverse but that there were no universal patterns of transmission across patient rooms.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bacteria within the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em> can be abundant in showerheads, and the inhalation of aerosolized mycobacteria while showering has been implicated as a mode of transmission in nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections. Despite their importance, the diversity, distributions, and environmental predictors of showerhead-associated mycobacteria remain largely unresolved. To address these knowledge gaps, we worked with citizen scientists to collect showerhead biofilm samples and associated water chemistry data from 656 households located across the United States and Europe. Our cultivation-independent analyses revealed that the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em> was consistently the most abundant genus of bacteria detected in residential showerheads, and yet mycobacterial diversity and abundances were highly variable. Mycobacteria were far more abundant, on average, in showerheads receiving municipal water than in those receiving well water and in U.S. households than in European households, patterns that are likely driven by differences in the use of chlorine disinfectants. Moreover, we found that water source, water chemistry, and household location also influenced the prevalence of specific mycobacterial lineages detected in showerheads. We identified geographic regions within the United States where showerheads have particularly high abundances of potentially pathogenic lineages of mycobacteria, and these “hot spots” generally overlapped those regions where NTM lung disease is most prevalent. Together, these results emphasize the public health relevance of mycobacteria in showerhead biofilms. They further demonstrate that mycobacterial distributions in showerhead biofilms are often predictable from household location and water chemistry, knowledge that advances our understanding of NTM transmission dynamics and the development of strategies to reduce exposures to these emerging pathogens.<br />
<strong>IMPORTANCE</strong> Bacteria thrive in showerheads and throughout household water distribution systems. While most of these bacteria are innocuous, some are potential pathogens, including members of the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em> that can cause nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infection, an increasing threat to public health. We found that showerheads in households across the United States and Europe often harbor abundant mycobacterial communities that vary in composition depending on geographic location, water chemistry, and water source, with households receiving water treated with chlorine disinfectants having particularly high abundances of certain mycobacteria. The regions in the United States where NTM lung infections are most common were the same regions where pathogenic mycobacteria were most prevalent in showerheads, highlighting the important role of showerheads in the transmission of NTM infections.</li>

<li>As a bubble’s cap gets thinner, the droplets it will spray out when it inevitably bursts become smaller, faster, and more numerous. The team found that a single bacteria-laden bubble can create 10 times more droplets, which are 10 times smaller and ejected 10 times faster than what a clean bubble can produce. This amounts to hundreds of droplets that measure only a few dozens of microns and that are emitted at speeds of the order of 10 meters per second.</li>

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.255">http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.255</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Objective<br />
To quantify the survival of Clostridium difficile spores on hospital bed sheets through the United Kingdom National Health System (UK NHS) healthcare laundry process (Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-04) in vitro and on bed sheets from patients with C. difficile through the commercial laundry.<br />
Methods<br />
Clostridium difficile spores were inoculated onto cotton sheets and laundered through a simulated washer extractor cycle using an industrial bleach detergent with sodium hypochlorite 15% and peracetic acid sour 14% (acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide; pH, 2–4). Spore survival on hospital sheets naturally contaminated with C. difficile was also assessed using a washer extractor plus drying and finishing cycles at a commercial laundry.<br />
Patients<br />
Naturally contaminated C. difficile bed sheets were taken from beds of patients that had previously been diagnosed with C. difficile infection (CDI) and had received care on an isolated C. difficile ward.<br />
Results<br />
The simulated washer extractor cycle, with an industrial detergent, demonstrated survival of 2 strains of C. difficile NCTC 11209 (0–4 colony-forming units [cfu] per 25 cm2) and ribotype 001/072 (0–9 cfu per 25 cm2). Before laundering, naturally contaminated bed sheets had an average spore load of 51 cfu per 25 cm2, and after washing, drying, and finishing, the spore load was 33 cfu per 25 cm2. Before and after washing, the C. difficile strain was identified as ribotype 001/072. Both the simulated and in-situ laundering processes failed the microbiological standards of no pathogenic bacteria remaining.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Clostridium difficile spores are able to survive laundering through a commercial washer extractor and may be contributing to sporadic outbreaks of CDI. Further research to establish exposure of laundry workers, patients, and the hospital environment to C. difficile spores from bed sheets is needed.</li>

<li><em>abstract</em> Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) outbreaks are mostly attributed to patient-to-patient transmission via healthcare workers.<br />
Objective<br />
We describe successful containment of a prolonged OXA-48–producing S. marcescens outbreak after recognizing the sink traps as the source of transmission.<br />
Methods<br />
The Sheba Medical Center intensive care unit (ICU), contains 16 single-bed, semi-closed rooms. Active CPE surveillance includes twice-weekly rectal screening of all patients. A case was defined as a patient detected with OXA-48 CPE &gt;72 hours after admission. A root-cause analysis was used to investigate the outbreak. All samples were inoculated on chrom-agar CRE, and carbapenemase genes were detected using commercial molecular Xpert-Carba-R. Environmental and patient S. marcescens isolates were characterized using PFGE.<br />
Results<br />
From January 2016 to May 2017, 32 OXA-48 CPE cases were detected, and 81% of these were S. marcescens. A single clone was the cause of all but the first 2 cases. The common factor in all cases was the use of relatively large amounts of tap water. The outbreak clone was detected in 2 sink outlets and 16 sink traps. In addition to routine strict infection control measures, measures taken to contain the outbreak included (1) various sink decontamination efforts, which eliminated the bacteria from the sink drains only temporarily and (2) educational intervention that engaged the ICU team and lead to high adherence to ‘sink-contamination prevention guidelines.’ No additional cases were detected for 12 months.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Despite persistence of the outbreak clones in the environmental reservoir for 1 year, the outbreak was rapidly and successfully contained. Addressing sink traps as hidden reservoirs played a major role in the intervention.</li>

Each acute infectious disease has its own seasonal window of occurrence, which, importantly, may vary among geographic locations and differ from other diseases within the same location. Here we explore the concept of an epidemic calendar, which is the idea that seasonality is a unifying feature of epidemic-prone diseases and, in the absence of control measures, the local calendar can be marked by epidemics (Fig 1). A well-known example of a calendar marked by epidemics is that of the Northern Hemisphere, where influenza outbreaks occur each winter [2, 3] (hence the colloquial reference to winter as “the flu season”). In contrast, chickenpox outbreaks peak each spring [4, 5], and polio transmission historically occurred each summer <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.138065">6</a>.</li>

<p>By comparing Oyster card route information and Public Health England data on flu-like illnesses, Dr Lara Goscé from the University of Bristol's Department of Civil Engineering and Dr Anders Johansson from Bristol's Department of Engineering Mathematics, discovered higher rates of airborne infections in Londoners that have longer tube journeys through busier terminals.</p>
<p>Dr Goscé explained: &quot;Higher rates [of influenza-like cases] can be observed in boroughs served by a small number of underground lines: passengers starting their journey in these boroughs usually have to change lines once or more in crowded junctions such as King's Cross in order to reach their final destination.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, lower influenza-like rates are found in boroughs where either the population do not use public transport as the main form of transport to commute to work; or boroughs served by more underground lines, which guarantee faster trips with less stops and contacts with fewer people.&quot;</p>
<p>For instance, one finding highlighted that infection rates in residents of Islington, who often change lines at crowded Kings Cross St. Pancreas, were nearly three times higher than in commuters from Kensington, who mostly take direct trains.</p>
<p>The team hopes that their findings will inform Government epidemic policies. Dr Goscé said: &quot;Policy makers, in particular, should address the role potentially played by public transport and crowded events and avoid encouraging the attendance of such environments during epidemics.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the group want to draw a clearer map of the spread of cold-like infections in a metropolitan environment, and so plan to combine individual level infection data with existing studies from households and schools.</p>
<p>Dr Goscé said: &quot;These results are preliminary following limitations of the dataset. Empirical studies. Empirical studies combining aero-biology and pedestrian modelling would be important in improving model fidelity and devising non-pharmaceutical control strategies tackling threshold densities to minimise numbers of infections and optimal ventilation in different crowded environments.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Background<br />
The transmission of infectious diseases is dependent on the amount and nature of contacts between infectious and healthy individuals. Confined and crowded environments that people visit in their day-to-day life (such as town squares, business districts, transport hubs, etc) can act as hot-spots for spreading disease. In this study we explore the link between the use of public transport and the spread of airborne infections in urban environments.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We study a large number of journeys on the London Underground, which is known to be particularly crowded at certain times. We use publically available Oyster card data (the electronic ticket used for public transport in Greater London), to infer passengers’ routes on the underground network. In order to estimate the spread of a generic airborne disease in each station, we use and extend an analytical microscopic model that was initially designed to study people moving in a corridor.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Comparing our results with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) data collected by Public Health England (PHE) in London boroughs, shows a correlation between the use of public transport and the spread of ILI. Specifically, we show that passengers departing from boroughs with higher ILI rates have higher number of contacts when travelling on the underground. Moreover, by comparing our results with other demographic key factors, we are able to discuss the role that the Underground plays in the spread of airborne infections in the English capital.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Our study suggests a link between public transport use and infectious diseases transmission and encourages further research into that area. Results could be used to inform the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can act on preventing instead of curing infections and are, potentially, more cost-effective.</p>

<p><em>prion seeding activity and infectivity in skin samples from patients with sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common human prion disease, is transmissible through iatrogenic routes due to abundant infectious prions [misfolded forms of the prion protein (PrPSc)] in the central nervous system (CNS). Some epidemiological studies have associated sCJD risk with non-CNS surgeries. We explored the potential prion seeding activity and infectivity of skin from sCJD patients. Autopsy or biopsy skin samples from 38 patients [21 sCJD, 2 variant CJD (vCJD), and 15 non-CJD] were analyzed by Western blotting and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) for PrPSc. Skin samples from two patients were further examined for prion infectivity by bioassay using two lines of humanized transgenic mice. Western blotting revealed dermal PrPSc in one of five deceased sCJD patients and one of two vCJD patients. However, the more sensitive RT-QuIC assay detected prion seeding activity in skin from all 23 CJD decedents but not in skin from any non-CJD control individuals (with other neurological conditions or other diseases) during blinded testing. Although sCJD patient skin contained ~103- to 105-fold lower prion seeding activity than did sCJD patient brain tissue, all 12 mice from two transgenic mouse lines inoculated with sCJD skin homogenates from two sCJD patients succumbed to prion disease within 564 days after inoculation. Our study demonstrates that the skin of sCJD patients contains both prion seeding activity and infectivity, which raises concerns about the potential for iatrogenic sCJD transmission via skin.</li>

<p><em>bioelectric regulation of innate immune system function in regenerating and intact xenopus laevis</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Two key inputs that regulate regeneration are the function of the immune system, and spatial gradients of transmembrane potential (<em>V</em>mem). Endogenous bioelectric signaling in somatic tissues during regenerative patterning is beginning to be understood, but its role in the context of immune response has never been investigated. Here, we show that <em>V</em>mem levels modulate innate immunity activity in <em>Xenopus laevis</em> embryos. We developed an assay in which <em>X. laevis</em> embryos are infected with a uropathogenic microorganism, in the presence or absence of reagents that modify <em>V</em>mem, prior to the ontogenesis of the adaptive immune system. General depolarization of the organism’s <em>V</em>mem by pharmacological or molecular genetic (ion channel misexpression) methods increased resistance to infection, while hyperpolarization made the embryos more susceptible to death by infection. Hyperpolarized specimens harbored a higher load of infectious microorganisms when compared to controls. We identified two mechanisms by which <em>V</em>mem mediates immune function: serotonergic signaling involving melanocytes and an increase in the number of primitive myeloid cells. Bioinformatics analysis of genes whose transcription is altered by depolarization revealed a number of immune system targets consistent with mammalian data. Remarkably, amputation of the tail bud potentiates systemic resistance to infection by increasing the number of peripheral myeloid cells, revealing an interplay of regenerative response, innate immunity, and bioelectric regulation. Our study identifies bioelectricity as a new mechanism by which innate immune response can be regulated in the context of infection or regeneration. <em>V</em>mem modulation using drugs already approved for human use could be exploited to improve resistance to infections in clinical settings.</li>

<p><em>adaptive capacity: an evolutionary neuroscience model linking exercise, cognition, and brain health</em><br />

<li>The field of cognitive neuroscience was transformed by the discovery that exercise induces neurogenesis in the adult brain, with the potential to improve brain health and stave off the effects of neurodegenerative disease. However, the basic mechanisms underlying exercise–brain connections are not well understood. We use an evolutionary neuroscience approach to develop the adaptive capacity model (ACM), detailing how and why physical activity improves brain function based on an energy-minimizing strategy. Building on studies showing a combined benefit of exercise and cognitive challenge to enhance neuroplasticity, our ACM addresses two fundamental questions: (i) what are the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying age-related brain atrophy, and (ii) how do lifestyle changes influence the trajectory of healthy and pathological aging?<br />
Trends<br />
Recent work has shown that exercise can significantly improve brain structure and function in adults, especially during aging.<br />
We currently lack a comprehensive theoretical model to explain why exercise can lead to improved brain function.<br />
Taking an evolutionary neuroscience approach suggests that physiological systems, including the brain, respond to activity-related stress by expanding capacity, and that reductions in capacity represent an energy-minimizing strategy in response to inactivity.<br />
From an evolutionary neuroscience perspective, physical activity stresses brain function because of the cognitively demanding foraging context in which our ancestors engaged in aerobic physical activity.<br />
The ACM links evolutionary theory with cognitive neuroscience to show that cognitively demanding exercise is beneficial to brain structure and function, and that we can take advantage of this adaptation to help prevent declines due to aging and to developing neurological disease.</li>

<li>In this study, we used insurance claims for over one-third of the entire US population to create a subset of 128,989 families (481,657 unique individuals). We then used these data to (i) estimate the heritability and familial environmental patterns of 149 diseases and (ii) infer the genetic and environmental correlations for disease pairs from a set of 29 complex diseases. The majority (52 of 65) of our study’s heritability estimates matched earlier reports, and 84 of our estimates appear to have been obtained for the first time. We used correlation matrices to compute environmental and genetic disease classifications and corresponding reliability measures. Among unexpected observations, we found that migraine, typically classified as a disease of the central nervous system, appeared to be most genetically similar to irritable bowel syndrome and most environmentally similar to cystitis and urethritis, all of which are inflammatory diseases.</li>

<p><em>26s proteasomes are rapidly activated by diverse hormones and physiological states that raise camp and cause rpn6 phosphorylation</em><br />

<p>intense exercise, fasting and an array of hormones can activate cells' built-in protein disposal system and enhance their ability to purge defective, toxic or unneeded proteins.</p>
<p>The findings, published Feb. 19 in PNAS, reveal a previously unknown mechanism used by the body to rapidly turn on the molecular machinery responsible for junk-protein removal, allowing cells to adapt their protein content to meet new demands. This mechanism, the study shows, is triggered by fluctuations in hormone levels, which signal changes in physiologic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings show that the body has a built-in mechanism for cranking up the molecular machinery responsible for waste-protein removal that is so critical for the cells' ability to adapt to new conditions,&quot; said Alfred Goldberg, senior author on the study and professor of cell biology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Cellular house cleaning in disease and health</p>
<p>Malfunctions in the cells' protein-disposal machinery can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which clog up the cell, interfere with its functions and, over time, precipitate the development of diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS and Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The best-studied biochemical system used by cells to remove junk proteins is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It involves the tagging of defective or unneeded proteins with ubiquitin molecules -- a process known as the &quot;kiss of death,&quot; which marks proteins for destruction by the cell's protein-disposal unit, known as 26S proteasome.</p>
<p>Past research by Goldberg's lab has shown that this machinery can be activated by pharmacological agents that boost the levels of a molecule known as cAMP, an intracellular messenger, which in turn switches on the enzyme protein kinase A.</p>
<p>The team's previous work has shown that cAMP-stimulating drugs enhance the destruction of defective or toxic proteins, particularly mutant proteins that can lead to neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p>The new findings, however, reveal that this quality-control process is continually regulated independent of drugs by shifts in physiological states and corresponding changes in hormones.</p>
<p>Past research, including work from Goldberg's lab, has focused predominantly on reining in overactive protein breakdown -- a state of excessive protein removal that can cause muscle wasting in cancer patients or give rise to several types of muscle atrophy. In fact, a proteasome inhibitor drug that tamps down the activity of the protein-disposal machinery, developed by Goldberg and team, has been widely used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a common type of blood cancer, marked by abnormal protein accumulation and overworked proteasomes.</p>
<p>The team's latest work, by contrast, is focused on developing therapies that do the exact opposite -- invigorate the cell's protein-disposal machinery when it is too sluggish. These newest findings open the door -- at least conceptually -- to precisely such treatments.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe our findings set the stage for the development of therapies that harness the cells' natural ability to dispose of proteins and thus enhance the removal of toxic proteins that cause disease,&quot; said study lead investigator Jordan VerPlank, a postdoctoral research fellow in cell biology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Such treatments, the team said, may not necessarily involve the design of new molecules but instead stimulate the cell's built-in capacity for quality control.</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly a new way of looking at whether we can turn up the cellular vacuum cleaner,&quot; Goldberg said. &quot;We thought this would require the development of new types of molecules, but we hadn't truly appreciated that our cells continually activate this process.</p>
<p>&quot;The beauty and the surprise of it is that such new treatments may involve churning a natural endogenous pathway and harnessing the body's preexisting capacity to perform quality control,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>That exercise has many salutary effects is already well known, the researchers said, but the new findings also hint at the possibility that exercise and fasting could help reduce the risk of developing conditions associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. That possibility, however, remains to be explored in subsequent research, the team noted.</p>
<p>In their experiments, the researchers analyzed the effects of exercise on cells obtained from the thigh muscles of four human volunteers before and after vigorous biking. Following exercise, the proteasomes of these cells showed dramatically more molecular marks of enhanced protein degradation, including greater levels of cAMP, the chemical trigger that initiates the cascade that leads to protein degradation inside cells. The same changes were observed in the muscles of anesthetized rats whose hind legs were stimulated to contract repeatedly.</p>
<p>Fasting -- even for brief periods -- produced a similar effect on the cells' protein-breakdown machinery. Fasting increased proteasome activity in the muscle and liver cells of mice deprived of food for 12 hours -- the equivalent of an overnight fast.</p>
<p>In another round of experiments, the researchers exposed the liver cells of mice to glucagon -- the hormone that stimulates the production of glucose as fuel for cells and tissues during periods of food deprivation or whenever blood sugar levels drop down. The researchers observed that glucagon exposure stimulated proteasome activity and enhanced the cells' capacity to destroy misfolded proteins.</p>
<p>Exposure to the fight-or-flight hormone epinephrine produced a similar effect. Epinephrine, or adrenaline in common parlance, is responsible for stimulating the liver and muscle to mobilize energy reserves to boost heart rate and muscle strength during periods of physiologic stress. Liver cells treated with epinephrine showed marked increases in cAMP, as well as enhanced 26S proteasome activity and protein degradation. Epinephrine exposure also boosted proteasome activity -- a marker of protein degradation -- in the working hearts of rats. Similarly, when researchers exposed the kidney cells of mice to vasopressin -- the antidiuretic hormone that helps the body retain water and prevents dehydration -- they observed higher levels of protein degradation as well.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the rate of protein degradation can rise and fall swiftly in a variety of tissues in response to shifting conditions and that such changes are mediated by fluctuations in hormone levels. This response was also surprisingly rapid and short-lived, the scientists noted. For example, exposure to the antidiuretic hormone triggered protein breakdown in kidney cells within five minutes and subsided to pre-exposure levels within an hour, the experiments showed.</p>
<p>The findings show that a diverse set of hormones that stimulate the intracellular messenger cAMP appear to share a common mechanism that alters the composition of cells. cAMP-stimulating hormones have long been known to modify gene expression, but this latest research reveals they also play a critical role in cellular &quot;house cleaning&quot; by disposing of proteins that are no longer needed.</p>
<p>A new twist on a classic concept</p>
<p>Even the most mundane of activities -- eating, sleeping, exercise -- require the cells in our body to modulate their composition minute by minute in order to cope with new demands, all in the name of maintaining proper cellular function and averting harm. The new research reveals that some of these protective shifts occur in our cells' protein-disposal system, where misfolded or unneeded proteins are removed promptly and new ones in demand are synthesized swiftly.</p>
<p>The new findings build on observations about the physiologic effects of hormones first made by Harvard Medical School physician Walter Cannon nearly a century ago and elegantly captured in his book The Wisdom of the Body (1932). Some of Cannon's most notable work includes defining the mechanism of action of the hormone epinephrine and its role in the body's fight-or-flight response -- a key survival mechanism marked by a cascade of physiologic changes during times of high stress.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is one of the hormones whose action on the cells' protein-disposal machinery is now illuminated by Goldberg's latest work. In a twist of symbolic coincidence, Goldberg's lab occupies the very space where Cannon made his historic observations on the same hormone a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We think ours is truly a neoclassical discovery that builds on findings and observations made right here, in this very building, nearly a century ago,&quot; Goldberg said.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Most studies of proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway have focused on the regulation by ubiquitination. However, we showed that pharmacological agents that raise cAMP and activate protein kinase A by phosphorylating a proteasome subunit enhance proteasome activity and the cell’s capacity to selectively degrade misfolded and regulatory proteins. We investigated whether similar adaptations occur in physiological conditions where cAMP rises. Proteasome activity increases by this mechanism in human muscles following intense exercise, in mouse muscles and liver after a brief fast, in hepatocytes after epinephrine or glucagon, and renal collecting duct cells within 5 minutes of antidiuretic hormone. Thus, hormones and conditions that raise cAMP rapidly enhance proteasome activity and the cells’ capacity to eliminate damaged and preexistent regulatory proteins.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Pharmacological agents that raise cAMP and activate protein kinase A (PKA) stimulate 26S proteasome activity, phosphorylation of subunit Rpn6, and intracellular degradation of misfolded proteins. We investigated whether a similar proteasome activation occurs in response to hormones and under various physiological conditions that raise cAMP. Treatment of mouse hepatocytes with glucagon, epinephrine, or forskolin stimulated Rpn6 phosphorylation and the 26S proteasomes’ capacity to degrade ubiquitinated proteins and peptides. These agents promoted the selective degradation of short-lived proteins, which are misfolded and regulatory proteins, but not the bulk of cell proteins or lysosomal proteolysis. Proteasome activities and Rpn6 phosphorylation increased similarly in working hearts upon epinephrine treatment, in skeletal muscles of exercising humans, and in electrically stimulated rat muscles. In WT mouse kidney cells, but not in cells lacking PKA, treatment with antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) stimulated within 5-minutes proteasomal activity, Rpn6 phosphorylation, and the selective degradation of short-lived cell proteins. In livers and muscles of mice fasted for 12–48 hours cAMP levels, Rpn6 phosphorylation, and proteasomal activities increased without any change in proteasomal content. Thus, in vivo cAMP-PKA–mediated proteasome activation is a common cellular response to diverse endocrine stimuli and rapidly enhances the capacity of target tissues to degrade regulatory and misfolded proteins (e.g., proteins damaged upon exercise). The increased destruction of preexistent regulatory proteins may help cells adapt their protein composition to new physiological conditions.</p>

Living individuals (n = 29), four with detailed medical and dental records and three groups of archaeological individuals (n = 25) were radiographed; selected individuals were further evaluated histologically for the presence of incremental interglobular dentin (IIGD), indicative of deficiency (28 living; 17 archaeological). Measurements of pulp horns/chambers from radiographs were conducted to quantify morphological observations. One group had clear skeletal evidence of rickets from St. Matthew, Quebec (n = 1) and St. Jacques, France (n = 4); a second group had slight skeletal indicators from Bastion des Ursulines, Quebec (n = 6); and a third group lacked both skeletal and radiological evidence of deficiency from St. Antoine (n = 6) and Pointe-aux-Trembles (n = 4). Results showed archaeological individuals with clear and slight skeletal evidence of past deficiency displayed constricted or chair shaped pulp horns. Living individuals with deficiency exhibited similar pulp chamber morphology. Radiographic pulp horn/chamber measurements corroborated morphological findings and significant differences were found in pulp horn/chamber measurements between those with and without deficiency. Results suggest that radiograph assessment of teeth can be used as a screening technique to elucidate patterns of deficiency and select individuals for microCT or histological assessment.</li>

<p>As part of the study the researchers found that mice lacking a key protein required for responding to foreign RNA and therefore required for interferon beta production were better able to control the MTB infection. The discovery was a surprise to the researchers, as interferon beta is essential to controlling several viral infections.</p>
<p>&quot;The results suggest that our immune response to mycobacterial RNA is beneficial for the pathogen and bad for the host. It's the total opposite of viral infections,&quot; said Jeff Schorey, George B. Craig Jr. Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Notre Dame and co-author of the study. &quot;This study gives us a better understanding of how the mycobacteria causes disease and what makes it the most successful pathogen in human history.&quot;</p>
<p>MTB infections cause a battle between the immune response and the ability of the bacteria to circumvent that response -- who wins the battle determines the body's ability to control the infection. Schorey and Yong Cheng, a research assistant professor at Notre Dame, set out to determine how mycobacteria RNA could be affecting the host response. What they found was that by releasing RNA, the bacteria set off a chain reaction inside the macrophage, a cell type of the immune system -- resulting in a mechanism that benefits the survival of MTB through the production of interferon beta.</p>
<p>While researchers have long known that bacteria produce proteins and other compounds to modulate an immune response, such a role for mycobacterial nucleic acids has only recently been defined. In viral infections, as opposed to bacterial infections, the virus releases its nucleic acids as it needs the machinery of the host cell to help make viral proteins and replicate its genome. In contrast, bacteria already have the machinery for these processes in place, suggesting the release of RNA into the host cell is intentional. The authors found that the MTB use its secretion system known as SecA2 to mediate RNA release from the mycobacteria.</p>
<p>&quot;Bacteria have everything they need to make their proteins, so the fact that they were releasing nucleic acids was a surprise,&quot; Schorey said. &quot;These bugs are using this RNA-sensing pathway, which has evolved to promote antiviral activity -- so in other words, the bacteria are manipulating our own immune system against us.&quot;</p>
<p>MTB is the No. 1 cause of death by an infectious organism, and kills up to 1.8 million people each year. The World Health Organization estimates 200,000 of those deaths are children. Health officials lack an effective vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis, and antibiotics used to treat the disease must be taken for six to nine months -- a daunting regimen that challenges patient compliance. The disease is prevalent in parts of the world where health care systems lack infrastructure and funding.</p>
<p>Despite those challenges, Schorey, an affiliated faculty member at Notre Dame's Eck Institute for Global Health, said the study's results show potential for the development of immunotherapies to selectively stimulate protective immune responses as a treatment option for MTB and other bacterial infectious diseases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> RNA sensing pathways are key elements in a host immune response to viral pathogens, but little is known of their importance during bacterial infections. We found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) actively releases RNA into the macrophage cytosol using the mycobacterial SecA2 and ESX-1 secretion systems. The cytosolic M.tb RNA induces IFN-β production through the host RIG-I/MAVS/IRF7 RNA sensing pathway. The inducible expression of IRF7 within infected cells requires an autocrine signaling through IFN-β and its receptor, and this early IFN-β production is dependent on STING and IRF3 activation. M.tb infection studies using Mavs−/− mice support a role for RNA sensors in regulating IFN-β production and bacterial replication in vivo. Together, our data indicate that M.tb RNA is actively released during an infection and promotes IFN-β production through a regulatory mechanism involving cross-talk between DNA and RNA sensor pathways, and our data support the hypothesis that bacterial RNA can drive a host immune response.</p>

<li>Magnetic field (MF) non-ionizing radiation is widespread and everyone is exposed to some degree. This prospective cohort study of 913 pregnant women examined the association between high MF exposure and miscarriage risk. Cox (proportional hazards) regression was used to examine the association. After controlling for multiple other factors, women who were exposed to higher MF levels had 2.72 times the risk of miscarriage (hazard ratio = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.42–5.19) than those with lower MF exposure. The increased risk of miscarriage associated with high MF was consistently observed regardless of the sources of high MF. The association was much stronger if MF was measured on a typical day of participants’ pregnancies. The finding also demonstrated that accurate measurement of MF exposure is vital for examining MF health effects. This study provides fresh evidence, directly from a human population, that MF non-ionizing radiation could have adverse biological impacts on human health.</li>

Findings  In this retrospective analysis of a cohort study of 4251 participants, there was a statistically significant increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes in black vs white individuals. However, after adjustment for biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors during young adulthood, the disparity was no longer statistically significant (hazard ratio for women, 0.79; hazard ratio for men, 0.92).<br />
Meaning  Differences in traditional modifiable diabetes risk factors between black and white individuals may contribute to the racial disparity in diabetes incidence in middle age.</li>

<ul>
<li>In social groups, infections have the potential to spread rapidly and cause disease outbreaks. Here, we show that in a social insect, the ant <em>Lasius neglectus</em>, the negative consequences of fungal infections (<em>Metarhizium brunneum</em>) can be mitigated by employing an efficient multicomponent behaviour, termed destructive disinfection, which prevents further spread of the disease through the colony. Ants specifically target infected pupae during the pathogen’s non-contagious incubation period, utilising chemical ‘sickness cues’ emitted by pupae. They then remove the pupal cocoon, perforate its cuticle and administer antimicrobial poison, which enters the body and prevents pathogen replication from the inside out. Like the immune system of a metazoan body that specifically targets and eliminates infected cells, ants destroy infected brood to stop the pathogen completing its lifecycle, thus protecting the rest of the colony. Hence, in an analogous fashion, the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organisation.</li>

<ul>
<li>The molecular causes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well understood. Both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D are characterized by impaired insulin signaling and hyperglycemia. From analogy to T1D, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are thought to also play causal roles in T2D. Recent clinical studies, however, found that T2D patients treated to maintain glycemia below the diabetes definition threshold (HbA1c &lt; 6.5%) still develop diabetic complications. This suggests additional insulin- and glucose-independent mechanisms could be involved in T2D progression and/or initiation. T2D patients have elevated levels of the metabolite methylglyoxal (MG). We show here, using <em>Drosophila</em> glyoxalase 1 knockouts, that animals with elevated methylglyoxal recapitulate several core aspects of T2D: insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperglycemia. Thus elevated MG could constitute one root cause of T2D, suggesting that the molecular causes of elevated MG warrant further study.</li>

<ul>
<li>We tested the hypothesis that oral NaHCO3 intake stimulates splenic anti-inflammatory pathways. Following oral NaHCO3 loading, macrophage polarization was shifted from predominantly M1 (inflammatory) to M2 (regulatory) phenotypes, and FOXP3+CD4+ T-lymphocytes increased in the spleen, blood, and kidneys of rats. Similar anti-inflammatory changes in macrophage polarization were observed in the blood of human subjects following NaHCO3 ingestion. Surprisingly, we found that gentle manipulation to visualize the spleen at midline during surgical laparotomy (sham splenectomy) was sufficient to abolish the response in rats and resulted in hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the capsular mesothelial cells. Thin collagenous connections lined by mesothelial cells were found to connect to the capsular mesothelium. Mesothelial cells in these connections stained positive for the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 and acetylcholine esterase and contained many ultrastructural elements, which visually resembled neuronal structures. Both disruption of the fragile mesothelial connections or transection of the vagal nerves resulted in the loss of capsular mesothelial acetylcholine esterase staining and reduced splenic mass. Our data indicate that oral NaHCO3 activates a splenic anti-inflammatory pathway and provides evidence that the signals that mediate this response are transmitted to the spleen via a novel neuronal-like function of mesothelial cells.</li>

•Low pH suppresses oscillation of the molecular clock and circadian transcriptome<br />
•Acid scatters lysosomes, thereby silencing mTORC1 through separation from RHEB<br />
•mTORC1 inhibition by acid dampens clock network translation and collapses the clock</p>
<p>Recent reports indicate that hypoxia influences the circadian clock through the transcriptional activities of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at clock genes. Unexpectedly, we uncover a profound disruption of the circadian clock and diurnal transcriptome when hypoxic cells are permitted to acidify to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Buffering against acidification or inhibiting lactic acid production fully rescues circadian oscillation. Acidification of several human and murine cell lines, as well as primary murine T cells, suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, a key regulator of translation in response to metabolic status. We find that acid drives peripheral redistribution of normally perinuclear lysosomes away from perinuclear RHEB, thereby inhibiting the activity of lysosome-bound mTOR. Restoring mTORC1 signaling and the translation it governs rescues clock oscillation. Our findings thus reveal a model in which acid produced during the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia suppresses the circadian clock through diminished translation of clock constituents.</p>

<p><em>corroboration of a major role for herpes simplex virus type 1 in alzheimer’s disease</em><br />

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00324">http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00324</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong evidence has emerged recently for the concept that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) is a major risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This concept proposes that latent HSV1 in brain of carriers of the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE-ε4) is reactivated intermittently by events such as immunosuppression, peripheral infection, and inflammation, the consequent damage accumulating, and culminating eventually in the development of AD. Population data to investigate this epidemiologically, e.g., to find if subjects treated with antivirals might be protected from developing dementia—are available in Taiwan, from the National Health Insurance Research Database, in which 99.9% of the population has been enrolled. This is being extensively mined for information on microbial infections and disease. Three publications have now appeared describing data on the development of senile dementia (SD), and the treatment of those with marked overt signs of disease caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), or by HSV. The striking results show that the risk of SD is much greater in those who are HSV-seropositive than in seronegative subjects, and that antiviral treatment causes a dramatic decrease in number of subjects who later develop SD. It should be stressed that these results apply only to those with severe cases of HSV1 or VZV infection, but when considered with the over 150 publications that strongly support an HSV1 role in AD, they greatly justify usage of antiherpes antivirals to treat AD. Three other studies are described which directly relate to HSV1 and AD: they deal respectively with lysosomal changes in HSV1-infected cell cultures, with evidence for a role of human herpes virus type 6 and 7 (HHV6 and HHV7) in AD, and viral effects on host gene expression, and with the antiviral characteristics of beta amyloid (Aβ). Three indirectly relevant studies deal respectively with schizophrenia, relating to antiviral treatment to target HSV1, with the likelihood that HSV1 is a cause of fibromyalgia (FM), and with FM being associated with later development of SD. Studies on the link between epilepsy, AD and herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) are described also, as are the possible roles of APOE-ε4, HHV6 and HSV1 in epilepsy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“It is worth stressing though that these data and the preceding evidence for a role of HSV1 in AD, do not preclude a role for bacteria, in particular, <em>Borrelia, Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>, and some oral bacteria, which are probably the microbes most strongly implicated in AD (see review, Miklossy and McGeer, 2016): one or more such microbes might be involved, leading to the disease in the sizeable proportion of AD patients whose illness is <em>not</em> accounted for by HSV1 (in combination with APOE-ε4).”</p>

<p>“As to the effects of treating AD patients long term, ACV causes few side-effects except in renally impaired patients; these should therefore be excluded from relevant trials”</p>

Prior to this, scientists did not have images covering every period of an Alzheimer patient's life. Researchers suggested modelling the changes generally seen in the volumes of different structures using a vast quantity of samples in order to pinpoint where healthy brains diverged from diseased ones over time.</p>
<p>Based on MRI scans from 2,944 healthy control subjects between the ages of 9 months to 94 years old, the team developed a 'normal' model of average brain changes, which they compared to a pathological model based on MRIs from 1,385 Alzheimer's patients aged over 55 and 1,877 young control subjects. Their results show an early divergence between the pathological models and the normal trajectory of ageing of the hippocampus before age 40, and of the amygdala around age 40. Both of these structures suffer atrophy in the presence of Alzheimer's disease. Also evident is an early enlargement, in patients with the disease, of an internal cavity in the brain known as the lateral ventricle. This enlargement is part of the ageing process in normal subjects too, however, thus limiting the pertinence of this measurement in subjects of an advanced age, and reaffirming the usefulness of studying biomarkers across an entire life span</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Brain imaging studies have shown that slow and progressive cerebral atrophy characterized the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Despite a large number of studies dedicated to AD, key questions about the lifespan evolution of AD biomarkers remain open. When does the AD model diverge from the normal aging model? What is the lifespan trajectory of imaging biomarkers for AD? How do the trajectories of biomarkers in AD differ from normal aging? To answer these questions, we proposed an innovative way by inferring brain structure model across the entire lifespan using a massive number of MRI (N = 4329). We compared the normal model based on 2944 control subjects with the pathological model based on 3262 patients (AD + Mild cognitive Impaired subjects) older than 55 years and controls younger than 55 years. Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD models from the normal aging trajectory before 40 years for the hippocampus, followed by the lateral ventricles and the amygdala around 40 years. Moreover, our lifespan model reveals the evolution of these biomarkers and suggests close abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala, whereas trajectory of ventricular enlargement appears to follow an inverted U-shape. Finally, our models indicate that medial temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular enlargement are two mid-life physiopathological events characterizing AD brain.</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail atmospherics is becoming an increasingly important strategic tool for stores and restaurants. Ambient music and background noise are especially important atmospheric elements given their ubiquity in retail settings. However, there is high variation in the volume of ambient music and background noise, with some stores/restaurants having very loud ambience and others having very quiet ambience. Given the variation in loudness levels at stores/restaurants, and the managerial ease of adjusting volume level, we investigate the consequences of ambient music (and background noise) volume on food choices and sales. A pilot study, two field experiments, and five lab studies show that low (vs. high or no) volume music/noise leads to increased sales of healthy foods due to induced relaxation. In contrast, high volume music/noise tends to enhance excitement levels, which in turn leads to unhealthy food choices.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cells in tissues undergo transdifferentiation programs when stimulated by specific mechanical and biochemical signals. While seminal studies have demonstrated that exogenous biochemical factors can reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, the critical roles played by mechanical signals in such reprogramming process have not been well documented. In this paper, we show that laterally confined growth of fibroblasts on micropatterned substrates induces nuclear reprogramming with high efficiency in the absence of any exogenous reprogramming factors. We provide compelling evidence on the induction of stem cell-like properties using alkaline phosphatase assays and expression of pluripotent markers. Early onset of reprogramming was accompanied with enhanced nuclear dynamics and changes in chromosome intermingling degrees, potentially facilitating rewiring of the genome. Time-lapse analysis of promoter occupancy by immunoprecipitation of H3K9Ac chromatin fragments revealed that epithelial, proliferative, and reprogramming gene promoters were progressively acetylated, while mesenchymal promoters were deacetylated by 10 days. Consistently, RNA sequencing analysis showed a systematic progression from mesenchymal to stem cell transcriptome, highlighting pathways involving mechanisms underlying nuclear reprogramming. We then demonstrated that these mechanically reprogrammed cells could be maintained as stem cells and can be redifferentiated into multiple lineages with high efficiency. Importantly, we also demonstrate the induction of cancer stemness properties in MCF7 cells grown in such laterally confined conditions. Collectively, our results highlight an important generic property of somatic cells that, when grown in laterally confined conditions, acquire stemness. Such mechanical reprogramming of somatic cells demonstrated here has important implications in tissue regeneration and disease models.</li>

<ul>
<li>Uncovering the interaction between genomes and the environment is a principal challenge of modern genomics and preventive medicine. While theoretical models are well defined, little is known of the G × E interactions in humans. We used an integrative approach to comprehensively assess the interactions between 1.6 million data points, encompassing a range of environmental exposures, health, and gene expression levels, coupled with whole-genome genetic variation. From ∼1000 individuals of a founder population in Quebec, we reveal a substantial impact of the environment on the transcriptome and clinical endophenotypes, overpowering that of genetic ancestry. Air pollution impacts gene expression and pathways affecting cardio-metabolic and respiratory traits, when controlling for genetic ancestry. Finally, we capture four expression quantitative trait loci that interact with the environment (air pollution). Our findings demonstrate how the local environment directly affects disease risk phenotypes and that genetic variation, including less common variants, can modulate individual’s response to environmental challenges.</li>

<ul>
<li>In Brazil, chronic diseases account for the largest percentage of all deaths among men and women. Among the cardiovascular diseases, stroke is the leading cause of death, accounting for 10% of all deaths. We evaluated associations between stroke and mean air temperature using recorded mortality data and meteorological station data from 2002 to 2011. A time series analysis was applied to 55,633 mortality cases. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes (IS and HS, respectively) were divided to test different impact on which subgroup. Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was used and adjusted for seasonality, pollutants, humidity, and days of the week. HS mortality was associated with low mean temperatures for men relative risk (RR) = 2.43 (95% CI, 1.12–5.28) and women RR = 1.39 (95% CI, 1.03–1.86). RR of IS mortality was not significant using a 21-day lag window. Analyzing the lag response separately, we observed that the effect of temperature is acute in stroke mortality (higher risk among lags 0–5). However, for IS, higher mean temperatures were significant for this subtype with more than 15-day lag. Our findings showed that mean air temperature is associated with stroke mortality in the city of São Paulo for men and women and IS and HS may have different triggers. Further studies are needed to evaluate physiologic differences between these two subtypes of stroke.</li>

<ul>
<li>Genetic factors predictive of severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are largely unknown. To identify genetic variation associated with severe AIS, we performed an exome-wide association study of 457 severe AIS cases and 987 controls. We find a missense SNP in SLC39A8 (p.Ala391Thr, rs13107325) associated with severe AIS (P = 1.60 × 10−7, OR = 2.01, CI = 1.54–2.62). This pleiotropic SNP was previously associated with BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood manganese level. We replicate the association in a second cohort (841 cases and 1095 controls) resulting in a combined P = 7.02 × 10−14, OR = 1.94, CI = 1.63–2.34. Clinically, the minor allele of rs13107325 is associated with greater spinal curvature, decreased height, increased BMI and lower plasma manganese in our AIS cohort. Functional studies demonstrate reduced manganese influx mediated by the SLC39A8 p.Ala391Thr variant and vertebral abnormalities, impaired growth, and decreased motor activity in slc39a8 mutant zebrafish. Our results suggest the possibility that scoliosis may be amenable to dietary intervention.</li>

<ul>
<li>Biofilm formation on stainless steel (SS) surfaces of food-processing plants, leading to food-borne illness outbreaks, is enabled by the attachment and confinement of pathogens within microscale cavities of surface roughness (grooves, scratches). We report foodsafe oil-based slippery coatings (FOSCs) for food-processing surfaces that suppress bacterial adherence and biofilm formation by trapping residual oil lubricant within these surface cavities to block microbial growth. SS surfaces were chemically functionalized with alkylphosphonic acid to preferentially wet a layer of food-grade oil. FOSCs reduced the effective surface roughness, the adhesion of organic food residue, and bacteria. FOSCs significantly reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation on standard roughness SS-316 by 5 log CFU cm–2, and by 3 log CFU cm–2 for mirror-finished SS. FOSCs also enhanced surface cleanability, which we measured by bacterial counts after conventional detergent cleaning. Importantly, both SS grades maintained their antibiofilm activity after the erosion of the oil layer by surface wear with glass beads, which suggests that there is a residual volume of oil that remains to block surface cavity defects. These results indicate the potential of such low-cost, scalable approaches to enhance the cleanability of SS food-processing surfaces and improve food safety by reducing biofilm growth.</li>

<li>l interventions against aging should be efficacious when started in adults and, ideally, repurpose existing drugs. We show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved by targeting mul- tiple, evolutionarily conserved aging pathways and mechanisms using drug combinations. Using this approach in C. elegans, we were able to slow aging and significantly extend healthy lifespan. To identify the mechanism of these drug synergies, we applied transcriptomics and lipidomics analysis. We found that drug interactions involved the TGF-b pathway and recruited genes related with IGF signaling. daf-2, daf-7, and sbp-1 interact upstream of changes in lipid metabolism, resulting in increased monoun- saturated fatty acid content and this is required for healthy lifespan extension. These data suggest that combinations of drugs targeting distinct subsets of the aging gene regulatory network can be leveraged to cause synergistic lifespan benefits.</li>

<li>babies normally have a higher temperature than adults, and men often have a higher temperature than women. for example, my baby’s temperature is normally x, while mine is y. it is basic–level science to say “my baby’s temperature is normally x, and if it is not x, something is wrong”. however, that is not sufficient. when my baby cries, normally his temperature is higher than normal — even when not sick. so if I measure my baby’s temperature  when he is crying, and it is x, that is not the temperature I should expect — something may be wrong.</li>

<p>can't promise that you'll never have a sore throat ever again, but I can promise that this will reduce the severity of the symptoms. Sore throats commonly occur when we are ill, and the symptom is a pain in the throat area. The pain comes because the upper airway, just below the epiglottis, has become drier, and the lining of the airway thus becomes more sensitive. Causes of the dryness could include illness slowing mucus production deeper in the lungs, or very dry air in the house or outside. The temporary solution, however, is easy — you can often relieve a painful sore throat in minutes — all you need to do is to swallow. Swallowing, without actually needing to swallow any food or water, is sufficient to encourage local mucus movement and production right where it is needed most. You may want to experiment with swallowing at different intervals or in different patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swallowing eases the symptom of a sore throat by encouraging wetter mucous from lungs to move faster towards the normal exit point of the oesophagus. Thus the dried out area of the trachea or throat which is hurting is covered by mucous and soothed temporarily.<br />
Seems like common sense once you know it but seems slightly esoteric before you understand why it works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a longer–term solution, drink water often enough to replenish your internal supplies so you can produce enough mucus to suit the air or illness. The only downside is that you'll no longer be able to complain about having a sore throat when you are ill, so people won't believe your illness is as bad as theirs!</p>

<p><em>investigating the case of human nose shape and climate adaptation</em><br />

<p>The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use Qst–Fst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection.</p>
<p>Author summary<br />
The study of human adaptation is essential to our understanding of disease etiology. Evolutionary investigations into why certain disease phenotypes such as sickle-cell anemia and lactose intolerance occur at different rates in different populations have led to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors involved. Similarly, research into the geographical distribution of skin pigmentation continues to yield important clues regarding risk of vitamin D deficiency and skin cancer. Here, we investigate whether variation in the shape of the external nose across populations has been driven by regional differences in climate. We find that variation in both nares width and alar base width appear to have experienced accelerated divergence across human populations. We also find that the geospatial distribution of nares width is correlated with temperature, and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. Our results support the claim that local adaptation to climate may have had a role in the evolution of nose shape differences across human populations.</p>

<li>In vivo and in vitro LPS exposure induced a 2-fold increase in NMDE secretion along with a 2-fold increase in exosomal inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and function through TLR4 and inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase activation. LPS stimulation increased exosomal microbiocidal activity against P aeruginosa by almost 2 orders of magnitude. LPS-stimulated exosomes induced a 4-fold increase in NO production within autologous epithelial cells with protein transfer within 5 minutes of contact. Pathway analysis of the NMDE proteome revealed 44 additional proteins associated with NO signaling and innate immune function</li>

<li>“Intrigued by what I learned in Lipton’s book but curious to know more, I interviewed him. He explained to me that in his bench research as a cell biologist, he worked with pleuripotential stem cells, cells that can become anything when they grow up. He placed one cell in a Petri dish, where it was nourished with cell-culture medium, as it divided into many genetically identical cells. Lipton then split the cells into three Petri dishes and exposed them to three different culture mediums (the environment). What he discovered was that the environment to which the cell was exposed determined whether the cell became a muscle cell or a fat cell or a bone cell. Even though all the cells were genetically identical, they expressed themselves differently. The final outcome of the same genetically identical DNA was expressed as radically different cells. What controlled the fate of the cells? Not the genetics. They were all genetically identical. The sole difference was the environment to which the same DNA was exposed. The cellular environment also determined whether or not the cells stayed healthy. Cells exposed to a “good” environment (a healthy cell medium) enjoyed optimal health, while those exposed to a “bad” environment (an unhealthy cell medium) got sick. Lipton said, “If I were an allopathic physician of cells, I’d diagnose the cells in the bad medium as sick. Surely, they need medicine. But that’s not really what they need. If you take the sick cells out of the bad environment and put them back into the good environment, they naturally recover—without medicine.” One day, as he was observing the cells in his lab, Lipton had an epiphany. He realized that the human body is no different from the cells in his lab. Lipton said, “The human is nothing more than a skin-covered Petri dish with a community of 50 trillion cells. Whether the cells are in our bodies or in the Petri dish doesn’t matter. The culture medium of the cells in our bodies is the blood that bathes and feeds them. If we change the composition of the blood, it’s the same as changing the culture medium of the cells. So what controls the composition of the blood? The brain is the chemist changing the environment to which our cells are exposed. The brain releases neuropeptides, hormones, growth factors, and other chemicals, akin to adding chemicals to a Petri dish with a pipette, thereby changing the cell medium.” When I asked him how belief can change the cellular environment, Lipton explained that the brain is perception, but the mind is interpretation. It’s all about how the mind interprets a life event. For example, you can open your eyes and see a person. (This is your brain’s objective perception.) Your mind may then recognize this person as someone you love. (This is the mind’s interpretation.) The brain then releases oxytocin, dopamine, endorphins, and other positive chemicals that provide the healthy cell medium of the whole body’s cells via the blood. If, on the other hand, you open your eyes and see a person (the perception), and your mind interprets this person as scary, the brain releases stress hormones and other fear chemicals that damage the cells. Lipton says, “When we shift the mind’s interpretation of illness from fear and danger to positive belief, the brain responds biochemically, the blood changes the body’s cell culture, and the cells change on a biological level.”</li>
