<p><em>phenological synchronization disrupts trophic interactions between kodiak brown bears and salmon</em><br />
william w. deacy et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1705248114">dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1705248114</a></p>

<p>Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of biological events, effectively rescheduling the potential interactions among species. We know specialist consumers suffer when they fail to synchronize with their prey; however, little is known about how generalist consumers respond to phenological shifts across multiple food resources. This reshuffling may create novel temporal overlap between foods that were once separated in time. We examined how a generalist consumer, the Kodiak brown bear, responded when two key foods, red elderberry and sockeye salmon, became synchronized. Bears switched from eating salmon to elderberries, disrupting an ecological link that typically fertilizes terrestrial ecosystems and generates high mortality rates for salmon. These results demonstrate an underappreciated mechanism by which climate-altered phenologies can alter food webs.</p>
<p>Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of life cycle events in organisms across the planet, but the magnitude of change often varies among taxa [Thackeray SJ, et al. (2016) <em>Nature</em> 535:241–245]. This can cause the temporal relationships among species to change, altering the strength of interaction. A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos middendorffi</em>), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em>) and red elderberry (<em>Sambucus racemosa</em>). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25–75% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016) <em>Oecologia</em> 183:415–429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator–prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006) <em>Ecosystems</em> 9:167–180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.</p>

<p><em>volcanic suppression of nile summer flooding triggers revolt and constrains interstate conflict in ancient egypt</em><br />
joseph g. manning et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>Volcanic eruptions provide tests of human and natural system sensitivity to abrupt shocks because their repeated occurrence allows the identification of systematic relationships in the presence of random variability. Here we show a suppression of Nile summer flooding via the radiative and dynamical impacts of explosive volcanism on the African monsoon, using climate model output, ice-core-based volcanic forcing data, Nilometer measurements, and ancient Egyptian writings. We then examine the response of Ptolemaic Egypt (305–30 BCE), one of the best-documented ancient superpowers, to volcanically induced Nile suppression. Eruptions are associated with revolt onset against elite rule, and the cessation of Ptolemaic state warfare with their great rival, the Seleukid Empire. Eruptions are also followed by socioeconomic stress with increased hereditary land sales, and the issuance of priestly decrees to reinforce elite authority. Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agricultural regions, presently including 70% of world population.</li>

<p><em>dust outpaces bedrock in nutrient supply to montane forest ecosystems</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Dust provides ecosystem-sustaining nutrients to landscapes underlain by intensively weathered soils. Here we show that dust may also be crucial in montane forest ecosystems, dominating nutrient budgets despite continuous replacement of depleted soils with fresh bedrock via erosion. Strontium and neodymium isotopes in modern dust show that Asian sources contribute 18–45% of dust deposition across our Sierra Nevada, California study sites. The remaining dust originates regionally from the nearby Central Valley. Measured dust fluxes are greater than or equal to modern erosional outputs from hillslopes to channels, and account for 10–20% of estimated millennial-average inputs of bedrock P. Our results demonstrate that exogenic dust can drive the evolution of nutrient budgets in montane ecosystems, with implications for predicting forest response to changes in climate and land use.</li>

<p><em>bioaerosol generation by raindrops on soil</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile and climate conditions.</li>
<li>In conclusion, this work has importance in three aspects; first, we have observed a new mechanism of bioaerosol generation caused by rain. Once bacteria are dispersed through aerosols, they can be transported by wind to other places much faster than other modes of transfer such as diffusion through soil. Second, we have identified experimental methods to collect and visualize aerosols including bacteria dispersed from soil. Using this method, we defined a new surface property denoted aerosolization efficiency, which describes how many bacteria can be transferred under given conditions. Third, we found that the mechanism of bacteria transfer by raindrops with bubble formation affected by surface temperature and impact speed. With understanding this mechanism, one can begin to develop methods of preventing or promoting bacterial transfer. As a result, we can predict the locations and environmental conditions that promote the transfer of bacteria from soil to air. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of bacteria transfer from soil to the environment. This mechanism can be relevant for the investigation of climate change, pathogenic disease transmission and geographic migration of bacteria.p</li>

<p><em>temporal variation in pelagic food chain length in response to environmental change</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Climate variability alters nitrogen cycling, primary productivity, and dissolved oxygen concentration in marine ecosystems. We examined the role of this variability (as measured by six variables) on food chain length (FCL) in the California Current (CC) by reconstructing a time series of amino acid–specific δ15N values derived from common dolphins, an apex pelagic predator, and using two FCL proxies. Strong declines in FCL were observed after the 1997–1999 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Bayesian models revealed longer FCLs under intermediate conditions for surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, multivariate ENSO index, and total plankton volume but not for hypoxic depth and nitrate concentration. Our results challenge the prevalent paradigm that suggested long-term stability in the food web structure in the CC and, instead, reveal that pelagic food webs respond strongly to disturbances associated with ENSO events, local oceanography, and ongoing changes in climate.</li>

<li>Predicting how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect the hydrologic cycle is of utmost importance for a range of applications ranging from ecological services to human life and activities. A typical perspective is that hydrologic change is driven by precipitation and radiation changes due to climate change, and that the land surface will adjust. Using Earth system models with decoupled surface (vegetation physiology) and atmospheric (radiative) CO2 responses, we here show that the CO2 physiological response has a dominant role in evapotranspiration and evaporative fraction changes and has a major effect on long-term runoff compared with radiative or precipitation changes due to increased atmospheric CO2. This major effect is true for most hydrological stress variables over the largest fraction of the globe, except for soil moisture, which exhibits a more nonlinear response. This highlights the key role of vegetation in controlling future terrestrial hydrologic response and emphasizes that the carbon and water cycles are intimately coupled over land.</li>

<p><em>skillful empirical subseasonal prediction of landfalling atmospheric river activity using the madden–julian oscillation and quasi-biennial oscillation</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Upon landfall, atmospheric rivers (ARs)—plumes of intense water vapor transport—often trigger weather and hydrologic extremes. Presently, no guidance is available to alert decision makers to anomalous AR activity within the subseasonal time scale (~2–5 weeks). Here, we construct and evaluate an empirical prediction scheme for anomalous AR activity based solely on the initial state of two prominent modes of tropical variability: the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The MJO—the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropical troposphere—modulates landfalling AR activity along the west coast of North America by exciting large-scale circulation anomalies over the North Pacific. In light of emerging science regarding the modulation of the MJO by the QBO—the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical stratosphere—we demonstrate that the MJO–AR relationship is further influenced by the QBO. Evaluating the prediction scheme over 36 boreal winter seasons, we find skillful subseasonal “forecasts of opportunity” when knowledge of the MJO and the QBO can be leveraged to predict periods of increased or decreased AR activity. Certain MJO and QBO phase combinations provide empirical subseasonal predictive skill for anomalous AR activity that exceeds that of a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. Given the wide-ranging impacts associated with landfalling ARs, even modest gains in the subseasonal prediction of anomalous AR activity may support decision making and benefit numerous sectors of society.</li>

<li>Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow and elongated bands of anomalous water vapour transport that have been widely studied due to their notable influence on regional weather patterns, surface hydrology, and the global water cycle. Although ARs produce a relatively large proportion of the annual precipitation in the southeastern quadrant of the United States, a detailed climatological analysis of Southeastern atmospheric rivers (SE-ARs) has not been conducted. In this study, a climatology of SE-AR coastal interactions from 1979 to 2014 was constructed from a global AR data set to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of SE-ARs as well as the importance of synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability in modulating their frequency. The climatology revealed that SE-ARs were most prevalent during the cold season, with the majority of these wintertime coastal interactions occurring predominately in the Gulf of Mexico. The synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability favourable for SE-AR development differed depending on the season and sub-region of the Southeast considered. More specifically, a dipole effect was discovered, as conditions conducive for SE-AR coastal interactions along the western Gulf generally inhibited SE-AR interactions with the Florida Peninsula and vice versa. Overall, a better understanding of the seasonality of SE-ARs as well as the synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability that encourage their development could lead to improved forecasting and community awareness of the devastating AR-related flood events that occur throughout the Southeast.</li>

<p><em>coherent modulation of the sea-level annual cycle in the united states by atlantic rossby waves</em><br />
francisco m. calafat et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04898-y">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04898-y</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the sea-level annual cycle (SLAC) can have profound impacts on coastal areas, including increased flooding risk and ecosystem alteration, yet little is known about the magnitude and drivers of such changes. Here we show, using novel Bayesian methods, that there are significant decadal fluctuations in the amplitude of the SLAC along the United States Gulf and Southeast coasts, including an extreme event in 2008–2009 that is likely (probability ≥68%) unprecedented in the tide-gauge record. Such fluctuations are coherent along the coast but decoupled from deep-ocean changes. Through the use of numerical and analytical ocean models, we show that the primary driver of these fluctuations involves incident Rossby waves that generate fast western-boundary waves. These Rossby waves project onto the basin-wide upper mid-ocean transport (top 1000 m) leading to a link with the SLAC, wherein larger SLAC amplitudes coincide with enhanced transport variability.</li>

<p><em>the detection of rossby-like waves on the sun</em><br />

<li>Rossby waves are a type of global-scale wave that develops in planetary atmospheres, driven by the planet’s rotation<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref1">13</a>. They propagate westward owing to the Coriolis force, and their characterization enables more precise forecasting of weather on Earth<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref2">14</a>,<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref3">15</a>. Despite the massive reservoir of rotational energy available in the Sun’s interior and decades of observational investigation, their solar analogue defies unambiguous identification<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref4">16</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref5">17</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref6">18</a>. Here we analyse a combined set of images obtained by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft between 2011 and 2013 in order to follow the evolution of small bright features, called brightpoints, which are tracers of rotationally driven large-scale convection<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref7">19</a>. We report the detection of persistent, global-scale bands of magnetized activity on the Sun that slowly meander westward in longitude and display Rossby-wave-like behaviour. These magnetized Rossby waves allow us to make direct connections between decadal-scale solar activity and that on much shorter timescales. Monitoring the properties of these waves, and the wavenumber of the disturbances that they generate, has the potential to yield a considerable improvement in forecast capability for solar activity and related space weather phenomena.</li>

<ul>
<li>entropy
<ul>
<li>I dispute that entropy is fundamental to the universe. I just don't like it, just as I don't like schrödinger's cat.</li>
<li>the worship of order over seeming disorder is mistaken. odum knew as much when he criticised people for assuming nature to be simple rather than a complex ordered system. in almost the reverse of this, I believe we may be mistaken that complexity is a desired outcome, even though odum admits simplicity has its place. I believe they are our categories which are not really relevant to reality outside of our conception of it.</li>
<li>it could be that humans are supposed to have this explosive growth (if you believe in probability) so that at least a few of us are well adapted in the darwinian sense to the environment of the earth after humankind crashes to sustainable levels again.</li>
<li>it is an error to believe that all explosive growth is bad, perhaps sometimes it is necessary in order to overcome some obstacle that could best be overcome in this way.</li>
<li>odum assumes overpopulation is necessary for selection, as is the death of some of that overpopulation. I think it suffices that some do not reproduce, but the assumption that it is the best that reproduce is erroneous and self–serving.</li>
<li>it is an illusion of human desire for control and order that the desired theory to represent reality should be based on those principles.</li>
<li>most people believe that they need these principles to be true for them (the people) to survive. this is untrue. they are addicted to those principles and this type of addiction leads them to believe in this way. this could be the main reason why it can be difficult for people to get to grips with what we say — if this challenges this addictive belief, but they cannot overcome their addiction, they will not be able to change their belief. so again it comes down to what kind of person can already overcome their addiction and what people can do to learn how to do this. against this are arrayed abusive people who find it suits their way of life for most people to be addicted to their situation.</li>
<li>and to go on to why those people are abusive is the topic of the next section. i.e.:</li>
<li>people act abusively when they are in the habit of doing so. which means all sorts of things like how important our choices are because how we choose makes a great difference to whether and how we maintain habits. this is why so–called &quot;freedom&quot; is important. and closeness to current reality is not a common feature of habit.</li>
<li>so the process of becoming responsible is often at first similar to stopping an addictive habit like smoking.</li>

<li>momentum
<ul>
<li>timing of effort
<ul>
<li>on the timing of effort as a major theme of the book, the “new way of thinking” that it introduces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>downward to forward
<ul>
<li>when serving overhead or for smashing forwards, doing the reversed sequence for high jumping i.e. jump high then land with leg angled behind to convert downward motion to forward motion will increase power of forward ball motion in addition to swing. this technique will work for all similar actions such as martial arts punches kicks etc.</li>
<li>“reverse jump” used to change downward momentum for karate chop</li>
<li>walking and running are really falling forwards in a controlled manner. if we want to run faster, allow this falling to occur more rapidly by taking lots of small steps quickly rather than trying to push with legs. this is how we can run long distances with low energy expenditure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>forward to up
<ul>
<li>upward momentum from converting forward momentum of body at running speed to body moving upwards with low forward speed</li>
<li>forward to up for high kick</li>
<li>same applies for walking and running uphill — convert some of the forward momentum from falling forwards into upward momentum so you are not pushing all the way uphill</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>jump angle for rejump
<ul>
<li>if landing, say between 45° and 90° of horizontal, is momentum once again transferred upwards? this would help rejump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vertical descent
<ul>
<li>if coming down vertical surface, can use same principle to slow descent using that surface? i.e. does lower foot transfer momentum in, towards surface, so can use upper to slow using friction on surface? and if well trained, can we keep doing this some way down the surface?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>increasing apparent weight
<ul>
<li>bagua
<ul>
<li>in a similar manner to vertical descent converting momentum in one plane to momentum in perpendicular plane, the same effect occurs in martial arts where in <em>bagua</em> for example, motion in a horizontal plane augments downward force when it is converted by the action of the lower body — this is used to seemingly make the body <em>weigh</em> more and be more rooted to the ground. the intention is the same, all that is different is the way of describing it in words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bus surfing
<ul>
<li>again in a similar manner, bus surfing converts for example forward momentum when person standing in a decelerating bus is converted by an angled front foot into downward momentum applied through mostly the rear foot, increasing friction and thus steadiness of the standing rider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>wavelike
<ul>
<li>diving through the crest of a wave in surf is like a kick–turn in swimming — when you know a good place and means to insert effort or change tack it can be super–effective. sometimes the situation is manmade, like a swimming pool, but more often it is natural like a wave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rolling momentum
<ul>
<li>on a bicycle, start pedaling faster on approach to hill — gradually faster until at maximum speed at base of hill. keep pedaling on the upward slope while gradually changing gear. this is the quickest and most effective way to pedal up a hill</li>
<li>keep forward motion steady by using an even cadence on pedals, as trying to speed up after deceleration is harder than keeping up a steady speed</li>
<li>small regular fast steps are particularly good for keeping momentum moving as it is like pushing stroke during fastest phase of swimming — least effort is expended for maximum effect, and rather than requiring energy to be diverted to repeated re–acceleration, it can be used sparingly to continue forward motion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>swinging momentum
<ul>
<li>momentum when swinging from handhold to handhold — body to keep moving forward</li>
</ul>
