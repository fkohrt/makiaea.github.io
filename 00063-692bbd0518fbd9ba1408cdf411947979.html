<p>energy leaves its environmental footprint home.</p>
<p>In this month's journal Applied Energy, MSU researchers examine China's flow of virtual energy -- the energy used to produce goods and products in one place that are shipped away. What they found was that virtual energy flowed from less-populated, energy-scarce areas in China's western regions to booming cities in the energy-abundant east.</p>
<p>In fact, the virtual energy transferred west to east was much greater than the physical energy that moves through China's massive infrastructure investment, the West-To-East Electricity Transmission Project. China is a powerful model of energy use, having surpassed the United States. In 2013, nearly 22 percent of global energy use occurred in China.</p>
<p>Conserving energy and managing its accompanying environmental impacts are a growing concern across the world, and it is crucial to take a holistic look at all the ways energy is used and moved,&quot; said Jianguo &quot;Jack&quot; Liu, Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability of MSU's Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability (CSIS). &quot;Only when we understand the full picture of who is producing energy and who is consuming it in all its forms can we make effective policy decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>Virtual energy is considered critical to avoiding regional energy crises since commodities traded from one location to another include virtual energy. This means the importing area can avoid expending the energy to produce the imported commodities. The paper &quot;Shift in a National Virtual Energy Network&quot; examines how a region's energy haves and have-nots meet economic and energy needs by acknowledging energy is tightly wound around economic growth and demand.</p>
<p>The researchers are first to focus on energy use after the 2008 global financial crisis, seeing how economic desperation can have a big, not always obvious, impact on energy -- and the pollution and environmental degradation that can accompany its use.</p>
<p>&quot;China, like a lot of places across the globe, has an uneven distribution of energy resources, and China also is developing quickly,&quot; said the article's first author Zhenci Xu, an MSU-CSIS PhD student. &quot;We wanted to understand the true paths of energy use when economic growth kicks into gear after a financial crisis. Eventually, all the costs of energy use, including environmental damage and pollution, have to be accounted for, and current policies focus primarily on physical energy, not virtual energy.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers found a persistent flow of total virtual energy from energy-scare to energy-abundant provinces increased from 43.2% in 2007 to 47.5% in 2012. Following the framework of metacoupling (socioeconomic-environmental interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant places), they also discovered after the financial crisis, trade was taking place between distant provinces -- trade that came with energy's environmental footprint.</p>
<p>The authors note these types of analyses are needed across the globe to guide policies that hold the areas that are shifting their energy consumption to appropriately contribute to mitigating the true costs of energy.</p>

<p>•Virtual energy transferred from energy-scarce to energy-abundant provinces in China increased.<br />
•Changes in flow pattern of China’s virtual energy network since the financial crisis were revealed.<br />
•Most provinces had more distant virtual energy trade than nearby virtual energy trade.<br />
•Virtual energy flowing from west China to east China was greater than physical energy through the WTEETP.</p>
<p>Energy is one of the most fundamental resources for humans and nature. Virtual energy transfer is considered one potential mechanism to alleviate energy shortages and support socioeconomic development in energy-scarce regions. However, little research has explored the change in flow pattern of national virtual energy trade since the 2008 global financial crisis. To fill this knowledge gap, we choose China’s interprovincial virtual energy transfer network as a demonstration, since China is the world's biggest energy consumer and features a starkly uneven spatial distribution of energy resources. Surprisingly, the total virtual energy transferred from energy-scarce to energy-abundant provinces increased from 43.2% to 47.5% from 2007 to 2012. In particular, the virtual oil which transferred from energy-scarce to energy-abundant provinces grew from 51.5% in 2007 to 54.0% in 2012. The percentage of provinces that transferred a greater amount of total virtual energy than was consumed internally increased from 23.3% in 2007 to 36.7% in 2012. Unexpectedly, the total virtual energy flowing from west China to east China was much greater than physical energy transferred through the West-To-East Electricity Transmission Project (WTEETP). This study suggests that it would be interesting to study patterns of interactions of virtual energy networks in other countries.</p>

<p><em>phenological synchronization disrupts trophic interactions between kodiak brown bears and salmon</em><br />

<p>Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of biological events, effectively rescheduling the potential interactions among species. We know specialist consumers suffer when they fail to synchronize with their prey; however, little is known about how generalist consumers respond to phenological shifts across multiple food resources. This reshuffling may create novel temporal overlap between foods that were once separated in time. We examined how a generalist consumer, the Kodiak brown bear, responded when two key foods, red elderberry and sockeye salmon, became synchronized. Bears switched from eating salmon to elderberries, disrupting an ecological link that typically fertilizes terrestrial ecosystems and generates high mortality rates for salmon. These results demonstrate an underappreciated mechanism by which climate-altered phenologies can alter food webs.</p>
<p>Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of life cycle events in organisms across the planet, but the magnitude of change often varies among taxa [Thackeray SJ, et al. (2016) <em>Nature</em> 535:241–245]. This can cause the temporal relationships among species to change, altering the strength of interaction. A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos middendorffi</em>), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em>) and red elderberry (<em>Sambucus racemosa</em>). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25–75% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016) <em>Oecologia</em> 183:415–429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator–prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006) <em>Ecosystems</em> 9:167–180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.</p>

<p><em>volcanic suppression of nile summer flooding triggers revolt and constrains interstate conflict in ancient egypt</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Volcanic eruptions provide tests of human and natural system sensitivity to abrupt shocks because their repeated occurrence allows the identification of systematic relationships in the presence of random variability. Here we show a suppression of Nile summer flooding via the radiative and dynamical impacts of explosive volcanism on the African monsoon, using climate model output, ice-core-based volcanic forcing data, Nilometer measurements, and ancient Egyptian writings. We then examine the response of Ptolemaic Egypt (305–30 BCE), one of the best-documented ancient superpowers, to volcanically induced Nile suppression. Eruptions are associated with revolt onset against elite rule, and the cessation of Ptolemaic state warfare with their great rival, the Seleukid Empire. Eruptions are also followed by socioeconomic stress with increased hereditary land sales, and the issuance of priestly decrees to reinforce elite authority. Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agricultural regions, presently including 70% of world population.</li>

<ul>
<li>Dust provides ecosystem-sustaining nutrients to landscapes underlain by intensively weathered soils. Here we show that dust may also be crucial in montane forest ecosystems, dominating nutrient budgets despite continuous replacement of depleted soils with fresh bedrock via erosion. Strontium and neodymium isotopes in modern dust show that Asian sources contribute 18–45% of dust deposition across our Sierra Nevada, California study sites. The remaining dust originates regionally from the nearby Central Valley. Measured dust fluxes are greater than or equal to modern erosional outputs from hillslopes to channels, and account for 10–20% of estimated millennial-average inputs of bedrock P. Our results demonstrate that exogenic dust can drive the evolution of nutrient budgets in montane ecosystems, with implications for predicting forest response to changes in climate and land use.</li>

<ul>
<li>Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile and climate conditions.</li>
<li>In conclusion, this work has importance in three aspects; first, we have observed a new mechanism of bioaerosol generation caused by rain. Once bacteria are dispersed through aerosols, they can be transported by wind to other places much faster than other modes of transfer such as diffusion through soil. Second, we have identified experimental methods to collect and visualize aerosols including bacteria dispersed from soil. Using this method, we defined a new surface property denoted aerosolization efficiency, which describes how many bacteria can be transferred under given conditions. Third, we found that the mechanism of bacteria transfer by raindrops with bubble formation affected by surface temperature and impact speed. With understanding this mechanism, one can begin to develop methods of preventing or promoting bacterial transfer. As a result, we can predict the locations and environmental conditions that promote the transfer of bacteria from soil to air. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of bacteria transfer from soil to the environment. This mechanism can be relevant for the investigation of climate change, pathogenic disease transmission and geographic migration of bacteria.p</li>

<li>Climate variability alters nitrogen cycling, primary productivity, and dissolved oxygen concentration in marine ecosystems. We examined the role of this variability (as measured by six variables) on food chain length (FCL) in the California Current (CC) by reconstructing a time series of amino acid–specific δ15N values derived from common dolphins, an apex pelagic predator, and using two FCL proxies. Strong declines in FCL were observed after the 1997–1999 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Bayesian models revealed longer FCLs under intermediate conditions for surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, multivariate ENSO index, and total plankton volume but not for hypoxic depth and nitrate concentration. Our results challenge the prevalent paradigm that suggested long-term stability in the food web structure in the CC and, instead, reveal that pelagic food webs respond strongly to disturbances associated with ENSO events, local oceanography, and ongoing changes in climate.</li>

<p><em>hydrothermal vents trigger massive phytoplankton blooms in the southern ocean</em><br />

<p>the first observed evidence of iron from the Southern Ocean's depths turning normally anemic surface waters into hotspots for phytoplankton -- the tiny algae that sustain the marine food web, pull heat-trapping carbon dioxide out of the air and produce a huge amount of the oxygen we breathe. &quot;Our study shows that iron from hydrothermal vents can well up, travel across hundreds of miles of open ocean and allow phytoplankton to thrive in some very unexpected places,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kevin Arrigo, a professor of Earth system science and senior author of the paper, called the findings &quot;important because they show how intimately linked the deep ocean and surface ocean can be.&quot;</p>
<p>Mysterious blooms</p>
<p>Phytoplankton need iron to thrive, and that limits their abundance in vast swaths of the ocean where concentrations of the nutrient are low. But when conditions are right, phytoplankton can also grow explosively, blooming across thousands of square miles in a matter of days.</p>
<p>That's what Ardyna noticed recently as he looked at data recorded in 2014 and 2015 by a fleet of floating robots outfitted with optical sensors in the Southern Ocean. More than 1,300 miles off the coast of Antarctica and 1,400 miles from the African continent, two unexpectedly large blooms cropped up in an area known for severe iron shortages and low concentrations of chlorophyll, an indicator of phytoplankton populations.</p>
<p>Massive blooms in this region could only be possible with an influx of iron. Ardyna and Arrigo quickly ruled out the ocean's most common sources, including continental shelves, melting sea ice and atmospheric dust, which were simply too far away to have much influence.</p>
<p>That led them to suspect that the nutrient must be welling up from below, possibly from a string of hydrothermal vents that dot a mid-ocean ridge 750 miles from where the massive blooms had inexplicably appeared. To help test their hypothesis, they recruited an international team of collaborators specialized in various aspects of oceanography and modeling.</p>
<p>&quot;It has long been known that hydrothermal vents create unique and profound oases of life,&quot; Ardyna said. Until recently, scientists generally believed those nourishing effects remained fairly local. But a growing amount of evidence from computer simulations of ocean dynamics has hinted that iron and other life-sustaining elements spewed from hydrothermal vents may in fact fuel planktonic blooms over much wider areas.</p>
<p>However, direct measurements have been lacking.</p>
<p>In the Southern Ocean, that's partly due to the remote location, extreme cold and rough seas, which make it difficult to study up close or collect accurate data. &quot;Your sensors have to be in the right place at the right time to see these blooms,&quot; Ardyna said. &quot;Satellites can underestimate intensity or miss them altogether because of bad coverage or strong mixing of the water column, which pushes phytoplankton down too deep for satellites to see.&quot;</p>
<p>Clues from space, floating robots</p>
<p>To track the flow of particles from the vents on the mid-ocean ridge, the scientists analyzed data from satellites measuring chlorophyll and from autonomous, sensor-laden buoys known as Argo floats. As they dive and drift along ocean currents, some of these buoys detect chlorophyll and other proxies for phytoplankton biomass. &quot;The floats give us precious and unique data, covering a large section of the water column down to 1,000 meters deep during an entire annual cycle,&quot; Ardyna said.</p>
<p>The scientists couldn't directly measure iron in the water, but instead analyzed measurements of helium collected by scientific cruises in the 1990s. The presence of helium signals waters influenced by hydrothermal vents, which funnel large amounts of primordial helium from beneath Earth's crust.</p>
<p>The chlorophyll, phytoplankton and helium data suggest that a powerful current circling Antarctica grabs nutrients rising up from vents. Two turbulent, fast-moving branches of the current then shuttle the nutrients eastward for a month or two before serving them like a banquet to undernourished phytoplankton. Together with the arrival of spring sunshine that phytoplankton need for photosynthesis, the delivery triggers a massive bloom that can likely absorb and store significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, said Arrigo, who is also the Donald and Donald M. Steel Professor in Earth Sciences.</p>
<p>Over time, the blooms drift eastward toward the current racing around Antarctica and fade as sea creatures devour them. &quot;We suspect these hotspots are either consumed or exported to deep waters,&quot; Ardyna said.</p>
<p>Each bloom lasts little more than a month, but the mechanisms that trigger them are likely to be more common in the global ocean than scientists previously suspected.</p>
<p>&quot;Hydrothermal vents are scattered all over the ocean floor,&quot; Ardyna said. Knowing about the pathways that bring their nutrients up to surface waters will help researchers make more accurate calculations about the flow of carbon in the world's oceans. &quot;Much remains to be done to reveal other potential hotspots and quantify how this mechanism is altering the carbon cycle.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Hydrothermal activity is significant in regulating the dynamics of trace elements in the ocean. Biogeochemical models suggest that hydrothermal iron might play an important role in the iron-depleted Southern Ocean by enhancing the biological pump. However, the ability of this mechanism to affect large-scale biogeochemistry and the pathways by which hydrothermal iron reach the surface layer have not been observationally constrained. Here we present the first observational evidence of upwelled hydrothermally influenced deep waters stimulating massive phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean. Captured by profiling floats, two blooms were observed in the vicinity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, downstream of active hydrothermal vents along the Southwest Indian Ridge. These hotspots of biological activity are supported by mixing of hydrothermally sourced iron stimulated by flow-topography interactions. Such findings reveal the important role of hydrothermal vents on surface biogeochemistry, potentially fueling local hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO2 by enhancing the biological pump.</p>

<ul>
<li>Predicting how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect the hydrologic cycle is of utmost importance for a range of applications ranging from ecological services to human life and activities. A typical perspective is that hydrologic change is driven by precipitation and radiation changes due to climate change, and that the land surface will adjust. Using Earth system models with decoupled surface (vegetation physiology) and atmospheric (radiative) CO2 responses, we here show that the CO2 physiological response has a dominant role in evapotranspiration and evaporative fraction changes and has a major effect on long-term runoff compared with radiative or precipitation changes due to increased atmospheric CO2. This major effect is true for most hydrological stress variables over the largest fraction of the globe, except for soil moisture, which exhibits a more nonlinear response. This highlights the key role of vegetation in controlling future terrestrial hydrologic response and emphasizes that the carbon and water cycles are intimately coupled over land.</li>

<ul>
<li>Upon landfall, atmospheric rivers (ARs)—plumes of intense water vapor transport—often trigger weather and hydrologic extremes. Presently, no guidance is available to alert decision makers to anomalous AR activity within the subseasonal time scale (~2–5 weeks). Here, we construct and evaluate an empirical prediction scheme for anomalous AR activity based solely on the initial state of two prominent modes of tropical variability: the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The MJO—the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropical troposphere—modulates landfalling AR activity along the west coast of North America by exciting large-scale circulation anomalies over the North Pacific. In light of emerging science regarding the modulation of the MJO by the QBO—the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical stratosphere—we demonstrate that the MJO–AR relationship is further influenced by the QBO. Evaluating the prediction scheme over 36 boreal winter seasons, we find skillful subseasonal “forecasts of opportunity” when knowledge of the MJO and the QBO can be leveraged to predict periods of increased or decreased AR activity. Certain MJO and QBO phase combinations provide empirical subseasonal predictive skill for anomalous AR activity that exceeds that of a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. Given the wide-ranging impacts associated with landfalling ARs, even modest gains in the subseasonal prediction of anomalous AR activity may support decision making and benefit numerous sectors of society.</li>

<ul>
<li>Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow and elongated bands of anomalous water vapour transport that have been widely studied due to their notable influence on regional weather patterns, surface hydrology, and the global water cycle. Although ARs produce a relatively large proportion of the annual precipitation in the southeastern quadrant of the United States, a detailed climatological analysis of Southeastern atmospheric rivers (SE-ARs) has not been conducted. In this study, a climatology of SE-AR coastal interactions from 1979 to 2014 was constructed from a global AR data set to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of SE-ARs as well as the importance of synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability in modulating their frequency. The climatology revealed that SE-ARs were most prevalent during the cold season, with the majority of these wintertime coastal interactions occurring predominately in the Gulf of Mexico. The synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability favourable for SE-AR development differed depending on the season and sub-region of the Southeast considered. More specifically, a dipole effect was discovered, as conditions conducive for SE-AR coastal interactions along the western Gulf generally inhibited SE-AR interactions with the Florida Peninsula and vice versa. Overall, a better understanding of the seasonality of SE-ARs as well as the synoptic-scale and low-frequency modes of climate variability that encourage their development could lead to improved forecasting and community awareness of the devastating AR-related flood events that occur throughout the Southeast.</li>

<li>Changes in the sea-level annual cycle (SLAC) can have profound impacts on coastal areas, including increased flooding risk and ecosystem alteration, yet little is known about the magnitude and drivers of such changes. Here we show, using novel Bayesian methods, that there are significant decadal fluctuations in the amplitude of the SLAC along the United States Gulf and Southeast coasts, including an extreme event in 2008–2009 that is likely (probability ≥68%) unprecedented in the tide-gauge record. Such fluctuations are coherent along the coast but decoupled from deep-ocean changes. Through the use of numerical and analytical ocean models, we show that the primary driver of these fluctuations involves incident Rossby waves that generate fast western-boundary waves. These Rossby waves project onto the basin-wide upper mid-ocean transport (top 1000 m) leading to a link with the SLAC, wherein larger SLAC amplitudes coincide with enhanced transport variability.</li>

<li>Rossby waves are a type of global-scale wave that develops in planetary atmospheres, driven by the planet’s rotation<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref1">13</a>.

Despite the massive reservoir of rotational energy available in the Sun’s interior and decades of observational investigation, their solar analogue defies unambiguous identification<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref4">16</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref5">17</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref6">18</a>. Here we analyse a combined set of images obtained by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft between 2011 and 2013 in order to follow the evolution of small bright features, called brightpoints, which are tracers of rotationally driven large-scale convection<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0086#ref7">19</a>. We report the detection of persistent, global-scale bands of magnetized activity on the Sun that slowly meander westward in longitude and display Rossby-wave-like behaviour. These magnetized Rossby waves allow us to make direct connections between decadal-scale solar activity and that on much shorter timescales. Monitoring the properties of these waves, and the wavenumber of the disturbances that they generate, has the potential to yield a considerable improvement in forecast capability for solar activity and related space weather phenomena.</li>

<li>
<p>In contrast to leveraging incoming energy as a normal solar cell would, the negative illumination effect allows electrical energy to be harvested as heat leaves a surface. Today's technology, though, does not capture energy over these negative temperature differences as efficiently.</p>
<p>By pointing their device toward space, whose temperature approaches mere degrees from absolute zero, the group was able to find a great enough temperature difference to generate power through an early design.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount of power that we can generate with this experiment, at the moment, is far below what the theoretical limit is,&quot; said Masashi Ono, another author on the paper.</p>
<p>The group found that their negative illumination diode generated about 64 nanowatts per square meter, a tiny amount of electricity, but an important proof of concept, that the authors can improve on by enhancing the quantum optoelectronic properties of the materials they use.</p>
<p>Calculations made after the diode created electricity showed that, when atmospheric effects are taken into consideration, the current device can theoretically generate almost 4 watts per square meter, roughly one million times what the group's device generated and enough to help power machinery that is required to run at night.</p>
<p>By comparison, today's solar panels generate 100 to 200 watts per square meter.</p>
<p>While the results show promise for ground-based devices directed to the sky, Fan said the same principle could be used to recover waste heat from machines. For now, he and his group are focusing on improving their device's performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> We experimentally demonstrate electric power generation from the coldness of the universe directly, using the negative illumination effect when an infrared semiconductor diode faces the sky. Our theoretical model, accounting for the experimental results, indicates that the performance of such a power generation scheme is strongly influenced by the degree of matching between the responsivity spectrum and the atmospheric transparency window, as well as the quantum efficiency of the diode. A Shockley-Queisser analysis of an ideal optimized diode, taking into consideration the realistic transmissivity spectrum of the atmosphere, indicates the theoretical maximum power density of 3.99 W/m2 with the diode temperature at 293 K. The results here point to a pathway towards night-time power generation.</p>

<p>Cooling below room temperature</p>
<p>The results of a recent experiment carried out by the research group of Prof. Andreas Schilling in the Department of Physics at the University of Zurich (UZH) appear at first sight to challenge the second law of thermodynamics. The researchers managed to cool a nine-gram piece of copper from over 100°C to significantly below room temperature without an external power supply. &quot;Theoretically, this experimental device could turn boiling water to ice, without using any energy,&quot; says Schilling.</p>
<p>Creating oscillating heat currents</p>
<p>To achieve this, the researchers used a Peltier element, a component commonly used, for example, to cool minibars in hotel rooms. These elements can transform electric currents into temperature differences. The researchers had already used this type of element in previous experiments, in connection with an electric inductor, to create an oscillating heat current in which the flow of heat between two bodies perpetually changed direction. In this scenario, heat also temporarily flows from a colder to a warmer object so that the colder object is cooled down further. This kind of &quot;thermal oscillating circuit&quot; in effect contains a &quot;thermal inductor.&quot; It functions in the same way as an electrical oscillating circuit, in which the voltage oscillates with a constantly changing sign.</p>
<p>Laws of physics remain intact</p>
<p>Until now, Schilling's team had only operated these thermal oscillating circuits using an energy source. The researchers have now shown for the first time that this kind of thermal oscillating circuit can also be operated &quot;passively,&quot; i.e. with no external power supply. Thermal oscillations still occurred and, after a while, heat flowed directly from the colder copper to a warmer heat bath with a temperature of 22°C, without being temporarily transformed into another form of energy. Despite this, the authors were also able to show that the process does not actually contradict any laws of physics. To prove it, they considered the change in entropy of the whole system and showed that it increased with time -- fully in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Potential application still a long way off</p>
<p>Although the team recorded a difference of only about 2°C compared to the ambient temperature in the experiment, this was mainly due to the performance limitations of the commercial Peltier element used. According to Schilling, it would be possible in theory to achieve cooling of up to -47°C under the same conditions, if the &quot;ideal&quot; Peltier element -- yet to be invented -- could be used: &quot;With this very simple technology, large amounts of hot solid, liquid or gaseous materials could be cooled to well below room temperature without any energy consumption.&quot;</p>
<p>The passive thermal circuit could also be used as often as desired, without the need to connect it to a power supply. However, Schilling admits that a large-scale application of the technique is still a long way off. One reason for this is that the Peltier elements currently available are not efficient enough. Furthermore, the current set-up requires the use of superconducting inductors to minimize electric losses.</p>
<p>Established perceptions challenged</p>
<p>The UZH physicist considers the work more significant than a mere &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; study: &quot;At first sight, the experiments appear to be a kind of thermodynamic magic, thereby challenging to some extent our traditional perceptions of the flow of heat.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The cooling of boiling water all the way down to freezing, by thermally connecting it to a thermal bath held at ambient temperature without external intervention, would be quite unexpected. We describe the equivalent of a “thermal inductor,” composed of a Peltier element and an electric inductance, which can drive the temperature difference between two bodies to change sign by imposing inertia on the heat flowing between them, and enable continuing heat transfer from the chilling body to its warmer counterpart without the need of an external driving force. We demonstrate its operation in an experiment and show that the process can pass through a series of quasi-equilibrium states while fully complying with the second law of thermodynamics. This thermal inductor extends the analogy between electrical and thermal circuits and could serve, with further progress in thermoelectric materials, to cool hot materials well below ambient temperature without external energy supplies or moving parts.</p>

<p>&quot;This is an experiment in which we make a one-way route for sound waves,&quot; said Harris, a Yale physics professor and the study's principal investigator. &quot;Specifically, we have two acoustic resonators. Sound stored in the first resonator can leak into the second, but not vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>Harris said his team was able to achieve the result with a &quot;tuning knob&quot; -- a laser setting, actually -- that can weaken or strengthen a sound wave, depending on the sound wave's direction.</p>
<p>Then the researchers took their experiment to a different level. Because heat consists mostly of vibrations, they applied the same ideas to the flow of heat from one object to another.</p>
<p>&quot;By using our one-way sound trick, we can make heat flow from point A to point B, or from B to A, regardless of which one is colder or hotter,&quot; Harris said. &quot;This would be like dropping an ice cube into a glass of hot water and having the ice cubes get colder and colder while the water around them gets warmer and warmer. Then, by changing a single setting on our laser, heat is made to flow the usual way, and the ice cubes gradually warm and melt while the liquid water cools a bit. Though in our experiments it's not ice cubes and water that are exchanging heat, but rather two acoustic resonators.&quot;</p>
<p>Although some of the most basic examples of acoustic resonators are found in musical instruments or even automobile exhaust pipes, they're also found in a variety of electronics. They are used as sensors, filters, and transducers because of their compatibility with a wide range of materials, frequencies, and fabrication processes.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Mechanical resonators are important components of devices that range from gravitational wave detectors to cellular telephones. They serve as high-performance transducers, sensors and filters by offering low dissipation, tunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide range of frequencies, materials and fabrication processes. Systems of mechanical resonators typically obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon transmission coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the direction of transmission1,2. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices (such as isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic energy between resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active elements, mitigating noise and operating full-duplex transceivers. Until now, nonreciprocal phononic devices3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have not simultaneously combined the features necessary for robust operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact integration and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only to coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized exclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators). Here we describe a scheme that uses the standard cavity-optomechanical interaction to produce robust nonreciprocal coupling between phononic resonators. This scheme provides about 30 decibels of isolation in continuous operation and can be tuned in situ simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to the cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring the dynamics of the resonators we show that this nonreciprocity can control thermal fluctuations, and that this control represents a way to cool phononic resonators.</p>

<p><em>needle-like structures discovered on positively charged lightning branches</em><br />

<p>In contrast to popular belief, lightning often does strike twice, but the reason why a lightning channel is 'reused' has remained a mystery. Now, an international research team led by the University of Groningen has used the LOFAR radio telescope to study the development of lightning flashes in unprecedented detail. Their work reveals that the negative charges inside a thundercloud are not discharged all in a single flash, but are in part stored alongside the leader channel at Interruptions. This occurs inside structures which the researchers have called needles. Through these needles, a negative charge may cause a repeated discharge to the ground. The results were published on 18 April in the science journal Nature.</p>
<p>Needles</p>
<p>&quot;This finding is in sharp contrast to the present picture, in which the charge flows along plasma channels directly from one part of the cloud to another, or to the ground,&quot; explains Olaf Scholten, Professor of Physics at the KVI-CART institute of the University of Groningen. The reason why the needles have never been seen before lies in the 'supreme capabilities' of LOFAR, adds his colleague Dr Brian Hare, first author of the paper: &quot;These needles can have a length of 100 meters and a diameter of less than five meters, and are too small and too short-lived for other lightning detections systems.&quot;</p>
<p>Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is a Dutch radio telescope consisting of thousands of rather simple antennas spread out over Northern Europe. These antennas are connected with a central computer through fiber-optic cables, which means that they can operate as a single entity. LOFAR is developed primarily for radio astronomy observations, but the frequency range of the antennas also makes it suitable for lightning research, as discharges produce bursts in the VHF (very high frequency) radio band.</p>
<p>Inside the cloud</p>
<p>For the present lightning observations, the scientists have used only the Dutch LOFAR stations, which cover an area of 3,200 square kilometers. This new study analyzed the raw time-traces (which are accurate to one nanosecond) as measured in the 30-80 MHz band. Brian Hare: &quot;These data allow us to detect lightning propagation at a scale where, for the first time, we can distinguish the primary processes. Furthermore, the use of radio waves allows us to look inside the thundercloud, where most of the lightning resides.&quot;</p>
<p>Lightning occurs when strong updrafts generate a kind of static electricity in large cumulonimbus clouds. Parts of the cloud become positively charged and others negatively. When this charge separation is large enough, a violent discharge happens, which we know as lightning. Such a discharge starts with a plasma, a small area of ionized air hot enough to be electrically conductive. This small area grows into a forked plasma channel that can reach lengths of several kilometers. The positive tips of the plasma channel collect negative charges from the cloud, which pass through the channel to the negative tip, where the charge is discharged. It was already known that a large amount of VHF emissions is produced at the growing tips of the negative channels while the positive channels show emissions only along the channel, not at the tip.</p>
<p>A new algorithm</p>
<p>The scientists developed a new algorithm for LOFAR data, allowing them to visualize the VHF radio emissions from two lightning flashes. The antenna array and the very precise time stamp on all the data allowed them to pinpoint the emission sources with unprecedented resolution. &quot;Close to the core area of LOFAR, where the antenna density is highest, the spatial accuracy was about one meter,&quot; says Professor Scholten. Furthermore, the data obtained was capable of localizing 10 times more VHF sources than other three-dimensional imaging systems, with a temporal resolution in the range of nanoseconds. This resulted in a high-resolution 3D image of the lightning discharge.</p>
<p>Break</p>
<p>The results clearly show the occurrence of a break in the discharge channel, at a location where needles are formed. These appear to discharge negative charges from the main channel, which subsequently re-enter the cloud. The reduction of charges in the channel causes the break. However, once the charge in the cloud becomes high enough again, the flow through the channel is restored, leading to a second discharge of lightning. By this mechanism, lightning will strike in the same area repeatedly.</p>
<p>Scholten: &quot;The VHF emissions along the positive channel are due to rather regularly repeated discharges along previously formed side channels, the needles. These needles appear to drain the charges in a pulsed manner.&quot; This is a totally new phenomenon, adds Professor Joe Dwyer of the University of New Hampshire (US), third author of the paper: &quot;Our new observation techniques show copious amounts of needles in the lightning flash, which have not been seen before.&quot; And Brian Hare concludes: &quot;From these observations, we see that a part of the cloud is re-charged, and we can understand why a lightning discharge to the ground may repeat itself a few times.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Lightning is a dangerous yet poorly understood natural phenomenon. Lightning forms a network of plasma channels propagating away from the initiation point with both positively and negatively charged ends—called positive and negative leaders1. Negative leaders propagate in discrete steps, emitting copious radio pulses in the 30–300-megahertz frequency band2,3,4,5,6,7,8 that can be remotely sensed and imaged with high spatial and temporal resolution9,10,11. Positive leaders propagate more continuously and thus emit very little high-frequency radiation12. Radio emission from positive leaders has nevertheless been mapped13,14,15, and exhibits a pattern that is different from that of negative leaders11,12,13,16,17. Furthermore, it has been inferred that positive leaders can become transiently disconnected from negative leaders9,12,16,18,19,20, which may lead to current pulses that both reconnect positive leaders to negative leaders11,16,17,20,21,22 and cause multiple cloud-to-ground lightning events1. The disconnection process is thought to be due to negative differential resistance18, but this does not explain why the disconnections form primarily on positive leaders22, or why the current in cloud-to-ground lightning never goes to zero23. Indeed, it is still not understood how positive leaders emit radio-frequency radiation or why they behave differently from negative leaders. Here we report three-dimensional radio interferometric observations of lightning over the Netherlands with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We find small plasma structures—which we call ‘needles’—that are the dominant source of radio emission from the positive leaders. These structures appear to drain charge from the leader, and are probably the reason why positive leaders disconnect from negative ones, and why cloud-to-ground lightning connects to the ground multiple times.</p>

<p><em>vanadium disulfide flakes with nanolayered titanium disulfide coating as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries</em><br />
lu li et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09400-w">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09400-w</a></p>

<p>A lithium-ion battery charges and discharges as lithium ions move between two electrodes, called an anode and a cathode. In a traditional lithium-ion battery, the anode is made of graphite, while the cathode is composed of lithium cobalt oxide.</p>
<p>These materials perform well together, which is why lithium-ion batteries have become increasingly popular, but researchers at Rensselaer believe the function can be enhanced further.</p>
<p>&quot;The way to make batteries better is to improve the materials used for the electrodes,&quot; said Nikhil Koratkar, professor of mechanical, aerospace, and nuclear engineering at Rensselaer, and corresponding author of the paper. &quot;What we are trying to do is make lithium-ion technology even better in performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Koratkar's extensive research into nanotechnology and energy storage has placed him among the most highly cited researchers in the world. In this most recent work, Koratkar and his team improved performance by substituting cobalt oxide with vanadium disulfide (VS2).</p>
<p>&quot;It gives you higher energy density, because it's light. And it gives you faster charging capability, because it's highly conductive. From those points of view, we were attracted to this material,&quot; said Koratkar, who is also a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>Excitement surrounding the potential of VS2 has been growing in recent years, but until now, Koratkar said, researchers had been challenged by its instability -- a characteristic that would lead to short battery life. The Rensselaer researchers not only established why that instability was happening, but also developed a way to combat it.</p>
<p>The team, which also included Vincent Meunier, head of the Department of Physics, Applied Physics, and Astronomy, and others, determined that lithium insertion caused an asymmetry in the spacing between vanadium atoms, known as Peierls distortion, which was responsible for the breakup of the VS2 flakes. They discovered that covering the flakes with a nanolayered coating of titanium disulfide (TiS2) -- a material that does not Peierls distort -- would stabilize the VS2 flakes and improve their performance within the battery.</p>
<p>&quot;This was new. People hadn't realized this was the underlying cause,&quot; Koratkar said. &quot;The TiS2 coating acts as a buffer layer. It holds the VS2 material together, providing mechanical support.&quot;</p>
<p>Once that problem was solved, the team found that the VS2-TiS2 electrodes could operate at a high specific capacity, or store a lot of charge per unit mass. Koratkar said that vanadium and sulfur's small size and weight allow them to deliver a high capacity and energy density. Their small size would also contribute to a compact battery.</p>
<p>When charging was done more quickly, Koratkar said, the capacity didn't dip as significantly as it often does with other electrodes. The electrodes were able to maintain a reasonable capacity because, unlike cobalt oxide, the VS2-TiS2 material is electrically conductive.</p>
<p>Koratkar sees multiple applications for this discovery in improving car batteries, power for portable electronics, and solar energy storage where high capacity is important, but increased charging speed would also be attractive.</p>

<li>entropy
<ul>
<li>I dispute that entropy is fundamental to the universe. I just don't like it, just as I don't like schrödinger's cat.</li>
<li>the worship of order over seeming disorder is mistaken. odum knew as much when he criticised people for assuming nature to be simple rather than a complex ordered system. in almost the reverse of this, I believe we may be mistaken that complexity is a desired outcome, even though odum admits simplicity has its place. I believe they are our categories which are not really relevant to reality outside of our conception of it.</li>
<li>it could be that humans are supposed to have this explosive growth (if you believe in probability) so that at least a few of us are well adapted in the darwinian sense to the environment of the earth after humankind crashes to sustainable levels again.</li>
<li>it is an error to believe that all explosive growth is bad, perhaps sometimes it is necessary in order to overcome some obstacle that could best be overcome in this way.</li>
<li>odum assumes overpopulation is necessary for selection, as is the death of some of that overpopulation. I think it suffices that some do not reproduce, but the assumption that it is the best that reproduce is erroneous and self–serving.</li>
<li>it is an illusion of human desire for control and order that the desired theory to represent reality should be based on those principles.</li>
<li>most people believe that they need these principles to be true for them (the people) to survive. this is untrue. they are addicted to those principles and this type of addiction leads them to believe in this way. this could be the main reason why it can be difficult for people to get to grips with what we say — if this challenges this addictive belief, but they cannot overcome their addiction, they will not be able to change their belief. so again it comes down to what kind of person can already overcome their addiction and what people can do to learn how to do this. against this are arrayed abusive people who find it suits their way of life for most people to be addicted to their situation.</li>
<li>and to go on to why those people are abusive is the topic of the next section. i.e.:</li>
<li>people act abusively when they are in the habit of doing so. which means all sorts of things like how important our choices are because how we choose makes a great difference to whether and how we maintain habits. this is why so–called &quot;freedom&quot; is important. and closeness to current reality is not a common feature of habit.</li>
<li>so the process of becoming responsible is often at first similar to stopping an addictive habit like smoking.</li>

<li>momentum
<ul>
<li>timing of effort
<ul>
<li>on the timing of effort as a major theme of the book, the “new way of thinking” that it introduces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>downward to forward
<ul>
<li>when serving overhead or for smashing forwards, doing the reversed sequence for high jumping i.e. jump high then land with leg angled behind to convert downward motion to forward motion will increase power of forward ball motion in addition to swing. this technique will work for all similar actions such as martial arts punches kicks etc.</li>
<li>“reverse jump” used to change downward momentum for karate chop</li>
<li>walking and running are really falling forwards in a controlled manner. if we want to run faster, allow this falling to occur more rapidly by taking lots of small steps quickly rather than trying to push with legs. this is how we can run long distances with low energy expenditure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>forward to up
<ul>
<li>upward momentum from converting forward momentum of body at running speed to body moving upwards with low forward speed</li>
<li>forward to up for high kick</li>
<li>same applies for walking and running uphill — convert some of the forward momentum from falling forwards into upward momentum so you are not pushing all the way uphill</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>jump angle for rejump
<ul>
<li>if landing, say between 45° and 90° of horizontal, is momentum once again transferred upwards? this would help rejump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vertical descent
<ul>
<li>if coming down vertical surface, can use same principle to slow descent using that surface? i.e. does lower foot transfer momentum in, towards surface, so can use upper to slow using friction on surface? and if well trained, can we keep doing this some way down the surface?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>increasing apparent weight
<ul>
<li>bagua
<ul>
<li>in a similar manner to vertical descent converting momentum in one plane to momentum in perpendicular plane, the same effect occurs in martial arts where in <em>bagua</em> for example, motion in a horizontal plane augments downward force when it is converted by the action of the lower body — this is used to seemingly make the body <em>weigh</em> more and be more rooted to the ground. the intention is the same, all that is different is the way of describing it in words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bus surfing
<ul>
<li>again in a similar manner, bus surfing converts for example forward momentum when person standing in a decelerating bus is converted by an angled front foot into downward momentum applied through mostly the rear foot, increasing friction and thus steadiness of the standing rider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>wavelike
<ul>
<li>diving through the crest of a wave in surf is like a kick–turn in swimming — when you know a good place and means to insert effort or change tack it can be super–effective. sometimes the situation is manmade, like a swimming pool, but more often it is natural like a wave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rolling momentum
<ul>
<li>on a bicycle, start pedaling faster on approach to hill — gradually faster until at maximum speed at base of hill. keep pedaling on the upward slope while gradually changing gear. this is the quickest and most effective way to pedal up a hill</li>
<li>keep forward motion steady by using an even cadence on pedals, as trying to speed up after deceleration is harder than keeping up a steady speed</li>
<li>small regular fast steps are particularly good for keeping momentum moving as it is like pushing stroke during fastest phase of swimming — least effort is expended for maximum effect, and rather than requiring energy to be diverted to repeated re–acceleration, it can be used sparingly to continue forward motion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>swinging momentum
<ul>
<li>momentum when swinging from handhold to handhold — body to keep moving forward</li>
