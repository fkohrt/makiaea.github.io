<p>haha that made me laugh! that's what happens when I draw anything — a generic representation by rules — the eyes are about here for this, this kind of dragon has four toes… playing piano I can do from “memory” but it’s a detailed relation between one note and the rest in the chord, and then the next… it can be very fast but it’s not recall, more like redoing? also interested in non–narrative “non–sensory” recall — I know when something is unjust but not by rationalisation. I think aphantasia is probably simplifying things quite a bit…</p>
<p>I just now read the new scientist article about it — “Kosslyn thinks the drawing sensation gives us a clue as to how aphantasics deal with apparently pictorial information. He suggests that to complete these tasks I am piggybacking on neurons involved in controlling physical movements rather than using the visual brain circuitry.” whoa.</p>
<p>seriously, this is probably more common than people realise — I have (relatively) useful adaptation mechanisms, others probably do too. also great from a diversity point of view…</p>
<p>I would like to study the coping/adaptation mechanisms that people use to compensate. also what advantages it gives</p>
<p>so my hunch is this is to do with the rebuilding of experience as we recall it — I can understand that my recall is through infilling of visual elements through an underlying process — but I don't “store” an image I store its components. I suspect in reality we all do this but people rationalize it differently — many people believe what they recall is what they saw</p>
<p>the chap in the article claims not to recall what happened to him during the day — I am not like that but my recall of what happened more than a few weeks ago is so sparse as to be almost non–existent. doesn't mean it's not in there somewhere, just I don't have ready access to it like other people do</p>
<p>or maybe I'm not so ready to believe that what story and scene I recall is actually a good representation of what actually happened</p>
<p>we are not questioning the basic assumption — our language assumes recall is sensory–based rather than something else. fmri studies of brain blood flow show brain blood flow — we are assuming our interpretation of the flow is correct, that when a similar region “lights up” on recall, the recall has identity with the initial experience</p>
<p>psychologists know recall is not initial experience, but not many people (psychologist or other) articulate that our “description of recall” is not recall — or do they,</p>
<p>we are not so different to those whose cultures have “three colours”. we have more words for more colours… seems I am with the “relativists” like John Lucy: “It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate</p>
<p>we say “the triangle was red” not “the triangle had … with a wavelength of …” — we “reconstruct” “red”, which is not “a wavelength of…” and that’s just the colour term — what about “triangle” and “was”?</p>

<p><em>a mega-analysis of memory reports from eight peer-reviewed false memory implantation studies</em><br />

<li>Understanding that suggestive practices can promote false beliefs and false memories for childhood events is important in many settings (e.g., psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal). The generalisability of findings from memory implantation studies has been questioned due to variability in estimates across studies. Such variability is partly due to false memories having been operationalised differently across studies and to differences in memory induction techniques. We explored ways of defining false memory based on memory science and developed a reliable coding system that we applied to reports from eight published implantation studies (<em>N</em> <em>=</em> 423). Independent raters coded transcripts using seven criteria: accepting the suggestion, elaboration beyond the suggestion, imagery, coherence, emotion, memory statements, and not rejecting the suggestion. Using this scheme, 30.4% of cases were classified as false memories and another 23% were classified as having accepted the event to some degree. When the suggestion included self-relevant information, an imagination procedure, and was not accompanied by a photo depicting the event, the memory formation rate was 46.1%. Our research demonstrates a useful procedure for systematically combining data that are not amenable to meta-analysis, and provides the most valid estimate of false memory formation and associated moderating factors within the implantation literature to date.</li>

<p><em>feelings of familiarity and false memory for specific associations resulting from mugshot exposure</em><br />

<ul>
<li>This research reveals that mugshot viewing accompanied by questions about an action can cause young adults to associate the pictured person and the queried action, leading to later false recollection of having seen that person perform that action. In contrast, mugshot viewing in older adults can lead to vague feelings of familiarity for the pictured person, encouraging older adults to later falsely recognize the pictured person performing any familiar action. Participants viewed events involving actors performing different actions and then were asked verbal questions about which actor had performed each action, with each question accompanied by mugshots of potential “perpetrators” of the action. In a later recognition test, older adults were more likely to falsely recognize a novel conjunction of a familiar actor and action if they had seen a mugshot of that actor, regardless of whether the mugshot had accompanied a question about that action. In contrast, young adults were more likely to falsely recognize a conjunction event only if it involved an actor whose mugshot had accompanied a question about that particular action. This effect remained when the analysis was limited to trials involving actors whose mugshots had not been previously selected, implicating false recollection rather than commitment effects.</li>

<p><em>preventing intrusive memories after trauma via a brief intervention involving tetris computer game play in the emergency department: a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial</em><br />

<li><strong>After psychological trauma, recurrent intrusive visual memories may be distressing and disruptive. Preventive interventions post trauma are lacking. Here we test a behavioural intervention after real-life trauma derived from cognitive neuroscience. We hypothesized that intrusive memories would be significantly reduced in number by an intervention involving a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris), via disrupting consolidation of sensory elements of trauma memory. The Tetris-based intervention (trauma memory reminder cue plus c. 20 min game play) vs attention-placebo control (written activity log for same duration) were both delivered in an emergency department within 6 h of a motor vehicle accident. The randomized controlled trial compared the impact on the number of intrusive trauma memories in the subsequent week (primary outcome). Results vindicated the efficacy of the Tetris-based intervention compared with the control condition: there were fewer intrusive memories overall, and time-series analyses showed that intrusion incidence declined more quickly. There were convergent findings on a measure of clinical post-trauma intrusion symptoms at 1 week, but not on other symptom clusters or at 1 month. Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that a larger trial, powered to detect differences at 1 month, is warranted. Participants found the intervention easy, helpful and minimally distressing. By translating emerging neuroscientific insights and experimental research into the real world, we offer a promising new low-intensity psychiatric intervention that could prevent debilitating intrusive memories following trauma.</strong></li>

<li>Memory is an adaptation to particular temporal properties of past events, such as the frequency of occurrence of a stimulus or the coincidence of multiple stimuli. In neurons, this adaptation can be understood in terms of a hierarchical system of molecular and cellular time windows, which collectively retain information from the past. We propose that this system makes various timescales of past experience simultaneously available for future adjustment of behavior. More generally, we propose that the ability to detect and respond to temporally structured information underlies the nervous system’s capacity to encode and store a memory at molecular, cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.</li>

•Mnemonic strategies for superior memory can be learned by naive subjects<br />
•Mnemonic training induces similarity with memory champion brain connectivity<br />
•Brain network dynamics of this effect differ between task and resting state</p>
<p>Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance. Here we assess functional brain network organization of 23 of the world’s most successful memory athletes and matched controls with fMRI during both task-free resting state baseline and active memory encoding. We demonstrate that, in a group of naive controls, functional connectivity changes induced by 6 weeks of mnemonic training were correlated with the network organization that distinguishes athletes from controls. During rest, this effect was mainly driven by connections between rather than within the visual, medial temporal lobe and default mode networks, whereas during task it was driven by connectivity within these networks. Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brain’s functional network organization to enable superior memory performance.</p>

<p><em>acoustic enhancement of sleep slow oscillations and concomitant memory improvement in older adults</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Acoustic stimulation methods applied during sleep in young adults can increase slow wave activity (SWA) and improve sleep-dependent memory retention. It is unknown whether this approach enhances SWA and memory in older adults, who generally have reduced SWA compared to younger adults. Additionally, older adults are at risk for age-related cognitive impairment and therefore may benefit from non-invasive interventions. The aim of this study was to determine if acoustic stimulation can increase SWA and improve declarative memory in healthy older adults. Thirteen participants 60–84 years old completed one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation in random order. During sleep, a real-time algorithm using an adaptive phase-locked loop modeled the phase of endogenous slow waves in midline frontopolar electroencephalographic recordings. Pulses of pink noise were delivered when the upstate of the slow wave was predicted. Each interval of five pulses (“ON interval”) was followed by a pause of approximately equal length (“OFF interval”). SWA during the entire sleep period was similar between stimulation and sham conditions, whereas SWA and spindle activity were increased during ON intervals compared to matched periods during the sham night. The increases in SWA and spindle activity were sustained across almost the entire five-pulse ON interval compared to matched sham periods. Verbal paired-associate memory was tested before and after sleep. Overnight improvement in word recall was significantly greater with acoustic stimulation compared to sham and was correlated with changes in SWA between ON and OFF intervals. Using the phase-locked-loop method to precisely target acoustic stimulation to the upstate of sleep slow oscillations, we were able to enhance SWA and improve sleep-dependent memory storage in older adults, which strengthens the theoretical link between sleep and age-related memory integrity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal cells are capable of driving and antagonizing behaviors of opposing valence. BLA neurons project to the central amygdala (CeA), which also participates in negative and positive behaviors. However, the CeA has primarily been studied as the site for negative behaviors, and the causal role for CeA circuits underlying appetitive behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we identify several genetically distinct populations of CeA neurons that mediate appetitive behaviors and dissect the BLA-to-CeA circuit for appetitive behaviors. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 1+ CeA neurons define a pathway for promoting appetitive behaviors, while R-spondin 2+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 2+ CeA neurons define a pathway for suppressing appetitive behaviors. These data reveal genetically defined neural circuits in the amygdala that promote and suppress appetitive behaviors analogous to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.</li>

<p><em>practice increases procedural errors after task interruption</em><br />

<li>Positive effects of practice are ubiquitous in human performance, but a finding from memory research suggests that negative effects are possible also. The finding is that memory for items on a list depends on the time interval between item presentations. This finding predicts a negative effect of practice on procedural performance under conditions of task interruption. As steps of a procedure are performed more quickly, memory for past performance should become less accurate, increasing the rate of skipped or repeated steps after an interruption. We found this effect, with practice generally improving speed and accuracy, but impairing accuracy after interruptions. The results show that positive effects of practice can interact with architectural constraints on episodic memory to have negative effects on performance. In practical terms, the results suggest that practice can be a risk factor for procedural errors in task environments with a high incidence of task interruption.</li>
<li>Compressed memory for past events is not the only mechanism that could mediate negative effects of practice on accuracy. Reason’s (1990) influential work on errors suggests two others, both linking elevated error rates to changes in routine. Practice could increase the strength of default steps or actions, increasing the error rate at choice points where the default happens to be incor- rect. Practice could also decrease the frequency of “attentional checks” on progress toward the goal, increasing the error rate when conditions dictate a change of course.</li>

<li>auditory recall
<ul>
<li>compare to jenny's memory, mine is quite sparse. now before I read research on non-western time-consciousness, and diana deutch's perfect pitch in tonal language speakers research, I wrote this off as faulty memory.</li>
<li>now however, in light of this research, we can positively review this.</li>
<li>firstly, if, as some recent research concludes, some people (confirmed mainly in non-western people) live more in the present than others, and given this, do not reprocess their long-term memories (and/or future plans) as much as others, then those memories should be correspondingly weaker. this seems to be the case in my memory.</li>
<li>interestingly, I do have some strong memories and they tend to be auditory-linked. while I may not be a typical subject in terms of diana's previous research (I.e. am not musically trained before age 5 nor fully native speaker of tonal language before age 5), it does point to a strong auditory influence in an otherwise sparse long-term memory.</li>
<li>interesting questions for further research might be, &quot;is (long-term) auditory memory stronger in speakers of tonal languages (than non-auditory memory and/or speakers of non-tonal languages?&quot; and &quot;what effect, if any, does a non-western experience of time have on (long-term) memory, and what effect, if any, does speaking a tonal language have on this?&quot;</li>
<li>do people specialise in certain ways (for example, music, memory) because of the way in which their recall systems are primed? by what means does this priming occur and what results from it?</li>

<li>we may know that we are being manipulated by the media and their handlers, but that is not the same as being able to do something about what we are immersed in, and how that effects our actions and beliefs — our culture effects us deeply in ways we don't understand, that we barely have the language or means to describe.</li>
