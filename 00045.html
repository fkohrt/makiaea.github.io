<h1>retrieve</h1>
<h2>often solutions come to me in the middle of the night, to problems that I didn't even know I was thinking about — this is when it is especially handy to have a system ready to take notes, ready to go at a moment's notice, so that you can catch the idea, set it down to retrieve it later</h2>
<h2>in dreaming, is memory suspended so that we do not overlay real memories with dream memories?</h2>
<ul>
<li>are the memories laid in sleep different from the ones when awake?</li>
</ul>
<h2>retrieve not same as store</h2>
<ul>
<li>am learning that a system enabling retrieval can be very different to a system suited to storage. now data in chunks located with recall triggers rather than in centralised mass by topic (for example now person associated with certain aspect of something, rather than generalised technology or books)</li>
</ul>
<h2>memory embellishment</h2>
<ul>
<li>it might be that i don't have a sparse memory — other people have memory embellishment that i lack. i seem to preserve and recall basic memories that are not embellished on recall, like a lot of people do</li>
<li>94% US professors believe they are “above average” as professors — study is not only wrong because of bias in selection, but if it were correct, up to 50% of respondents could actually be correct — what about them? it's all very well saying some are mistaken, but what about those who are correct?</li>
<li>false memories are part of our memory system — everyone has them and they are not an aberration. understanding this may improve relationships and influence our recall strategies</li>
<li>a lot of people seem to use narrative, but i seem to do this much less than most. for example, my memory and identity do not seem to be as strongly narrative–based as others are.</li>
<li>my memory is procedural, it excels at recalling procedures and paths. others have an episodic memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>study for recall</h2>
<ul>
<li>if generalise principle of studying–as–if–you–were–recalling helps performance, then we should not be studying as if for academic tests, as tests are rarely like recall situations in real life.</li>
<li>I want to learn and share the learning and to make notes efficiently as I go along reading, but I am also aware that this can sometimes get in the way of actually learning. for example it would be a good idea from the efficiency point of view, to write a mind map of each book as I read it, making each major section of the map the question that each section of the book tries to answer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>everyday review</h2>
<p>everyday learning</p>
<h2>auditory recall</h2>
<ul>
<li>compare to jenny's memory, mine is quite sparse. now before I read research on non-western time-consciousness, and diana deutch's perfect pitch in tonal language speakers research, I wrote this off as faulty memory.</li>
<li>now however, in light of this research, we can positively review this.</li>
<li>firstly, if, as some recent research concludes, some people (confirmed mainly in non-western people) live more in the present than others, and given this, do not reprocess their long-term memories (and/or future plans) as much as others, then those memories should be correspondingly weaker. this seems to be the case in my memory.</li>
<li>interestingly, I do have some strong memories and they tend to be auditory-linked. while I may not be a typical subject in terms of diana's previous research (I.e. am not musically trained before age 5 nor fully native speaker of tonal language before age 5), it does point to a strong auditory influence in an otherwise sparse long-term memory.</li>
<li>interesting questions for further research might be, &quot;is (long-term) auditory memory stronger in speakers of tonal languages (than non-auditory memory and/or speakers of non-tonal languages?&quot; and &quot;what effect, if any, does a non-western experience of time have on (long-term) memory, and what effect, if any, does speaking a tonal language have on this?&quot;</li>
<li>do people specialise in certain ways (for example, music, memory) because of the way in which their recall systems are primed? by what means does this priming occur and what results from it?</li>

<p>haha that made me laugh! that's what happens when I draw anything — a generic representation by rules — the eyes are about here for this, this kind of dragon has four toes… playing piano I can do from “memory” but it’s a detailed relation between one note and the rest in the chord, and then the next… it can be very fast but it’s not recall, more like redoing? also interested in non–narrative “non–sensory” recall — I know when something is unjust but not by rationalisation. I think aphantasia is probably simplifying things quite a bit…</p>
<p>I just now read the new scientist article about it — “Kosslyn thinks the drawing sensation gives us a clue as to how aphantasics deal with apparently pictorial information. He suggests that to complete these tasks I am piggybacking on neurons involved in controlling physical movements rather than using the visual brain circuitry.” whoa.</p>
<p>seriously, this is probably more common than people realise — I have (relatively) useful adaptation mechanisms, others probably do too. also great from a diversity point of view…</p>
<p>I would like to study the coping/adaptation mechanisms that people use to compensate. also what advantages it gives</p>
<p>so my hunch is this is to do with the rebuilding of experience as we recall it — I can understand that my recall is through infilling of visual elements through an underlying process — but I don't “store” an image I store its components. I suspect in reality we all do this but people rationalize it differently — many people believe what they recall is what they saw</p>
<p>the chap in the article claims not to recall what happened to him during the day — I am not like that but my recall of what happened more than a few weeks ago is so sparse as to be almost non–existent. doesn't mean it's not in there somewhere, just I don't have ready access to it like other people do</p>
<p>or maybe I'm not so ready to believe that what story and scene I recall is actually a good representation of what actually happened</p>
<p>we are not questioning the basic assumption — our language assumes recall is sensory–based rather than something else. fmri studies of brain blood flow show brain blood flow — we are assuming our interpretation of the flow is correct, that when a similar region “lights up” on recall, the recall has identity with the initial experience</p>
<p>psychologists know recall is not initial experience, but not many people (psychologist or other) articulate that our “description of recall” is not recall — or do they,</p>
<p>we are not so different to those whose cultures have “three colours”. we have more words for more colours… seems I am with the “relativists” like John Lucy: “It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate</p>
<p>we say “the triangle was red” not “the triangle had … with a wavelength of …” — we “reconstruct” “red”, which is not “a wavelength of…” and that’s just the colour term — what about “triangle” and “was”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessing complex situations — it's like being able to speed–read rather than reading by sounding each word in my mind</p>
<p>generally not as attached to concepts that other people use as the basis for their values, including appearance — but rather more attached to things like honesty and responsibility. could be just me though…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>if we don't have a word or label for something, does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>if we do not have the concept of grey or greyish (some cultures do not, it seems) does this mean we cannot describe it, cannot recall it, cannot experience it?</li>
<li>if we are taught that “foreigners are the enemy” but haven’t learned what an “oligarch” or an “abuser” is, who would we fight for or against?</li>
<li>we may know that we are being manipulated by the media and their handlers, but that is not the same as being able to do something about what we are immersed in, and how that effects our actions and beliefs — our culture effects us deeply in ways we don't understand, that we barely have the language or means to describe.</li>
<li>liberals might congratulate themselves on understanding great chunks of reality that conservatives do not deal with, like climate change, racism, sexism — but there are whole mountains, continents of reality out there, of abuse and responsibility, with people already living there and willing to share, and someday we too will learn how</li>
