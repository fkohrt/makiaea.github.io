<p><em>irrationality</em><br />

<ul>
<li>cognitive luck
<ul>
<li>“One of the reasons why the notion of bounded rationality is challenged, and more idealized notions of rationality are advocated, is to avoid the phenomenon of cognitive luck, according to which decisions are rational only because the strategy used to arrive at the decision happens to match the structure of the environment in which the decision is made (Matheson 2006). If rationality is a matter of luck, then the prospect for improving our cognitive performance is grim. The challenge for ecological rationality and other notions of bounded rationality is to preserve the normative dimension of rationality. These notions may be really useful to describe what human agents do when they reason in certain environments, but are they also able to provide a framework for the evaluation and enhancement of human reasoning? In other words, is there room for irrationality in the picture of decision-making that Gigerenzer and his colleagues sketch?”</li>
<li>why should “cognitive luck” be avoided? what if it is true, or at least more true than avoiding it?</li>

<li>feyerabend
<ul>
<li>“Paul Feyerabend is one of the most influential authors to argue that anti-rationalism about science constitutes a challenge for the hegemony of science in contemporary society. In a collection of lectures recently made available under the title of The Tyranny of Science (2011), Feyerabend argues for the importance of promoting a variety of human endeavours and interests (i.e., religion, the arts, philosophy and science) and of embracing conflict among them as opposed to attempting to achieve perfect harmony. Conflict is, according to Feyerabend, the key to scientific progress. In a classic work, entitled Against Method, originally published in the 1970s, Feyerabend endorses the proliferation of different methodologies. His slogan is: ‘Anything goes’. Great discoveries are not made by following rigid methodological prescriptions, but are precipitated by random events.”</li>
<li>“[T]he idea of a fixed method, or of a fixed theory of rationality, rests on too naive a view of man and his social surroundings. To those who look at the rich material provided by history, and who are not intent on impoverishing it in order to please their lower instincts, their craving for intellectual security in the form of clarity, precision, ‘objectivity’, ‘truth’, it will become clear that there is only one principle that can be defended under all circumstances and in all stages of human development. It is the principle: anything goes. (Feyerabend 1975: 18–19)</li>
<li>Through the recognition of different ways of thinking, Feyerabend celebrates the openness of mind necessary for embracing new ideas. Successful scientific theories are not based on facts, but on interpretations of facts, and divergences of opinion survive in scientific communities, stimulating further research and resulting in the formation of novel hypotheses to explain long-standing problems. Although other philosophers and sociologists of science have argued against the apparent objectivity of science, and against the alleged superiority of the scientific way of thinking, what makes Feyerabend's work significant in a discourse on the meaning and scope of human rationality is that he was genuinely interested in challenging the identification of the irrational with the unscientific.”</li>

<li>“Self-narratives can fail to tell true stories about the self, but what is interesting about them is that they have the power to influence or determine an agent’s present and future behaviour. That is why a very effective way for an agent to change behaviour and abandon maladaptive ways of thinking or bad habits is to edit her personal narrative. What Tim Wilson (2013) calls story editing is ‘a set of techniques to redirect people’s narratives about themselves and the social world in a way that leads to lasting changes in behavior’ (p. 155).”</li>

<ul>
<li>Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural computation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which generate dendritic action potentials (DAP) and profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and suprathreshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicting hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</li>

However, what happens to the group consensus if it depends on several statements, one of which is proven false? Here, we show how the existence of logical constraints on beliefs affect the collective convergence to a shared belief system and, in contrast, how an idiosyncratic set of arbitrarily linked beliefs held by a few may become held by many.</li>

<ul>
<li>Physical models typically assume time-independent interactions, whereas neural networks and machine learning incorporate interactions that function as adjustable parameters. Here we demonstrate a new type of abundant cooperative nonlinear dynamics where learning is attributed solely to the nodes, instead of the network links which their number is significantly larger. The nodal, neuronal, fast adaptation follows its relative anisotropic (dendritic) input timings, as indicated experimentally, similarly to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the links, synapses. It represents a non-local learning rule, where effectively many incoming links to a node concurrently undergo the same adaptation. The network dynamics is now counterintuitively governed by the weak links, which previously were assumed to be insignificant. This cooperative nonlinear dynamic adaptation presents a self-controlled mechanism to prevent divergence or vanishing of the learning parameters, as opposed to learning by links, and also supports self-oscillations of the effective learning parameters. It hints on a hierarchical computational complexity of nodes, following their number of anisotropic inputs and opens new horizons for advanced deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications, as well as a new mechanism for enhanced and fast learning by neural networks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intrusive memories, images, and hallucinations are hallmark symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Although often attributed to deficient inhibitory control by the prefrontal cortex, difficulty in controlling intrusive thoughts is also associated with hippocampal hyperactivity, arising from dysfunctional GABAergic interneurons. How hippocampal GABA contributes to stopping unwanted thoughts is unknown. Here we show that GABAergic inhibition of hippocampal retrieval activity forms a key link in a fronto-hippocampal inhibitory control pathway underlying thought suppression. Subjects viewed reminders of unwanted thoughts and tried to suppress retrieval while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Suppression reduced hippocampal activity and memory for suppressed content. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that greater resting concentrations of hippocampal GABA predicted better mnemonic control. Higher hippocampal, but not prefrontal GABA, predicted stronger fronto-hippocampal coupling during suppression, suggesting that interneurons local to the hippocampus implement control over intrusive thoughts. Stopping actions did not engage this pathway. These findings specify a multi-level mechanistic model of how the content of awareness is voluntarily controlled.</li>

<p>The older, illiterate peasants organized the items based on whether they could be useful in a common context: they lumped wood together with hand tools, because hand tools, they said, need wood to be useful. (One informant mentioned that many useful tools could be made from wood, such as door handles.) They lumped a sparrow together with a gun and a dagger, because without the sparrow, you have nothing to hunt or divide. On the other hand, younger, educated subject easily classified objects on the basis of abstract categories (tools, made of glass, weapons, etc.).</p>
<p>The younger people were more willing to organize the world based on abstract categories—”as if” these categories existed. Older people were engaging in “as if” reasoning of a kind (“as if” each skein of yarn was a thing in the world, “as if” one were attempting to use several things at once). But, crucially, the older, illiterate people did not base their answers on “as if” realities on the symbolic, logical, analytic constructs that the younger people took (and most WEIRD people take) as utterly obvious.</p>

<li>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) provides real-time histologic imaging of human tissues at a depth of 60–70 μm during endoscopy. pCLE of the extrahepatic bile duct after fluorescein injection demonstrated a reticular pattern within fluorescein-filled sinuses that had no known anatomical correlate. Freezing biopsy tissue before fixation preserved the anatomy of this structure, demonstrating that it is part of the submucosa and a previously unappreciated fluid-filled interstitial space, draining to lymph nodes and supported by a complex network of thick collagen bundles. These bundles are intermittently lined on one side by fibroblast-like cells that stain with endothelial markers and vimentin, although there is a highly unusual and extensive unlined interface between the matrix proteins of the bundles and the surrounding fluid. We observed similar structures in numerous tissues that are subject to intermittent or rhythmic compression, including the submucosae of the entire gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder, the dermis, the peri-bronchial and peri-arterial soft tissues, and fascia. These anatomic structures may be important in cancer metastasis, edema, fibrosis, and mechanical functioning of many or all tissues and organs. In sum, we describe the anatomy and histology of a previously unrecognized, though widespread, macroscopic, fluid-filled space within and between tissues, a novel expansion and specification of the concept of the human interstitium.</li>

<li>Neurons are the computational elements that compose the brain and their fundamental principles of activity are known for decades. According to the long-lasting computational scheme, each neuron sums the incoming electrical signals via its dendrites and when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold the neuron typically generates a spike to its axon. Here we present three types of experiments, using neuronal cultures, indicating that each neuron functions as a collection of independent threshold units. The neuron is anisotropically activated following the origin of the arriving signals to the membrane, via its dendritic trees. The first type of experiments demonstrates that a single neuron’s spike waveform typically varies as a function of the stimulation location. The second type reveals that spatial summation is absent for extracellular stimulations from different directions. The third type indicates that spatial summation and subtraction are not achieved when combining intra- and extra- cellular stimulations, as well as for nonlocal time interference, where the precise timings of the stimulations are irrelevant. Results call to re-examine neuronal functionalities beyond the traditional framework, and the advanced computational capabilities and dynamical properties of such complex systems.</li>

<ul>
<li>Systems-level organization in spontaneous infra-slow (&lt;0.1Hz) brain activity, measured using blood oxygen signals in fMRI and optical imaging, has become a major theme in the study of neural function in both humans and animal models. Yet the neurophysiological basis of infra-slow activity (ISA) remains unresolved. In particular, is ISA a distinct physiological process, or is it a low-frequency analog of faster neural activity? Here, using whole-cortex calcium/hemoglobin imaging in mice, we show that ISA in each of these modalities travels through the cortex along stereotypical spatiotemporal trajectories that are state dependent (wake versus anesthesia) and distinct from trajectories in delta (1–4 Hz) activity. Moreover, mouse laminar electrophysiology reveals that ISA travels through specific cortical layers and is organized into unique cross-laminar temporal dynamics that are different from higher frequency local field potential activity. These findings suggest that ISA is a distinct neurophysiological process that is reflected in fMRI blood oxygen signals.</li>

Ciliary GPCR signaling is critical for emergence of interneuronal connectivity<br />
Cilia signaling is a non-synaptic mechanism to sculpt interneuronal circuits<br />
Disrupted cilia signaling may underlie circuit malformations in ciliopathies</p>
<p>Appropriate growth and synaptic integration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are essential for functional neural circuits in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of primary cilia function following the selective loss of ciliary GTPase Arl13b in interneurons impairs interneuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity, leading to altered excitatory/inhibitory activity balance. The altered morphology and connectivity of cilia mutant interneurons and the functional deficits are rescued by either chemogenetic activation of ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling or the selective induction of Sstr3, a ciliary GPCR, in Arl13b-deficient cilia. Our results thus define a specific requirement for primary cilia-mediated GPCR signaling in interneuronal connectivity and inhibitory circuit formation.</p>
