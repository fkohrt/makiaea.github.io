<p><em>political extremism is supported by an illusion of understanding</em><br />

<ul>
<li>“generating mechanistic explanations leads people to endorse more moderate positions by forcing them to confront their ignorance. In contrast, reasons can draw on values, hearsay, and general principles that do not require much knowledge.”</li>
<li>“suggest a corrective for several psychological phenomena that make polarization self-reinforcing. People often are unaware of their own ignorance (Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999), seek out information that supports their current preferences (Nickerson, 1998), process new information in biased ways that strengthen their current preferences (Lord, Ross, &amp; Lepper, 1979), affiliate with other people who have similar preferences (Lazarsfeld &amp; Merton, 1954), and assume that other people’s views are as extreme as their own (Van Boven, Judd, &amp; Sherman, 2012). In sum, several psychological factors increase extremism, and attitude polarization is therefore hard to avoid. Explanation generation will by no means eliminate extremism, but our data suggest that it offers a means of counteracting a tendency supported by multiple psychological factors. In that sense, it promises to be an effective debiasing procedure.”</li>

<p><em>benefiting from disagreement: counterarguing reduces prechoice bias in information evaluation authors</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Confirmatory information processing (i.e., information distortion) is a robust phenomenon with no known mitigation. This research proposes that information distortion might be mitigated by disrupting its driver, namely, the need for cognitive consistency. Priming a counter-arguing mindset should induce people to refute their emerging preferences, thereby disrupting the operation of cognitive consistency. Five studies confirm this prediction. Study 1 demonstrates that priming a counter-arguing mindset decreases information distortion. Studies 2 and 3 replicate Study 1 and further show that the influence of a head start on choice diminishes when counter-arguing is primed. Study 4 shows that priming counter-arguing inhibits consistency-related concepts. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that counter-arguing not only reduces distortion but also yields reduced commitment to the preferred alternative.</li>

<p><em>the political economy of ideas: on ideas versus interests in policymaking</em><br />
sharun mukand, dani rodrik 2018<br />
<a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/the_political_economy_of_ideas.pdf">https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/the_political_economy_of_ideas.pdf</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We develop a conceptual framework to highlight the role of ideas as a catalyst for policy and institutional change. We make an explicit distinction between ideas and vested interests and show how they feed into each other. In doing so the paper integrates the Keynes-Hayek perspective on the importance of ideas with the currently more fashionable Stigler-Becker (in-terests only) approach to political economy. We distinguish between two kinds of ideational politics – the battle among different worldviews on the efficacy of policy (worldview politics) versus the politics of victimhood, pride and identity (identity politics). Political entrepreneurs discover identity and policy ‘memes’ (narratives, cues, framing) that shift beliefs about how the world works or a person’s belief of who he is (i.e. identity). Our framework identifies a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrates how they may reinforce each other. In particular, an increase in identity polarization may be associated with a shift in views about how the world works. Furthermore, an increase in income inequality is likely to result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. Finally, we show how ideas may not just constrain, but also ‘bite’ the interests that helped propagate them in the first instance.</li>

<p><em>perceived conflict and leader dominance: individual and contextual factors behind preferences for dominant leaders</em><br />
lasse laustsen, michael bang petersen 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pops.12403">dx.doi.org/10.1111/pops.12403</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent research finds that political candidates and leaders with dominant, masculine physical features are more preferred under conditions of conflict than of cooperation. Importantly, however, methodological limitations of past research have hindered the identification of whether this effect reflects that voters intuitively view (1) dominant leaders as more competent in solving problems of conflict, (2) nondominant leaders as more competent in solving problems of cooperation, or (3) both. In this article, we utilize recent advances in evolutionary psychology to form precise predictions on the nature of the underlying psychology and employ an unprecedented array of data types—including highly controlled experiments, natural experiments, and behavioral measures—to investigate the validity of these predictions. Using large approximately nationally representative surveys of 2,009 Poles and Ukrainians fielded during the Crimea crisis in 2014, we find that preferences for leader dominance are exclusively driven by the intuition that dominant leaders are better able to facilitate aggressive responses during social conflict and that these preferences are regulated by contextual conditions and individual predispositions related to such responses.</li>

<p><em>ideas rise from chaos: information structure and creativity</em><br />
yeun joon kim, chen-bo zhong 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2016.10.001">dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2016.10.001</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Is structure good or bad for creativity? When it comes to organizing information, management scholars have long advocated for a hierarchical information structure (information organized around higher-order categories as opposed to a flat information structure where there is no higher-order category) to reduce complexity of information processing and increase efficiency of work. However, a hierarchical informa-tion structure can be a double-edged sword that may reduce creativity, defined as novel and useful combination of existing information. This is because a hierarchical information structure might obstruct combining information from distal conceptual categories. Thus, the current research investigates whether information structure influences creativity. We theorize that a hierarchical information struc-ture, compared to a flat information structure, will reduce creativity because it reduces cognitive flexibil-ity. Three experiments using a sentence construction task and a LEGO task supported our prediction.</li>

<p><em>how to use bureaucracies</em><br />

<ul>
<li>“When we encounter unsavory features of reality, it can be tempting to look away. Instead, we should ask, “What purpose does this serve?”<br />
With this in mind, let’s look at bureaucracies. Some people fear bureaucracies; they fear “the Machine.” Others are bothered by the bureaucracies ’ apparent dysfunction. With a better understanding of bureaucracies — what they are, why they’re here, and how they work — both of these responses evaporate, because the reality is this: bureaucracies aren’t altogether bad. In fact, bureaucracies can be incredibly useful.”</li>

<ul>
<li>women were trained to long and hunger for relationships and connection, a conditioning that made them vulnerable to exploitation of their attachment, which is exactly what gaslighting is.</li>
<li>Gaslighting in interpersonal relationships often develops or builds on an existing power dynamic. While it’s most common in romantic settings, gaslighting can happen in any kind of relationship where one person is so important to the other that they don’t want to take the chance of upsetting or losing them, such as a boss, friend, sibling, or parent. Gaslighting happens in relationships where there is an unequal power dynamic and the target has given the gaslighter power and often their respect.</li>

<p><em>originals: how non–conformists move the world</em><br />

<p>“Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing theirs. It’s hard to change other people’s ideals. It’s much easier to link our agendas to familiar values that people already hold.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at bridgewater, “In the language of futurist Paul Saffo, the norm is to have “strong opinions, weakly held.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By devoting more than an hour to the debate on that matter, employees reached consensus that they needed to push one another to share original ideas. That transparency would shield them against groupthink, enabling them to avoid countless bad decisions over time. By building a culture in which people are constantly encouraging one another to disagree, Dalio has created a powerful way to combat conformity. Yet the kind of disagreement he seeks is the opposite of what most leaders invite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hofmann found that a culture that focuses too heavily on solutions becomes a culture of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you’re always expected to have an answer ready, you’ll arrive at meetings with your diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to learn from a broad range of perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ray Dalio doesn’t want employees to bring him solutions; he expects them to bring him problems. One of his first inventions was the issue log, an open-access database for employees to flag any problem they identify and to rate its severity. Getting problems noted is half the battle against groupthink; the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. The Bridgewater procedure for the latter is to gather a group of credible people to diagnose the problems, share their reasoning, and explore the causes and possible solutions.</p>
<p>Although everyone’s opinions are welcome, they’re not all valued equally. Bridgewater is not a democracy. Voting privileges the majority, when the minority might have a better opinion. “Democratic decision making—one person, one vote—is dumb,” Dalio explains, “because not everybody has the same believability.”*</p>
<p>At Bridgewater, every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. In sports, statistics for every player’s performance history are public. In baseball, before you sign a player, you can look up his batting average, home runs, and steals; assess his strengths and weaknesses; and adjust accordingly. Dalio wanted Bridgewater to work the same way, so he created baseball cards that display statistics on every employee’s performance, which can be accessed by anyone at the company. If you’re about to interact with a few Bridgewater colleagues for the first time, you can see their track records on seventy-seven different dimensions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, and organization and reliability.</p>
<p>During regular review cycles, employees rate one another on different qualities like integrity, courage, living in truth, taking the bull by its horns, not tolerating problems, being willing to touch a nerve, fighting to get in sync, and holding people accountable. Between cycles, employees can give real-time, open feedback to anyone in the company. At any time, employees can submit dots, or observations—they assess peers, leaders, or subordinates on the metrics and give short explanations of what they’ve observed. The baseball cards create a “pointillist picture” of staff members, aggregating across review cycles and dots, and incorporate various assessments that employees take. The cards’ display changes over time, revealing who’s best suited to play each position, and flagging areas to “rely on” and “watch out for” with green and red lights.</p>
<p>When you express an opinion, it’s weighted by whether you’ve established yourself as believable on that dimension. Your believability is a probability of being right in the present, and is based on your judgment, reasoning, and behavior in the past. In presenting your views, you’re expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts, and you’re not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn’t have an opinion in the first place; you’re supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you’re expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright about it—but know that your colleagues will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you’re supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time. As management scholar Karl Weick advises, “Argue like you’re right and listen like you’re wrong.”-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens, though, when believable people don’t agree? In the summer of 2014, Bridgewater conducted an anonymous survey to find out about dissent that hadn’t been voiced. When co-CEO Greg Jensen led an all-hands meeting to discuss the results, an employee, “Ashley,” commented that some people were misinterpreting Bridgewater’s principles. Greg asked if she was correcting them when that occurred, and Ashley mentioned that she had recently called someone out for a misinterpretation.</p>
<p>By speaking up, Ashley was exemplifying one of Bridgewater’s principles. But rather than responding to the substance of her comment, Greg called her out for violating another Bridgewater principle, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between the forest and the trees, and navigating between the two. He wanted a synthesis of how she handled such situations in general, not her account of a specific case.</p>
<p>A senior manager, Trina Soske, felt that Greg made a bad leadership decision. Although he was attempting to adhere to one Bridgewater principle, Trina was concerned that Ashley—and others—might be discouraged from speaking up in the future. In most organizations, since Greg had higher status than her, a manager in Trina’s position would remain silent and go home thinking he was a jerk. But Trina wrote honest feedback for the whole company to read. She praised Ashley for having the courage and integrity to speak up, and cautioned Greg that his response “signaled the exact opposite of what you, as a CEO, should model.”</p>
<p>In a typical organization, as the senior leader Greg’s opinion would prevail over Trina’s, and her career might be in jeopardy for criticizing him. But at Bridgewater, Trina wasn’t punished, and the resolution wasn’t based on authority, seniority, majority, or who spoke the most loudly or forcefully. It started with a debate via email: Greg disagreed with Trina’s views, as he felt he was being open and direct; after all, principle three stated that no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up. But Trina had heard two different people criticize Greg’s behavior in informal conversations. “The dampening impact is going to be more about what you don’t see and don’t hear,” she wrote to him. She worried that Greg’s behavior would instigate groupthink, causing people to stay silent rather than to challenge leaders. Greg stood his ground: By allowing people to talk behind his back, Trina was failing to hold people accountable for confronting him with their critical opinions. She was allowing them to violate one of Bridgewater’s principles by acting like “slimy weasels.”</p>
<p>It’s extremely rare to see a senior leader open to this kind of thoughtful disagreement, but even more unusual was what Greg did next. “I doubt we’ll be able to resolve this ourselves,” he wrote to Trina, copying the entire management committee—a group of people who had established their believability as leaders. “It’s like agreeing on a judge or a mediator,” Dalio explains. By escalating the disagreement to them, Greg was allowing the idea meritocracy to sort out who was right.</p>
<p>Instead of leaving it to the management committee to resolve, though, Dalio asked Greg and Trina to collaborate on turning their conflict into a case to share with all of Bridgewater. Along with making their debate transtransparent, it forced them to inquire about each other’s perspectives instead of just advocating for their own viewpoints. When the case was finished, to continue the inquiry process Greg and Trina each generated questions to ask the entire company.</p>
<p>Several months after the issue first occurred, it was still being discussed, and the analytics team was preparing to share the data on employees’ reactions. But “resolving the issue itself is in some ways less important than understanding the path to resolving such things in the future, and agreeing on that,” Zack Wieder explains. “No one (including our CEO) has any monopoly on the truth.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not just Dalio’s openness that makes people comfortable challenging senior leaders. It’s the fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced, Bridgewater reveals that we can start encouraging originality on day one. In most organizations, the socialization period is passive: We’re busy learning the ropes and familiarizing ourselves with the culture. By the time we’re up to speed, we’re already swamped with work and beginning to see the world in the company way. The early period is the perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A principle is just some type of event happening over and over again, and how to deal with that event. Life consists of billions of these events, and if you can go from those billions to 250, you can make the connection, ‘Ah, this is one of those ’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he explained that he favored the debate format between believable people, because it was the fastest way to reach the right answer and it enabled them to learn from each other’s reasoning. He had been testing out different cultural practices at Bridgewater for years, and although they’re not controlled experiments, he felt he’d seen enough to have a good sense of what works. He believes that thoughtful disagreement between experts creates an efficient marketplace of ideas, where the best ones emerge over time.</p>
<p>this is my feeling in a nutshell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>driven and imaginative, but I was intrigued by three other qualities on Dalio’s list. “Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear of failing.</p>
<p>Dalio himself fits this description, and the hurdle facing him now is to find another shaper to fill his shoes. If he doesn’t, Bridgewater may vanish like Polaroid’s instant pictures. But Dalio knows that preventing groupthink is about more than the vision of a single leader. The greatest shapers don’t stop at introducing originality into the world. They create cultures that unleash originality in others.</p>

<p><em>an illustration of why we have and must use diverse capabilities at different times</em></p>
<p>When we’re not yet committed to a particular action, thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous. Since we don’t have our hearts set on charging ahead, envisioning a dismal failure will only activate anxiety, triggering the stop system and slamming our brakes. By looking on the bright side, we’ll activate enthusiasm and turn on the go system.</p>
<p>But once we’ve settled on a course of action, when anxieties creep in, it’s better to think like a defensive pessimist and confront them directly. In this case instead of attempting to turn worries and doubts into positive emotions, we can shift the go system into higher gear by embracing our fear. Since we’ve set our minds to press forward, envisioning the worst-case scenario enables us to harness anxiety as a source of motivation to prepare and succeed. Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more terrifying than the negative. As Julie Norem describes it, once people have imagined the worst, “they feel more in control. In some sense, they’ve peaked in anxiety before their actual performance. By the time they get to the event itself they’ve taken care of almost everything.”</p>

<p><em>fighting pluralistic ignorance</em></p>
<p>When Popovic trained the Egyptian activists, he shared a story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike, they issued a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon, pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars and trucks at a glacial pace. In his inspiring book Blueprint for Revolution, Popovic explains that prior to these activities:</p>
<p>People were afraid to talk openly about despising Pinochet, so if you hated the dictator, you might have imagined that you were the only one. Tactics like these, Chileans used to say, made people realize that “we are the many and they are the few.” And the beauty was that there was no risk involved: Not even in North Korea was it illegal for cars to drive slowly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Popovic sees a role for amusement wherever fear runs rampant. Instead of trying to decelerate the stop system, he uses laughter to rev up the go system. When you have no power, it’s a powerful way to convert strong negative emotions into positive ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want people to modify their behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing? According to Peter Salovey, one of the originators of the concept of emotional intelligence and now the president of Yale, it depends on whether they perceive the new behavior as safe or risky. If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it—they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. They’re already comfortable with the status quo, so the benefits of change aren’t attractive, and the stop system kicks in. Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and accentuate the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. The prospect of a certain loss brings the go system online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>this is the beauty of the plague inc “destroy” model</em></p>
<p>This “kill the company” exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain-framed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating about innovation opportunities, the leaders weren’t inclined to take risks. When they considered how their competitors could put them out of business, they realized that it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation was apparent.</p>
<p>To counter apathy, most change agents focus on presenting an inspiring vision of the future. This is an important message to convey, but it’s not the type of communication that should come first. If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with the present. To drive people out of their comfort zones, you have to cultivate dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger at the current state of affairs, making it a guaranteed loss. “The greatest communicators of all time,” says communication expert Nancy Duarte—who has spent her career studying the shape of superb presentations—start by establishing “what is: here’s the status quo.” Then, they “compare that to what could be,” making “that gap as big as possible.”</p>

<p><em>recollections of childhood bullying and multiple forms of victimization: correlates with psychological functioning among college students</em><br />

<ul>
<li>This retrospective investigation examined the association among childhood bullying victimization, multiple forms of victimization, and psychological functioning in a college sample. Four hundred-and-eighty-two undergraduate students participated in the study (M = 19.98 years, SD = 1.82). The sample included 65 % women. For race/ethnicity, 66.4 % were European-American (N = 320), 16.8 % African-American (N = 81). For grade level, 21.6 % were freshmen (N = 104), followed by 38.2 % sophomores (N = 184), 16.2 % juniors (N = 78), and 23.4 % seniors (N = 113). Participants completed a survey packet of measures assessing childhood bullying victimization experiences and current levels of psychological functioning. Findings indicated that bullying victimization significantly predicted greater levels of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS) after controlling for other childhood victimization experiences. PTS symptoms were predicted by exposure to community violence and child abuse with bullying victimization was found to be the strongest predictor. College-level practitioners need to assess for a wide range of childhood victimization experiences, including bullying victimization.</li>

<ul>
<li>In order to address the influence of unethical leader behaviors in the form of abusive supervision on subordinates’ retaliatory responses, we meta-analytically examined the impact of abusive supervision on subordinate deviance, inclusive of the role of justice and power distance. Specifically, we investigated the mediating role of supervisory- and organizationally focused justice and the moderating role of power distance as one model explaining why and when abusive supervision is related to subordinate deviance toward supervisors and organizations. With 79 independent sample studies (<em>N</em> = 22,021), we found that abusive supervision was more strongly related to supervisory-focused justice, compared to organizationally focused justice perceptions, and both types of justice perceptions were related to target-similar deviance (deviance toward the supervisor and organization, respectively). Finally, our results showed that the negative implications of abusive supervision were stronger in lower power distance cultures compared to higher power distance cultures.</li>

<p><em>phenomenological configurations of workplace bullying: a cluster approach</em><br />
marinella paciello et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.001</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New research reveals how frequently being the target of workplace bullying not only leads to health-related problems but can also cause victims to behave badly themselves.</p>
<p>The study, led by the University of East Anglia (UEA) in collaboration with Uninettuno Telematic International University in Italy, found that in some cases this is characterised by a lack of problem solving and high avoidance coping strategies. For example, drinking alcohol when having a problem, experiencing very frequent negative emotions, such as anger, fear and sadness, and high work 'moral disengagement', which refers to the way individuals rationalise their actions and absolve themselves of responsibility for the consequences.</p>
<p>Bullying is one of the major occupational stresses for employees and the effects can compromise their development and health, as well as interfere with the achievement of both personal and professional goals.</p>
<p>It is usually differentiated as work-related and personal-related bullying. The former refers to bullying affecting workload -- for example removing responsibility -- and work processes, such as attacks on someone's professional status. The latter refers to both indirect -- for example exclusion and isolation -- and direct negative behaviour, such as physical abuse.</p>
<p>While previous research has shown a link between being the target of bullying and behavioral problems, for the first time this study identified different configurations of victims by considering not only exposure to and types of bullying, but also health problems and bad behaviour.</p>
<p>The study also examined how these groups differ in terms of negative emotions experienced in relation to work, coping strategies, and moral disengagement.</p>
<p>Published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, the study was led by Dr Roberta Fida, a senior lecturer in work psychology at UEA's Norwich Business School. She said: &quot;Overall, our results show the need to consider not only exposure to and types of bullying but also their associated consequences. In particular, the findings highlight that victimisation is associated not only with health problems but also with a greater likelihood of not behaving in line with the expected social and organisational norms.</p>
<p>&quot;The greater the intensity of bullying and the more the exposure to different types of bullying, the higher the likelihood of engaging in counterproductive workplace behaviour. Furthermore, the results show that health-related symptoms are not always associated with experiences of bullying. Indeed, while those experiencing limited work-related bullying did not report health problems, those who were not bullied but misbehaved did.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors say the importance of emotions needs to be considered in HR and management intervention policies. &quot;Despite the evidence recognising the relevance of emotions when dealing with workplace aggression, this is rarely incorporated into guidelines,&quot; said Dr Fida. &quot;In addition, it is essential to also promote behavioural regulation strategies to reduce moral disengagement, as well as negative compensating behaviour, such as drinking more alcohol and taking more risks. Its role in allowing 'otherwise good' people to freely engage in conduct they would generally consider wrong is further confirmed in this study.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers asked 1019 Italian employees about their experiences of workplace bullying, counterproductive behaviour and health symptoms. They were also asked about their coping strategies, negative emotions experienced at work and moral disengagement.</p>
<p>Five groups were identified, one of which includes victims who are the target of work-related bullying and frequently exposed to personal-related bullying, who experience high health problems and misbehaviour (4.4% of the sample).</p>
<p>Another group experience work-related bullying but less frequent personal-related bullying, and show lower health problems and misbehaviour (9.6%). Although they generally use problem-solving strategies, they tend to be overwhelmed by the negative emotions they experience and are not able to control them. They also have a tendency to morally disengage.</p>
<p>A third group have limited exposure to work-related bullying and no exposure to personal-related bullying (22.3%). While not experiencing health-related problems they sometimes engage in counterproductive work behaviour.</p>
<p>A fourth group includes those who are not bullied, but have high health-related symptoms and some misbehaviour (23.9%). The last group identified are not exposed to any bullying, have no health symptoms or behavioral problems (39.9%).</p>
<p>Examination of the groups in relation to individual dimensions highlighted the pivotal role of negative emotions and emotional regulation, independently from exposure to workplace bullying. In more severe cases, moral disengagement and compensatory behaviour play an equally important role, suggesting the weakening of individuals' ability to regulate their behaviour.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The present study represents an innovative contribution combining an articulated description of phenomenological manifestations of bullying with an in-depth picture of individual processes operating within the regulative system. Phenomenological configurations of bullying were identified considering not only exposure to and types of bullying, but also two of its main correlates: health problems and deviant behaviour. Moreover, the study examined how these configurations differ in terms of discrete negative emotions experienced in relation to work, coping strategies, and moral disengagement. Results from a sample of 1019 employee (53.6% women) support a 5-cluster solution: not bullied with no symptoms and no misbehaviour (39.9%); not bullied but with symptoms and some misbehaviour (23.9%); targets exposed to limited work-related negative acts, with no symptoms and some misbehaviour (22.3%); targets of work-related bullying with symptoms and misbehaviour (9.6%); and victims with high symptoms and high misbehaviour (4.4%). Moreover, the examination of clusters in relation to individual dimensions highlights the pivotal role of negative emotions and emotional regulation, independently from exposure to workplace bullying. Further, in more severe cases, moral disengagement and compensatory behaviour play an equally important role suggesting the weakening of individuals' behavioural regulation.</p>

<li>The degree of human cooperation among strangers is a major evolutionary puzzle. A prominent explanation is that cooperation is maintained because many individuals have a predisposition to punish those violating group-beneficial norms. A critical condition for cooperation to evolve in evolutionary models is that punishment increases with the severity of the violation. Here we present evidence from a field experiment with real-life interactions that, unlike in lab experiments, altruistic punishment does not increase with the severity of the violation, regardless of whether it is direct (confronting a violator) or indirect (withholding help). We also document growing concerns for counter-punishment as the severity of the violation increases, indicating that the marginal cost of direct punishment increases with the severity of violations. The evidence suggests that altruistic punishment may not provide appropriate incentives to deter large violations. Our findings thus offer a rationale for the emergence of formal institutions for promoting large-scale cooperation among strangers.</li>

<li>human rights have proven to be exclusionary – even within our own species. Its emergence as a set of legal and moral norms betrays the fact that the white, European, male property-owner is the paradigm case of ‘the human’: others, historically, have had to fight even to be seen as fully capable of bearing rights. International treaties have been required to address the rights of women, children, workers, LGBT people, indigenous communities and others, precisely because such ‘minorities’ were marginalised by the abstract idea of ‘the human’ of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Critics have also suggested that human rights norms are a Trojan horse for neo-imperialism, providing ideological cover for dubious ‘humanitarian’ interventions and capitalist plundering. In theory, human rights are for all humans, but it turns out that some people are more human than others.</li>

<p><em>not my future? core values and the neural representation of future events</em><br />
tobias brosch et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>Individuals with pronounced self-transcendence values have been shown to put greater weight on the long-term consequences of their actions when making decisions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the evaluation of events occurring several decades in the future as well as the role of core values in these processes. Thirty-six participants viewed a series of events, consisting of potential consequences of climate change, which could occur in the near future (around 2030), and thus would be experienced by the participants themselves, or in the far future (around 2080). We observed increased activation in anterior VMPFC (BA11), a region involved in encoding the personal significance of future events, when participants were envisioning far future events, demonstrating for the first time that the role of the VMPFC in future projection extends to the time scale of decades. Importantly, this activation increase was observed only in participants with pronounced self-transcendence values measured by self-report questionnaire, as shown by a statistically significant interaction of temporal distance and value structure. These findings suggest that future projection mechanisms are modulated by self-transcendence values to allow for a more extensive simulation of far future events. Consistent with this, these participants reported similar concern ratings for near and far future events, whereas participants with pronounced self-enhancement values were more concerned about near future events. Our findings provide a neural substrate for the tendency of individuals with pronounced self-transcendence values to consider the long-term consequences of their actions.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>“We found that with altruistic people, this cerebral zone is activated more forcefully when the subject is confronted with the consequences of a distant future as compared to the near future. By contrast, in an egotistical person, there is no increase in activity between a consequence in the near future and one in the distant future,” says Brosch.</p>
<p>“We could imagine a psychological training that would work on this brain area using projection exercises,” suggests Brosch. “In particular, we could use virtual reality, which would make the tomorrow’s world visible to everyone, bringing human beings closer to the consequences of their actions.”</p>

<p><em>influence of vmpfc on dmpfc predicts valence-guided belief formation</em><br />

<ul>
<li>When updating beliefs about their future prospects, people tend to disregard bad news. By combining fMRI with computational and dynamic causal modeling, we identified neurocircuitry mechanisms underlying this optimism bias to test for valence-guided belief formation. In each trial of the fMRI task, participants (<em>n</em> = 24, 10 male) estimated the base rate (eBR) and their risks of experiencing negative future events, were confronted with the actual BR, and finally had the opportunity to update their initial self-related risk estimate. We demonstrated an optimism bias by revealing greater belief updates in response to good over bad news (i.e., learning that the actual BR is lower or higher than expected) while controlling for confounds (estimation error and personal relevance of the new information). Updating was favorable when the final belief about risks improved (or at least did not worsen) relative to the initial risk estimate. This valence of updating was encoded by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) associated with the valuation of rewards. Within the updating circuit, the vmPFC filtered the incoming signal in a valence-dependent manner and influenced the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Both the valence-encoding activity in the vmPFC and its influence on the dmPFC predicted individual magnitudes of the optimism bias. Our results indicate that updating was biased by the motivation to maximize desirable beliefs, mediated by the influence of the valuation system on further cognitive processing. Therefore, although it provides the very basis for human reasoning, belief formation is essentially distorted to promote desired conclusions.<br />
<strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> The question of whether human reasoning is biased by desires and goals is crucial for everyday social, professional, and economic decisions. How much our belief formation is influenced by what we want to believe is, however, still debated. Our study confirms that belief updates are indeed optimistically biased. Critically, the bias depends on the recruitment of the brain valuation system and the influence of this system on neural regions involved in reasoning. These neurocircuit interactions support the notion that the motivation to maximize pleasant beliefs reinforces those cognitive processes that are most likely to yield the desired conclusion.</li>

<p>“You can imagine within an organization today the attitude, ‘Hey, you’re working too hard and making the rest of us look bad.’ In some organizations people are known for policing how hard others work, to make sure no one is raising the bar from what is expected.”</p>
<p>The same social dynamic may affect actions to protect the environment, which requires acting both individually and cooperatively for the good of all, Barclay added.</p>
<p>People who do nothing for the environment risk damaging their reputation, and may instead choose to attack the motives of environmentalists, he said.</p>
<p>“It is a way of bringing those people back down, and stopping them from looking better than oneself in their attempts to protect the environment or address social inequality,” Barclay said.</p>
<p>“One potential benefit of this research is that by identifying and raising awareness of this competitive social strategy and what it does, maybe it will be less likely to work.”</p>

<li>Many negatively connoted personality traits (often termed “dark traits”) have been introduced to account for ethically, morally, and socially questionable behavior. Herein, we provide a unifying, comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding dark personality in terms of a general dispositional tendency of which dark traits arise as specific manifestations. That is, we theoretically specify the common core of dark traits, which we call the Dark Factor of Personality (D). The fluid concept of D captures individual differences in the tendency to maximize one’s individual utility—disregarding, accepting, or malevolently provoking disutility for others—, accompanied by beliefs that serve as justifications. To critically test D, we unify and extend prior work methodologically and empirically by considering a large number of dark traits simultaneously, using statistical approaches tailored to capture both the common core and the unique content of dark traits, and testing the predictive validity of both D and the unique content of dark traits with respect to diverse criteria including fully consequential and incentive-compatible behavior. In a series of four studies (N &gt; 2,500), we provide evidence in support of the theoretical conceptualization of D, show that dark traits can be understood as specific manifestations of D, demonstrate that D predicts a multitude of criteria in the realm of ethically, morally, and socially questionable behavior, and illustrate that D does not depend on any particular indicator variable included.</li>

<li>Manipulation of host behaviour by parasitoids has long captured the imagination of ecologists. Parasitoid wasps in the Polysphincta group of genera develop as external parasitoids of spiders.</li>
<li>In the present study, the previously undescribed interaction between a Zatypota sp. wasp (Ichneumonidae) and a social spider Anelosimus eximius (Theridiidae) is described. The larva of this Zatypota wasp is found to induce its host to disperse from their communal web and build an entirely enclosed web consisting of densely spun silk.</li>
<li>The wasp is observed to target primarily immature A. eximius individuals, with 37.5–44% of nests in a given area being parasitised. Of those nests, approximately 1.3–2.0% of individuals are hosts to the parasitoid larvae. Larger spider colonies had a significantly higher probability of harbouring parasitoids.</li>
<li>This interaction results in unusual behaviours for A. eximius induced by the parasitoid: (i) leaving the protection of the social nest and (ii) building a unique, altered web that it would not otherwise build.<br />
It is suggested that the wasp may be tapping into ancestral dispersal behaviours in its host and that a social species provides this wasp an evolutionary advantage by allowing a stable host source.</li>

<p><em>parental alienating behaviors: an unacknowledged form of family violence</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Despite affecting millions of families around the world, parental alienation has been largely unacknowledged or denied by legal and health professionals as a form of family violence. This complex form of aggression entails a parental figure engaging in the long-term use of a variety of aggressive behaviors to harm the relationship between their child and another parental figure, and/or to hurt the other parental figure directly because of their relationship with their child. Like other forms of family violence, parental alienation has serious and negative consequences for family members, yet victims are often blamed for their experience. In order to be recognized as a form of family violence and to secure protection for victims under law and social policies, a formal review and comparison of parental alienating behaviors and outcomes to child abuse and intimate partner violence has been sorely needed. The result of this review highlights how the societal denial of parental alienation has been like the historical social and political denial or other forms of abuse in many parts of the world (e.g., child abuse a century ago). Reframing parental alienating behaviors as a form of family violence also serves as a desperate call to action for social scientists to focus more theoretical and empirical attention to this topic.</li>

<p><em>multisensory logic of infant-directed aggression by males</em><br />

<p>The Higgins Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Lee and Ezpeleta Professor of Arts and Sciences, Dulac is the lead author of a new study that suggests infanticide in mice is triggered by a suite of factors, including the shape of the pup and a specific set of olfactory signals, or pheromones. The study is described in a December 13 paper published in Cell.</p>
<p>In addition to Dulac, the study is co-authored by Yoh Isogai, a former post-doctoral fellow in Dulac's lab who has now launched his own laboratory at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in London, UK.</p>
<p>&quot;For parents, the cry of a baby is an incredibly powerful stimulus to stop everything they are doing at the moment and care for their infant,&quot; Dulac said. &quot;But the fact is that, for some animals, the signal associated with an infant drives this extreme form of aggression. The question we wanted to answer was: What is it that drives infanticide versus parental behavior? And what we found is a complex but fascinating set of features.&quot;</p>
<p>Male infanticide was in fact first described in the late 1970s by a Harvard graduate student in the Psychology Department, Sarah Hrdy, who realized that male langurs, a species of primates she was studying in India, often attacked and killed infants from other males.</p>
<p>Hrdy interpreted this aggressive behavior as an instinctive drive to get rid of the progeny of rivals and sire their own offspring. Indeed, although Hrdy's initial description of this shocking behavior in langurs caused some controversy, her observation was quickly expanded to a variety of primates, lions, rodents, and about half of mammalian species, but not humans nor generally monogamous species, in which animals of both sexes participate in the nurturing of infants.</p>
<p>In an effort to understand the triggers for that aggressive behavior, Dulac and colleagues began by targeting the vomeronasal organ, or VNO, a part of the olfactory system used primarily by many mammals to detect pheromones. Earlier studies had shown that blocking VNO signals in mice stopped infanticide, and that animals without a VNO don't engage in the behavior, and instead perform a wide variety of parenting behaviors.</p>
<p>&quot;That suggested that there are two types of signals,&quot; Dulac said. &quot;The ones that drive parenting, which do not require pheromones, and those that drive infanticide, which do.&quot;</p>
<p>In the process of trying to identify what those infanticidal signals might be, Dulac and colleagues found that male mice would attack even dead pups -- suggesting that movement or even temperature weren't key factors in their aggression.</p>
<p>What did turn out to be significant, Dulac said, was shape.</p>
<p>&quot;We made silicone casts of pups and then put chemicals on them to test whether males would attack it,&quot; she said. &quot;The first was a perfect cast of a pup, and if we put salivary gland extract of a pup on it, males would attack.&quot;</p>
<p>In subsequent test, involving a plain brick of silicone and a blob shape that somewhat resembled a pup, there were no attacks. Interestingly, however, when researchers attached legs and a tail to the brick shape, male did attack the dummy.</p>
<p>Armed with that information, Dulac and colleagues set to work pinpointing the chemical cues that set off the attacks by first identifying seven pheromone receptors which are expressed by the VNO.</p>
<p>&quot;What we found was that, actually, none of them are specific to pups,&quot; Dulac said. &quot;That is both surprising and not surprising. It's surprising because we know that receptors for pheromones are typically extraordinarily specific.</p>
<p>&quot;But it's not surprising because when we thought about it, if there were receptors specific to pups, it would mean there are chemicals that specifically identify pups, for them to be killed&quot; she continued. &quot;Evolutionarily speaking, why would a pup emit a chemical that tells a male, 'I'm a pup, you need to attack me?' The pups actually want to get rid of those cues and become a blank canvas, chemically-speaking.&quot;</p>
<p>What Dulac and colleagues found was that, rather than detect chemical cues that are specific to pups, attacking males are actually responding to a mix of shared maternal and infant cues.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens is Mom licks the pup and they share a lot of chemical signals,&quot; Dulac said. &quot;We identified two in particular -- one of them is a specific salivary protein. But the other is hemoglobin. There is bleeding that occurs during birth, and it turns out that this signal stays around for several weeks, betraying the presence of newborn infants.&quot;</p>
<p>The hemoglobin signal might be particularly important, Dulac added, because when pups bleed during an attack, the signal will get stronger, amplifying the aggression of the male.</p>
<p>On their own, Dulac said, those signals -- both the shape information and the chemical signals -- don't provoke attacks, but taken together, those allow males to form a full picture of their surroundings and identify pups.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she said, the study not only provides a detailed picture of the underpinnings of a controversial natural behavior, but also highlights the complex, push-and-pull relationship between pups and potentially aggressive males.</p>
<p>&quot;The pup has two needs -- it needs to be recognized to be nurtured and it needs to not be recognized so it won't be attacked,&quot; Dulac said. &quot;So there are these conflicting needs...the way the system has evolved, it's probably a tug of war where, chemically, the pup is trying to be a blank slate, but males detect chemicals associated with maternity and the physical traits of the pups.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •Reconstituted pup shape and chemosignals trigger aggression by virgin males<br />
•Repertoire of seven VNO receptors activated by pups is also stimulated by adult cues<br />
•Deletion of receptors to salivary protein and hemoglobin shows role in pup attack<br />
•Complex recognition involves pup’s shape and chemosignals from infants and parents</p>
<p>Newborn mice emit signals that promote parenting from mothers and fathers but trigger aggressive responses from virgin males. Although pup-directed attacks by males require vomeronasal function, the specific infant cues that elicit this behavior are unknown. We developed a behavioral paradigm based on reconstituted pup cues and showed that discrete infant morphological features combined with salivary chemosignals elicit robust male aggression. Seven vomeronasal receptors were identified based on infant-mediated activity, and the involvement of two receptors, Vmn2r65 and Vmn2r88, in infant-directed aggression was demonstrated by genetic deletion. Using the activation of these receptors as readouts for biochemical fractionation, we isolated two pheromonal compounds, the submandibular gland protein C and hemoglobins. Unexpectedly, none of the identified vomeronasal receptors and associated cues were specific to pups. Thus, infant-mediated aggression by virgin males relies on the recognition of pup’s physical traits in addition to parental and infant chemical cues.</p>

<p><em>violent proletarianisation: social murder, the reserve army of labour and social security ‘austerity’ in britain</em><br />

<p>Dr Chris Grover, who heads the University's Sociology Department, says austerity can be understood as a form of structural violence, violence that is built into society and is expressed in unequal power and unequal life chances, as it is deepens inequalities and injustices, and creates even more poverty.</p>
<p>The article, 'Violent proletarianisation: social murder, the reserve army of labour and social security 'austerity' in Britain', suggests that as a result of the violence of austerity working class people face harm to their physical and mental wellbeing and in some instances are 'socially murdered'.</p>
<p>Dr Grover uses the article to call on the Government for change and action.</p>
<p>He refers to the process as 'violent proletarianisation' (the idea that violent austerity is aimed at forcing people to do paid work, rather than being reliant upon benefits).</p>
<p>&quot;To address violent proletarianisation what is required is not the tweaking of existing policies but fundamental change that removes the economic need for people to work for the lowest wages that employers can get away with paying,&quot; says Dr Grover.</p>
<p>Published in the journal, Critical Social Policy, Dr Grover gives examples of where social security austerity has led to a range of harms:</p>
<p>an additional six suicides for every 10,000 work capability assessments done;<br />
increasing number of people Britain dying of malnutrition<br />
increasing numbers of homeless people dying on the streets or in hostels<br />
The article argues that austerity, the difficult economic conditions created by Government by cutting back on public spending, has brought cuts and damaging changes to social security policy meaning Britain has fallen victim to a brutal approach to forcing people to do low paid work.</p>
<p>&quot;The violence takes two forms,&quot; says Dr Grover. &quot;First it involves further economic hardship of already income-poor people.</p>
<p>&quot;It causes social inequalities and injustices in the short term and, in the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;Second, the poverty that violent proletarianisation creates is both known and avoidable.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Grover adds that only by fundamentally rethinking current social security policy can change that protects the poorest people be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> This article examines social security policy for working age people in Britain in the ‘age of austerity’. Drawing upon critical approaches to understanding social policy and violence, the article argues that severe cuts to benefits and the ratcheting up of conditionality for, and the sanctioning of, benefit recipients can be understood as ‘violent proletarianisation’ – using socio-economic inequality and injustice to force the commodification of labour power, and a consequential creation of diswelfares that are known and avoidable. The article suggests that violent proletarianisation is a contradictory process, one that helps constitute the working class, but in a way that socially murders some of its reserve army members.</p>

<em>environmentally mediated social dilemmas</em><br />

<p>absurdly well linked to moritz paper below, even the part about free movement being crucial!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether it’s a pasture open to public grazing or a batch of glucose colonized by microbes, a shared environmental resource is often depicted as a fixed quantity, doomed to depletion if individuals selfishly consume what they can.<br />
This “tragedy of the commons” is a well-known scenario in a broader class of social dilemmas that are used to characterize how individuals choose to cooperate or compete for shared resources.<br />
But these paradigmatic dilemmas may be too simplistic, according to an opinion piece in press at <em>Trends in Ecology and Evolution</em>. The article introduces real-world complexity to social dilemmas by accounting for the way individuals modify and adapt to the environments that surround them.<br />
“What we’ve been doing so far with humans and with microbes and with everything in between is oversimplified,” says evolutionary biologist Michael Hochberg, a Santa Fe Institute External Professor based at the University of Montpelier in France. Hochberg and his co-authors decided to investigate social dilemmas during two Santa Fe Institute working groups in 2016 and 2017.<br />
“What our work suggests is that sometimes simple models may fail to capture important features of the ecology of microbial interactions, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions,” writes Sylvie Estrela, an evolutionary microbiologist at Yale and the study’s lead author.<br />
To account for some of the complexity of real-world social dilemmas, the group created a classification system that goes beyond the basic model of individuals interacting, selfishly or cooperatively, over a fixed resource. Focusing on bacteria as an example, the group studied the dynamics that emerge as bacteria simultaneously help or harm their environment in one of four ways — enriching it with nutrients (helping), detoxifying it (helping), depleting the resources (harming), or polluting it with toxic excretions (harming).<br />
“It’s what the interactions are actually producing or consuming or modifying that becomes key,” Hochberg says. For instance, bacteria often excrete metabolic waste products that may end up being toxic to themselves and to other neighboring bacteria if the waste persists and accumulates in the environment. But in some cases, such metabolic waste can be food for other bacterial species. Thus, the same behavior can simultaneously harm and help because the same molecule can simultaneously be waste or food, respectively, depending on which microbes are present and how they interact with their environment.<br />
“So rather than having social behaviors that just depend upon interactions between two people or two microbes, the interactions might depend upon the state of the environment as well.”<br />
By accounting for the dynamics of the changing environment, the researchers revealed two layers of complexity absent from classic social dilemmas.<br />
The first of these is spatial. Unlike simple social dilemmas that depict what Hochberg calls “perpetual interactions in a given space,” the new taxonomy allows bacteria to move from a hostile environment to a more friendly one. So an enriching bacterium surrounded by polluters could relocate, changing the environment it enters and the one it leaves behind.<br />
Such explicit environmental dimensions can have important consequences for the evolution of migration. Estrela gives the example of two organisms that both help themselves and harm the other. “When we abstract away the environment, they both appear to have the same ‘social’ strategy. Intuitively, one would think that both types should follow the same migration strategy as well — that is move away from each other since they harm each other. But when one takes into account how the two organisms interact with each other and their environment, one finds that the outcome is actually more complex, and the two types may follow different migration strategies.”<br />
The second layer is temporal, dealing with niche construction and evolutionary dynamics that play out over time.<br />
“The idea is that when we modify our environments, those modifications can be longer and more durable than our own lifetimes,” Hochberg explains. “The ecological inheritance of social behaviors will influence future conditions, but because of the complexity of the system, it is difficult to know just how. This is very relevant to humans because the ways we are modifying our environments will go well beyond our lifetimes, with climate change as one example.”<br />
The next challenge, according to Estrela, is “to understand when a simple model is good enough to predict the dynamics and evolution of social interactions, when it is not, and where instead we need more complex and explicit models.”<br />
Though the paper doesn’t explicitly study social animals or humans, the general framework could be used to study analogous human behaviors such as restorative agriculture on the helping end of the spectrum, or overconsumption of fossil fuels as an example of harming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Organisms modify their environments in ways that can be beneficial or detrimental not only to themselves but also to others sharing the same environment.<br />
Such niche-constructing or niche-destroying activities are often due to the production or consumption of environmental factors, such as resources, wastes, or toxins, which ultimately influence the ecology and evolution of social interactions.<br />
We present a new, four-way classification of social behaviors where individual behaviors are categorized into producing/consuming an environmental factor, as well as into helping/harming others.<br />
Although not immediately obvious, dispersal (the act of moving within a habitat or between habitats) is another mechanism by which organisms modify their environment.<br />
An explicit representation of such environmentally mediated interactions is key to capturing realistic system complexity and can reveal some unexpected outcomes in social dilemmas.<br />
By consuming and producing environmental resources, organisms inevitably change their habitats. The consequences of such environmental modifications can be detrimental or beneficial not only to the focal organism but also to other organisms sharing the same environment. Social evolution theory has been very influential in studying how social interactions mediated by public ‘goods’ or ‘bads’ evolve by emphasizing the role of spatial structure. The environmental dimensions driving these interactions, however, are typically abstracted away. We propose here a new, environment-mediated taxonomy of social behaviors where organisms are categorized by their production or consumption of environmental factors that can help or harm others in the environment. We discuss microbial examples of our classification and highlight the importance of environmental intermediates more generally.</p>

<p>the tragedy of the commons – minus the tragedy: people can sustainably share resources, under some conditions</p>
<p><em>emergent sustainability in open property regimes</em><br />
mark moritz et al. 2018<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812028115">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812028115</a></p>

<p>Scientists have long believed that when there is open access to a shared resource, people will inevitably overuse it, leading to ruin for everyone - an idea known as the “tragedy of the commons.”<br />
But in an analysis of eight case studies from around the world - from foragers in Australia to mangrove fishers in Ecuador - researchers found that people can successfully share and sustainably use resources, under certain conditions.<br />
“We’ve been told that if there is open access, then there must be tragedy, but that’s simply not true,” said Mark Moritz, lead author of the paper and associate professor of anthropology at The Ohio State University.<br />
“We’ve been blinded by the theoretical models. Using a new approach has helped us see from a different perspective.”<br />
The paper was published today (11-26-18) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br />
The classic example of the tragedy of the commons is shepherds who share an open pasture. Each shepherd adds to the number of animals he has, because use of the grazing land is free. But the result is that the land is overgrazed, leaving it ruined for everyone.<br />
But Moritz knew from his own research that this tragedy is not inevitable. He studies pastoralists in Cameroon for whom “keeping livestock is a way of life for them, as well as a way to make a living,” he said.<br />
They live nomadically, seasonally moving cattle from place to place, sharing the grazing land but not depleting the resources.<br />
In the PNAS paper, Moritz and his colleagues compared the cases they knew, which have been studied ethnographically for decades and for which they had long-term social and ecological data.<br />
They found that the successful case studies worked as complex adaptive systems, where interactions between social and ecological processes lead to sustainable outcomes.<br />
Successful systems were self-organizing, resulting in efficient, equitable and sustainable resource use.<br />
“There is no central decision making or collective decision making about resource use. Individual users decide when and where to move or harvest resources. The system self-organizes so that the distribution of resources matches the distribution of the users,” Moritz said.<br />
While open access implies no rules, Moritz said there actually are rules. People usually need to ask permission from current users to use a resource, such as grazing land. But permission is almost always granted.<br />
The researchers found that to avoid the tragedy of the commons, people have to use the environmental resources appropriately. In Cameroon, that means pastoralists move their cattle in response to seasonal rains that bring the grasses on which their animals feed.<br />
“The inappropriate way to use the resources would be to put up a fence and keep the animals there throughout the year, even during periods when there is no rain and the grass isn’t growing,” Moritz said.<br />
That’s why freedom of movement is one of the key conditions necessary to successfully share resources. Other necessary conditions include low population densities, low market value of the resources, variability in resource distribution and an ethos of sharing.<br />
The researchers say that where the conditions are right for successful and sustainable use, there is no need to “manage” the resources, Moritz said.<br />
“The standard approach is to protect the resource. But you can’t see the resource in isolation. We have to look at the social-ecological system as a whole,” he said.<br />
“People are part of the ecosystem. They are not managing the ecosystem, they are using it. You can’t separate people from resources they are use.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of the commons. However, in many open-access systems, use of common-pool resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these dynamics in eight case studies of different social–ecological systems, including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons. Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of social–ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.</p>

<p>December marks the 50th anniversary of the paper that popularized the concept of tragedy of the commons: it argued that individuals will always take advantage of a common resource and so degrade it. A new paper argues that the theory limits the way climate change is viewed.</p>
<p>&quot;New findings about how people understand and act suggest that climate change will more likely be solved by appealing to moral arguments rather than purely scientific ones,&quot; said Professor Katrina Brown, one of the paper's authors.</p>
<p>Professor Brown and Professor Neil Adger, both from the University of Exeter, and Professor Joshua Cinner from James Cook University, say that in order to make urgently needed progress in addressing climate change, governments need to promote climate change as a moral issue. And policy needs acknowledge that politicians often make their decisions based on reputation.</p>
<p>&quot;Doing the right thing matters to people, but not everyone agrees what the right thing is. Some people emphasize fairness, others duty and patriotism. We need to appeal to the full range of these values,&quot; said Professor Cinner, co-author of the new paper in the journal Global Environmental Change.</p>
<p>They argue new ways of speaking about climate change that focus on the wide variety values and priorities of people with conservative and liberal views should be harnessed to encourage more concern and action on climate change.</p>
<p>American ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin wrote his paper &quot;The tragedy of the commons&quot; in 1968.</p>
<p>Lead author, Professor Brown, said: &quot;Hardin's theory has been very influential. It has been used to design global co-operation on climate change such as the Paris Agreement. But there is a rapidly closing window to transform the economy and avoid climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>&quot;New social science points the way to political mobilization based on sense of duty, respect for nature and others, and solidarity. These are now more relevant and more likely to win the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Addressing climate change requires building inclusive moral frames, and fundamental changes in governance systems to better manage the associated risks.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>paper</em> The Tragedy of the Commons argued that global human population was on a path of unsustainable growth through the use of a parable of over-grazing of livestock on common land (Hardin, 1968). The concept of ‘the tragedy of the commons’ largely assumes that individuals are solely motivated by self-interest, an assumotion increasingly at odds with insights across the social sciences (Van Vugt, 2009). The original article, and idea of the tragedy, has had a profound influence on science and policy across all environmental issues. In the five decades since its publication, a concerted scientific response by multiple disciplines, synthesised in Elinor Ostrom (1990), has depended the of the causes of environmental overexploitation. Such work has documented commons dilemmas and assembled evidence that collective action can be mobilised at various scales to avoid tragedies in population, in overfishing, in resource consumption, and in land degradation. Many argue, however, that global climate change represents the ultimate Hardin-style tragedy: the global commons of the atmosphere cannot realistically be enclosed or effectively managed, and power asymmetries and concentrated benefits from fossil fuel use mean that irreversible thresholds will be crossed before the costs are fully realised (Jamieson, 2014).</p>
<p>Yet this pervasive framing of climate change as a commons tragedy limits how we confront the climate challenge. Insights from two key areas of political and behavioural sciences are expanding the potential solution space by highlighting how climate change is a dilemma of decision-making and moral values rather than simply a global resource – or global commons – tragedy. First, collective decision-making is as much about managing risks to political systems and their legitimacy, so-called second order risks, as it is about managing the physical and material risks of climate change as documented by science. Second, emerging psychology research demonstrates the range of moral underpinnings that can be mobilised for effective collection action on climate change. These insights shift emphasis away from a commons tragedy to more complex set of governance challenges.</p>
<p>Here we reflect on the relevance of Hardin’s thesis fifty years after its publication to today’s global challenges, and particularly in the context of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C which highlights a rapidly closing window of little more than a decade to transform the relationship between society and climate (IPCC, 2018).</p>
<ol>
<li>Second order risks<br />
To date, much climate change science has been focused on first order risks – the impacts of weather extremes and climate disruptions, or the costs of pathways to decarbonisation. Policy is often assumed to seek technical solutions to address these first order risks as they occur or are predicted. Yet mounting evidence suggests that second order risks, which refer to reputation and authority of management actors, dominate how key actors take decisions and prioritise actions. These second order risks include the blame and threats to legitimacy that individuals (e.g. political leaders) or organisations (e.g. governments or businesses) need to manage in order to maintain power and efficacy, and are often thought of as reputation management. Political scientists highlight how reputational risk forms the pervasive logic of organisations and is re-shaping and re-defining risk management agendas as the cornerstone of good governance (Power et al., 2009).</li>
</ol>
<p>The influence of second order risks explains apparently maladaptive behaviours and decisions. The response of governments and local authorities to extreme weather events such as floods, for example, shows how decisions on recovery and long run adaptation are distorted by having to manage second order risks. After severe storms battered the southwest of the UK during winter of 2013-14, the wettest winter in 175 year records and attributable to underlying climatic changes (Schaller et al., 2016), there was considerable pressure on local government to re-build coastal defences rather than implement longer term proactive adaptation strategies (Brown et al., 2017). Responses to the perceived emergency prompted new alliances between different authorities, organisations at different scales and different domains of work, and between public and private sector. These new partnerships in turn amplified the significance of second order risks for different governance actors. This all took place in a context of budget cuts and greater demands for accountability in public funding, stimulating short-term fixes rather than long-term adaptation.</p>
<p>As climate governance becomes increasingly focused on multi-stakeholder collaboration, resultant shifts in public and private responsibilities move emphasis from managing first order risks – the traditional domain of biophysical sciences and engineering – to second order risks, which require negotiation with new partners (Kuklicke and Demeritt, 2016). This is highlighted in the IPCC Special Report (IPCC, 2018), which stresses that meeting the challenge of a 1.5 °C temperature increase requires new forms of multi-level governance that includes non-state actors. The report recognises that this in turn needs enhanced capacities and accountability. This requires reframing climate change not as a simply a physical threat but as an issue that threatens the legitimacy and stability of governance systems and actors.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Moral positions<br />
Research from psychology and ethics shows that people’s behaviour and attitudes, including those towards climate change, are fundamentally shaped by a diversity of moral concerns (Lakoff, 2010) (Fig. 1). For example, moral foundations theory highlights universal moral pillars such as protection from harm, fairness, loyalty (in-group, patriotism, and duty), respect for authority and tradition, and purity (Graham et al., 2009; Feinberg and Willer, 2013; Adger et al., 2017). These pillars help to form the foundations for a diversity of moral framings of and associated discourses on climate change (Feinberg and Willer, 2013). For example, Rossen et al. (2015) surveyed Australian adults about their stated beliefs around climate change, finding that those who claimed to be sceptical of climate change did so because of the perceived moral need to maintain the status quo (Rossen et al., 2015). In effect, this population justified their beliefs as moral due to their respect for authority and for the status quo as an overriding imperative. But for others, libertarian moral underpinnings about the rightness of free markets explained their scepticism.</li>

Fig. 1. Diverse moral foundations underpinning attitiudes to climate change.</p>
<p>Critically, viewing climate change as a moral, rather than a technical resource scarcity issue can help to provide more impactful climate change framings. Across societies, conservatives tend to consider purity, respect for authority, and loyalty as more important than progressives do (Rossen et al., 2015). Understanding the importance of these moral priorities provides opportunities to frame climate change issues in ways that tap into the diverse moral foundations relevant to conservatives. Additionally, a moral perspective on climate change can also help explain why many prevalent arguments fail to resonate with climate sceptics.</p>
<p>Although protection from harm and fairness tend to be ranked equally highly by both progressives and conservatives, the latter’s perceptions of fairness tend to be viewed through a lens of moral hierarchy that places humans above nature and the rich above the poor (Lakoff, 2010). So, while the impacts of climate change on the Earth’s biodiversity (Hughes et al., 2018) and the world’s poor (Hsiang et al., 2017; Bathiany et al., 2018) regularly make headlines and raise public consciousness, these are unlikely be considered unfair to climate sceptics as these popular framings of distributional impacts are not in line with their moral hierarchy. Morals matter, and appropriately appealing to the diversity of moral values could substantially reduce opposition to climate change science and policies. Reframing climate change for its moral consequences is not just the domain of religious or other leaders.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A new framing<br />
Hardin’s analysis relied heavily on an over-grazing parable, in effect a moral tale of the collective tragedy caused by the ‘rational’ greed of individual cattle herders. We are not advocating a new parable: any over-simplified story is clearly problematic. But the power of parables is in their ability to illustrate a moral issue. Indeed, the subtitle of Hardin’s article, was that the population problem he analysed ‘has no technical solution: it requires a fundamental extension of morality’ (Hardin, 1968, p. 1243). We assert that addressing climate change requires building the necessary system of moral frames, and fundamental changes in governance systems to better manage both first and second order risks.</li>

This is the reason that concentration of power is bad, because it multiplies the effect of people acting irresponsibly.<br />
The reason religion can become bad is because by definition, religion is regarded as the highest authority. Religious abusers believe that the rules of human society do not apply to them, because they obey a higher law, that which is revealed to them in their religion. This would be okay if the higher law was still true, but unfortunately an unchanging higher law becomes false very quickly, and the higher law then becomes a tool for abusing others.<br />
After four thousand years of transcription I wouldn't wonder if even the best message gets distorted. We can't lay blame at the feet of a few religions. Can we really expect that nothing would have happened in the meantime? If not this, then something else would have happened.<br />

<ul>
<li>why do so many people want to be right? because there is a spell which binds them to believe that to be worthy, they must be right.
<ul>
<li>i hate being right, because they believed that if they admitted I was right, then they would be shown to be wrong, and that this would be bad. why did they think being right was so important?</li>
<li>self protection from remorse: if someone spends many years doing something, and believed that they needed to deliberately sacrifice in order to do this, would it not be devastating to face the possibility that all they did was for naught, or resulted in furthering someone else's ends rather than their own, or even badly abused others for the sake of selfish, irresponsible reasons?</li>
<li>self protection for status: in that culture, it was taught that to be right was to be good, and to be wrong was evil –– if you admitted you were wrong, or that you could be or had been wrong, it was implied that you would always be wrong, and even that you were evil and must be cast out and despised. why was this taught? because it was the mechanism used to abuse power. by inculcating this in people, the abusers maintained they were right and good and to be given power, and thus that their opponents were wrong and evil and must be killed. the people were to believe this to be true, to be correct, to be right; for to doubt, or question, or believe otherwise was wrong, evil, and deserving of retribution.</li>
<li>so the system of ethics in a culture, maintained by a society, can enable abusive people to take power away from others, withhold and wield it. this is why understanding of ethics is practical, if one wishes to wield power responsibly, and to fight abuse.</li>
<li>interestingly, to accept responsibility is to also accept that one has power. is this because responsibility is the name for what we expect when power is given –– that the receiver is to use the power for responsible acts?</li>

<li>just as some of the most abusively homophobic are those who are closeted homosexuals, because they want to signal their fake virtue by their abuse; so too some of the most abusively righteous are those who are secret sinners, because they want to signal their fake virtue by their abuse</li>
</ul>

<h2>02817</h2>
<ul>
<li>people have a justification system for their beliefs and behaviours. one that allows them to say that the victims that they make deserve their fates.
<ul>
<li>what causes this? is it because of an imposed or self–imposed scarcity, a paucity of options?</li>
<li>this is the link between belief, choice, and action, how they are really part of the same thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>02717</h2>
<ul>
<li>there are those who believe that having understood a part of reality, they are entitled to exploit those that do not understand. is this the basic moral failing? where someone with a temporary advantage uses it to gain continued advantage?
<ul>
<li>we need to understand that there will always be people like this. but that does not mean we should let them take power over us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>02617</h2>
<ul>
<li>with beauty and power too, the privileged are more often irresponsible in their behaviour. it is often interesting to see how people behave towards you when they believe you are not as privileged as they are.</li>
<li>just because people who are are the most abusive happen to be also privileged, does not mean that privileged people are all abusive. to do so would be as nonsensical as saying people who are most abusive happen to be also alive, therefore living people are all abusive. while it is literally true that all people are abusive, the useful information becomes corrupted when abusive people claim that any particular group is more abusive than any other — in reality, no group is more abusive than any other, we are all abusive because we are all deluded. the difficulty with people who are both abusive and privileged is not that they are privileged, but that privilege in most forms leads to, derives from, and is sustained by concentration of power, and it is concentration of power that magnifies the effect of each person’s inherent abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02517</h2>
<ul>
<li>people do not intend to become abusive. people slowly build up bad habits and attitudes that lead to worse things. the same is true of good things however.
<ul>
<li>It is not that people are evil; even well–meaning people do harm when they don't try to understand what they do. It isn't their prejudice or your difference from them, it is a lack of care that is innate because they are not ready.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there may be no such thing as truth, but there are many lies. you can tell how abusive someone is by how much they lie.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02417</h2>
<ul>
<li>the concept of selfishness can be misleading, because it implies that people intend to be selfish — but perhaps most people who act selfishly, who act abusively, do not, for whatever reason, currently have the ability to think how their actions affect others.
<ul>
<li>It may be, that in the human evolutionary past, that selfishness served a useful purpose — rather than being abusive. Our response to threats and scarcity may have been adaptive, on a small scale in dire emergencies and even then the effect was limited by the small reach of humans. But to speculate on this may not be worthwhile, as there might not be an answer to find. What we need to deal with is the huge abusive effect that our human selfishness causes now in the world, because our cumulative impact is now so massive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>02317</h2>
<ul>
<li>abusive people are in pain but this does not absolve them of responsibility.
<ul>
<li>abusers may be wrong, but this doesn't stop them from having a horrible impact on the earth and our lives.</li>
<li>abusers aren’t wrong — if you want to live with abusers.</li>
<li>does not mean abusers abusing okay, nor that they are worthless</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>02217</h2>
<ul>
<li>because people trap themselves in their circumstances, they feel they cannot escape and feel as if they have no options. to make themselves feel better, some may use others, perhaps unkindly.
<ul>
<li>their lives have become empty, and they try anything to fill the void within, but they fail, for the void can only be filled by one thing — themselves</li>
<li>people so trapped by their own pain they care not the pain they cause others, nor can help each other recover.</li>

<li>there are many fine paths just as there are many awful ones. but choosing to follow an awful path makes it harder each time to change to a fine one</li>
<li>manipulations of scale: by making us believe there are things that are much worse or much better than others, they manipulate us to want those “better” things, and to neglect or tolerate “lesser” evils.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01817</h2>
<ul>
<li>for some abusers, the reason for gaining power is to cause chaos. they wish to disable the working and growth of civilisation for the gain of abusers waiting to take advantage of the chaos.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01717</h2>
<ul>
<li>so basically the problems in the world come down to the same thing. how do we deal with a person who behaves abusively, and they are our supposed guardians, our partners, and ourselves?
<ul>
<li>and the corollary is how do we live, purposefully, joyfully, compassionately?</li>
<li>it is no use telling an abuser that they are an abuser, that what they are doing is wrong. if they could act otherwise, they would already have done so. all we can do is wait and hope that one day they will change, and in the meantime try to reduce the damage they do.</li>

<p>once, a long time ago, they too loved, but they lost it.<br />
is it our response to that inevitable loss that determines our individual fates?</p>
<ul>
<li>what the abusers can never have is true love and friendship</li>
<li>power as destroyer. people who forget how to create can only destroy. their lives are empty of real love and connection, not because no one would love them, but because they can no longer accept love.</li>
<li>abusers are those who were, possibly through no fault of their own, unable to deal with the abuse they faced as children</li>
<li>people are so disappointed by the abuse they face in the world, that the become hardened and perpetuate the poison that destroyed them</li>
<li>abusive people fear loneliness. they fear it so much it consumes them. yet others, even though they may not understand why they do so, draw away and are disgusted by the abusive person's destructive behaviour — it is in the consciousness of our species to do so, because we know abuse should be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01517</h2>
<ul>
<li>all the so–called sins arise from fear, just as fear arises from separation from reality. rather than ignorance, it is both not knowing and not dealing with what cannot be known that leads to separation from reality.
<ul>
<li>hate comes from fear, and fear comes from abuse.</li>
<li>abusers, bullies, aggressors, why do they not change for the better? they fear what change would bring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01417</h2>
<ul>
<li>how do situations arise and how do we perpetuate them? how do abusers manage to continue their abuse, when the people they abuse (one would initially think) could escape?
<ul>
<li>it may be that the differing models of behaviour, fearful and trusting, are suitable to different societal conditions, i.e. chaos and order. the mechanisms abusive people use to perpetuate a condition that is fruitful (at least in the short term) for them but inimical to others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01317</h2>
<ul>
<li>given that people do behave abusively sometimes, and some more often and more deeply than we can bear at that time, how do we comport ourselves? when we meet more people, the proportion of abusive actions we encounter may stay the &quot;same&quot; but the effect on us may be disproportionately large – it is not proportions of abuse but abuse itself that affects us. also, abuse can be very deep and extreme, even life–threatening. how do we deal with this? it is tempting to withdraw, just to not expose ourselves to those people acting abusively. however, this way can never, by definition, lead to a responsible society. we can build shields and weapons against abuse, but these can lead to problems too – general loss of sensitivity instead of specific protection against abuse, weapons readied and used when inappropriate and unnecessary.</li>

<li>those who would abuse us, who would use us for their own ends.</li>
<li>they use our own instincts against us.
<ul>
<li>abuse is revolting: visceral response to abuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>they tell us to seek salvation out there, when salvation can only come from within each of us.</li>
<li>whether it is virtue, or goodness, or love, or beauty, or knowledge, or money, whatever is most valued, the abuser seeks to create a scarcity, a monopoly, so that they can gain power over others.</li>
<li>abusive people accrete power by destroying the ability of others to defend themselves. in so doing, they make their own downfall a certainty.</li>

<ul>
<li>the society we build every day with our own two hands — if we let the powerful rape and pillage the powerless — if we let society make abusers powerful</li>
<li>it is abuse to “sacrifice the few to save the many” — the answer is in not making a society that asks us to do this, where the rich and powerful take so much that the poor and powerless must fight each other just to live</li>

<ul>
<li>a sane person might wonder, “why would any person set out to become an abusive person?” and indeed, much of what contributes to how a person becomes abusive is plain chance occurrence: who they meet in life and other encounters along the way. but there are active poisoners, those who seek to destroy people and the fabric of society for no reason — they have become completely abusive, and likely can no longer change for the better. they coerce and force others to become abusive like them, through mental abuse like brainwashing. it is like a zombie plague where the poisonous, sickening bite from one turns the next into the same.</li>
<li>they don't want you to learn, because questioning the belief they have infected you with is the only way to destroy their power over us all.</li>
<li>where they seek to bind you, whether with hate or love or things or freedom — it is still binding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00817</h2>
<ul>
<li>capacity for review
<ul>
<li>could it be that too much self–absorption is the root cause? when we are so concerned with our selves that we neglect the effect of our actions on others, and take offence at others' actions because they are not ideal for us, then we start to become more irresponsible and abusive.</li>
<li>is this why power corrupts, because we lose our capacity to review our actions, when we remove those who would point out we are no longer right?</li>
<li>they only test their information once, if at all. we need to examine our beliefs and concepts often if we want to live closer to reality.</li>
<li>when do people lose the urge to better themselves?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00717</h2>
<ul>
<li>concentration of power
<ul>
<li>The human military, like its science or religion or politics, is a tool which human society uses to perpetuate itself. These tools, like human society and civilisation, are not abusive because we can see what they do, but because the concentration of power, in almost any form, is a poison.</li>
<li>The single most salient aid to the concentrated abuse of power in recent history is fossil fuels. As fossil fuels become scarce, the abusers who are not ignorant of processes become desperate in their bid to cling to power. They turn to war and oppression and manipulation.</li>
<li>that there are people who would taint baby milk formula with poison is both horrible and inevitable, but it doesn’t mean we cannot do anything. sadly we are all in the position of poisoning the world of future generations, through our use of chemicals and fossil fuels and nuclear, through war and industry and technology — but like those who taint baby milk, we deny that destroying the future is wrong, as we do not truly understand what we do.</li>
<li>problem of weapons and dangerous tools is when people forget the danger — then there is little safeguard from tragedy. this is true in general of society, and is the great tragedy of civilisation</li>
<li>the idea of the division of labour leads to institutions and concentration of power. not all bad, even if does often seem so.</li>
<li>used to be mainly concentration via slavery, now it is concentration via fossil fuels and slavery. both have consequences.</li>
<li>preparing for aging
<ul>
<li>our ability and chance of doing harm increases as we get older, and is less balanced by future potential to do good. this is simply how concentration of power and limited life and cognitive abilities turn out.</li>
<li>unlike becoming different sexes or races, many (not all) of us will have the chance to grow old, so we should prepare for this eventuality — though today in common with other eventualities, most people are not able to prepare for their own aging</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00617</h2>
<ul>
<li>three questions; firstly, what is truly responsible behaviour — what is virtue, and process of understanding knowledge. secondly, how do we change our own behaviour now we understand our own behaviour is not virtuous, and that of others — process of reflection and communiation. finally, how do we behave now we understand that there will always be processes beyond our present understanding — process of evolution and diversity.</li>
<li>limits of abilities
<ul>
<li>they have reached the limits of their abilities, and that is okay. everyone is different and has different parts to play in life. you must take care of your physical and mental well–being when they are no longer capable of understanding that their behaviour has become abusive.</li>
<li>it is simply harder for us to understand that which we do not experience — that is the nature of it. if we wish to understand we must experience it somehow, whether by accident, intention, imagination. for people who live without experiencing a wide range of things may seem narrower–minded compared to the rest of us, and more prone to abusive behaviour.</li>
<li>is the inability or lack of adequate ability to understand consequences of our behaviour a major factor in why humans act abusively?</li>
<li>and the different kinds of abuser acting concurrently that make the situation seem intractable? if so would it be an advantage to identify the major types of abuser?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00517</h2>
<ul>
<li>sustaining myths
<ul>
<li>abusers use a twisted version of Darwin’s theory of evolution to justify and promote their abuse and suppression of people — they say, “if we do not keep the plebs at bay, we, the chosen, shall be overrun”.</li>
<li>competition is mischaracterised; neither red in tooth and claw (predator—prey) nor harem (stags, silverbacks) are generally true. rather than predator–prey, is symbiosis. rather than harem, is mate choice. in both is diversity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00417</h2>
<ul>
<li>abuse, is, at heart, the inability to reconcile our inner representation of reality — with reality as it truly is.
<ul>
<li>
<p>because reality changes, we must change our inner representations of it to match. the problem comes when we no longer do so. this is why change, and momentum — the flow of change — are such essential ideas and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pride is a limitation for learning.<br />
An unprepared enemy can still overwhelm you.<br />
Pride and sloth are addictions, excuses not to face reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sadly, all fixed belief systems are likely to be, or become abusive. they set people and the world up for failure, because they cannot even nearly represent reality</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00317</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all people blind to (truly unaware of) our own mistakes — otherwise why would we still be making them? but essential difference is our current awareness of this something–of–which–we–cannot–be–aware, and what we do about it.</p>
<p>we might argue that we know what needs to be done, or that circumstances are beyond our control, but the question simply becomes: why do we not act to change our lives for the better?</p>
<ul>
<li>we unintentionally act harmfully, and this will always be true. but we can learn to do better, and try to repair the harm we cause</li>
<li>all people are abusers, some deny it is so</li>
<li>what is it like to understand that without constant vigilance and massive effort on your part, and a whole lot of luck which you may not get, that you will end up being as abusive as the previous generation, and all those that came before them?</li>
<li>people often believe that what they are doing is responsible, even if in fact it is abusive. so sometimes it takes an extraordinary turn of events before people are willing and ready to re–examine how we live our lives.</li>
<li>we all have moral failings. those that think they do not are delusional. but that does not mean we should not work at resolving our failings, making them into successes.</li>
<li>so many people have the chance to change their own habits, the habits that are killing themselves and others. in whose interest is it that this process continues, that we keep killing ourselves?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00217</h2>
<ul>
<li>but it is an illusion, too, that we choose whether we become abusive. it is chance circumstance that leads us to where we are today, perhaps able to live more responsibly, but also perhaps abusively.</li>
<li>is the response of abusive behaviour to abusive behaviour adaptive simply because in the absence of other learning, it is an aid to survival? in other words, in a better situation where we know, understand, and can use different responses that are not abusive, these are more adaptive — the issue being that we do not always have access to such responses without lucky circumstance or training</li>
</ul>
<h2>00117</h2>
<ul>
<li>what we call abusive is an excessive misunderstanding of reality, with harsh practical consequences. people acting abusively are best avoided, though occasionally they should be approached to try to break their curse, most likely they will have to break it themselves, if they ever do.</li>
<li>when someone I know is abusive to me, I do not wish to react by abusing them back. but by withdrawing my active cooperation, effectively i do so. I try to make sure that their behaviour was not misinterpreted, or by chance, and to review it in future in case they change. although I believe that nobody is abusive if we could be otherwise than abusive at that moment, there is no immutable judgement, it is practical to take action to avoid further abuse, given that they are at that moment unlikely to change their abusive behaviour. but even then, like most people, I tend to wait too long to do this, and suffer through much abuse, while trying without success to change their abusive behaviour. the ultimate answer may be that we can only really change our own behaviour, so that to work on changing my own beliefs and habits may be only way forward for each and every one of us, because we are only able to truly accept external input at unpredictable times.</li>
<li>have you ever wondered why our world is the way it is? we all contribute to our culture, this culture which is sick and abusive — and we are all abusive, no matter whether we believe so or not — yet we can also cherish and flourish too. in religious shorthand, “we all sin, yet we all redeem”, in secular shorthand, “we all abuse, and nevertheless also cherish”.</li>
<li>no matter whether our abuse is intended or unintended, it is still abuse. The only way to change this is if we ourselves continue to change and grow and adapt to reality. Unfortunately, almost our entire culture and civilisation works against this. We must find not only what reality is, and how it changes and grows, and how to flourish, but do so almost despite our culture and civilisation.</li>
<li>we are all abusers in some way, the only difference is between those who are still trying to do better than they have done, and those who no longer try.
<ul>
<li>so–called evil is never far away, as it is unceased abuse, and every one of us, due to the constant change of reality and our relatively slow ability to adapt to it, creates abuse. This abuse that we all perpetuate each day, and the abuse perpetuated by demagogues and extremists, is not so different as we are led to believe.</li>
<li>Happily, the process of solving this is also much easier than we are led to believe. Learning to face reality and grow with it is no small thing, but it is not only possible, but also is doable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>people do not want to believe that our behaviour, at root, has no rational basis; that ultimately our behaviour is as if it were controlled by spells that were cast by a fairy godmother. in refusing to examine the root of our behaviour, it becomes only a rare chance occurrence that we can change our behaviour to deal with changing circumstances.</li>
