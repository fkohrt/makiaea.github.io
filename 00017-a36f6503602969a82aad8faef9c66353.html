Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the evaluation of events occurring several decades in the future as well as the role of core values in these processes. Thirty-six participants viewed a series of events, consisting of potential consequences of climate change, which could occur in the near future (around 2030), and thus would be experienced by the participants themselves, or in the far future (around 2080). We observed increased activation in anterior VMPFC (BA11), a region involved in encoding the personal significance of future events, when participants were envisioning far future events, demonstrating for the first time that the role of the VMPFC in future projection extends to the time scale of decades. Importantly, this activation increase was observed only in participants with pronounced self-transcendence values measured by self-report questionnaire, as shown by a statistically significant interaction of temporal distance and value structure. These findings suggest that future projection mechanisms are modulated by self-transcendence values to allow for a more extensive simulation of far future events. Consistent with this, these participants reported similar concern ratings for near and far future events, whereas participants with pronounced self-enhancement values were more concerned about near future events. Our findings provide a neural substrate for the tendency of individuals with pronounced self-transcendence values to consider the long-term consequences of their actions.</li>

<p><em>political extremism is supported by an illusion of understanding</em><br />

<ul>
<li>“generating mechanistic explanations leads people to endorse more moderate positions by forcing them to confront their ignorance. In contrast, reasons can draw on values, hearsay, and general principles that do not require much knowledge.”</li>
<li>“suggest a corrective for several psychological phenomena that make polarization self-reinforcing. People often are unaware of their own ignorance (Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999), seek out information that supports their current preferences (Nickerson, 1998), process new information in biased ways that strengthen their current preferences (Lord, Ross, &amp; Lepper, 1979), affiliate with other people who have similar preferences (Lazarsfeld &amp; Merton, 1954), and assume that other people’s views are as extreme as their own (Van Boven, Judd, &amp; Sherman, 2012). In sum, several psychological factors increase extremism, and attitude polarization is therefore hard to avoid. Explanation generation will by no means eliminate extremism, but our data suggest that it offers a means of counteracting a tendency supported by multiple psychological factors. In that sense, it promises to be an effective debiasing procedure.”</li>

<p><em>benefiting from disagreement: counterarguing reduces prechoice bias in information evaluation authors</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Confirmatory information processing (i.e., information distortion) is a robust phenomenon with no known mitigation. This research proposes that information distortion might be mitigated by disrupting its driver, namely, the need for cognitive consistency. Priming a counter-arguing mindset should induce people to refute their emerging preferences, thereby disrupting the operation of cognitive consistency. Five studies confirm this prediction. Study 1 demonstrates that priming a counter-arguing mindset decreases information distortion. Studies 2 and 3 replicate Study 1 and further show that the influence of a head start on choice diminishes when counter-arguing is primed. Study 4 shows that priming counter-arguing inhibits consistency-related concepts. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that counter-arguing not only reduces distortion but also yields reduced commitment to the preferred alternative.</li>

<p><em>the political economy of ideas: on ideas versus interests in policymaking</em><br />

<ul>
<li>We develop a conceptual framework to highlight the role of ideas as a catalyst for policy and institutional change. We make an explicit distinction between ideas and vested interests and show how they feed into each other. In doing so the paper integrates the Keynes-Hayek perspective on the importance of ideas with the currently more fashionable Stigler-Becker (in-terests only) approach to political economy. We distinguish between two kinds of ideational politics – the battle among different worldviews on the efficacy of policy (worldview politics) versus the politics of victimhood, pride and identity (identity politics). Political entrepreneurs discover identity and policy ‘memes’ (narratives, cues, framing) that shift beliefs about how the world works or a person’s belief of who he is (i.e. identity). Our framework identifies a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrates how they may reinforce each other. In particular, an increase in identity polarization may be associated with a shift in views about how the world works. Furthermore, an increase in income inequality is likely to result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. Finally, we show how ideas may not just constrain, but also ‘bite’ the interests that helped propagate them in the first instance.</li>

<p><em>perceived conflict and leader dominance: individual and contextual factors behind preferences for dominant leaders</em><br />
lasse laustsen, michael bang petersen 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pops.12403">dx.doi.org/10.1111/pops.12403</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent research finds that political candidates and leaders with dominant, masculine physical features are more preferred under conditions of conflict than of cooperation. Importantly, however, methodological limitations of past research have hindered the identification of whether this effect reflects that voters intuitively view (1) dominant leaders as more competent in solving problems of conflict, (2) nondominant leaders as more competent in solving problems of cooperation, or (3) both. In this article, we utilize recent advances in evolutionary psychology to form precise predictions on the nature of the underlying psychology and employ an unprecedented array of data types—including highly controlled experiments, natural experiments, and behavioral measures—to investigate the validity of these predictions. Using large approximately nationally representative surveys of 2,009 Poles and Ukrainians fielded during the Crimea crisis in 2014, we find that preferences for leader dominance are exclusively driven by the intuition that dominant leaders are better able to facilitate aggressive responses during social conflict and that these preferences are regulated by contextual conditions and individual predispositions related to such responses.</li>

<ul>
<li>Is structure good or bad for creativity? When it comes to organizing information, management scholars have long advocated for a hierarchical information structure (information organized around higher-order categories as opposed to a flat information structure where there is no higher-order category) to reduce complexity of information processing and increase efficiency of work. However, a hierarchical informa-tion structure can be a double-edged sword that may reduce creativity, defined as novel and useful combination of existing information. This is because a hierarchical information structure might obstruct combining information from distal conceptual categories. Thus, the current research investigates whether information structure influences creativity. We theorize that a hierarchical information struc-ture, compared to a flat information structure, will reduce creativity because it reduces cognitive flexibil-ity. Three experiments using a sentence construction task and a LEGO task supported our prediction.</li>

<p><em>originals: how non–conformists move the world</em><br />
adam grant 2016 9780698405776</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing theirs. It’s hard to change other people’s ideals. It’s much easier to link our agendas to familiar values that people already hold.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at bridgewater, “In the language of futurist Paul Saffo, the norm is to have “strong opinions, weakly held.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By devoting more than an hour to the debate on that matter, employees reached consensus that they needed to push one another to share original ideas. That transparency would shield them against groupthink, enabling them to avoid countless bad decisions over time. By building a culture in which people are constantly encouraging one another to disagree, Dalio has created a powerful way to combat conformity. Yet the kind of disagreement he seeks is the opposite of what most leaders invite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hofmann found that a culture that focuses too heavily on solutions becomes a culture of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you’re always expected to have an answer ready, you’ll arrive at meetings with your diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to learn from a broad range of perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ray Dalio doesn’t want employees to bring him solutions; he expects them to bring him problems. One of his first inventions was the issue log, an open-access database for employees to flag any problem they identify and to rate its severity. Getting problems noted is half the battle against groupthink; the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. The Bridgewater procedure for the latter is to gather a group of credible people to diagnose the problems, share their reasoning, and explore the causes and possible solutions.</p>
<p>Although everyone’s opinions are welcome, they’re not all valued equally. Bridgewater is not a democracy. Voting privileges the majority, when the minority might have a better opinion. “Democratic decision making—one person, one vote—is dumb,” Dalio explains, “because not everybody has the same believability.”*</p>
<p>At Bridgewater, every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. In sports, statistics for every player’s performance history are public. In baseball, before you sign a player, you can look up his batting average, home runs, and steals; assess his strengths and weaknesses; and adjust accordingly. Dalio wanted Bridgewater to work the same way, so he created baseball cards that display statistics on every employee’s performance, which can be accessed by anyone at the company. If you’re about to interact with a few Bridgewater colleagues for the first time, you can see their track records on seventy-seven different dimensions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, and organization and reliability.</p>
<p>During regular review cycles, employees rate one another on different qualities like integrity, courage, living in truth, taking the bull by its horns, not tolerating problems, being willing to touch a nerve, fighting to get in sync, and holding people accountable. Between cycles, employees can give real-time, open feedback to anyone in the company. At any time, employees can submit dots, or observations—they assess peers, leaders, or subordinates on the metrics and give short explanations of what they’ve observed. The baseball cards create a “pointillist picture” of staff members, aggregating across review cycles and dots, and incorporate various assessments that employees take. The cards’ display changes over time, revealing who’s best suited to play each position, and flagging areas to “rely on” and “watch out for” with green and red lights.</p>
<p>When you express an opinion, it’s weighted by whether you’ve established yourself as believable on that dimension. Your believability is a probability of being right in the present, and is based on your judgment, reasoning, and behavior in the past. In presenting your views, you’re expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts, and you’re not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn’t have an opinion in the first place; you’re supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you’re expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright about it—but know that your colleagues will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you’re supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time. As management scholar Karl Weick advises, “Argue like you’re right and listen like you’re wrong.”-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens, though, when believable people don’t agree? In the summer of 2014, Bridgewater conducted an anonymous survey to find out about dissent that hadn’t been voiced. When co-CEO Greg Jensen led an all-hands meeting to discuss the results, an employee, “Ashley,” commented that some people were misinterpreting Bridgewater’s principles. Greg asked if she was correcting them when that occurred, and Ashley mentioned that she had recently called someone out for a misinterpretation.</p>
<p>By speaking up, Ashley was exemplifying one of Bridgewater’s principles. But rather than responding to the substance of her comment, Greg called her out for violating another Bridgewater principle, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between the forest and the trees, and navigating between the two. He wanted a synthesis of how she handled such situations in general, not her account of a specific case.</p>
<p>A senior manager, Trina Soske, felt that Greg made a bad leadership decision. Although he was attempting to adhere to one Bridgewater principle, Trina was concerned that Ashley—and others—might be discouraged from speaking up in the future. In most organizations, since Greg had higher status than her, a manager in Trina’s position would remain silent and go home thinking he was a jerk. But Trina wrote honest feedback for the whole company to read. She praised Ashley for having the courage and integrity to speak up, and cautioned Greg that his response “signaled the exact opposite of what you, as a CEO, should model.”</p>
<p>In a typical organization, as the senior leader Greg’s opinion would prevail over Trina’s, and her career might be in jeopardy for criticizing him. But at Bridgewater, Trina wasn’t punished, and the resolution wasn’t based on authority, seniority, majority, or who spoke the most loudly or forcefully. It started with a debate via email: Greg disagreed with Trina’s views, as he felt he was being open and direct; after all, principle three stated that no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up. But Trina had heard two different people criticize Greg’s behavior in informal conversations. “The dampening impact is going to be more about what you don’t see and don’t hear,” she wrote to him. She worried that Greg’s behavior would instigate groupthink, causing people to stay silent rather than to challenge leaders. Greg stood his ground: By allowing people to talk behind his back, Trina was failing to hold people accountable for confronting him with their critical opinions. She was allowing them to violate one of Bridgewater’s principles by acting like “slimy weasels.”</p>
<p>It’s extremely rare to see a senior leader open to this kind of thoughtful disagreement, but even more unusual was what Greg did next. “I doubt we’ll be able to resolve this ourselves,” he wrote to Trina, copying the entire management committee—a group of people who had established their believability as leaders. “It’s like agreeing on a judge or a mediator,” Dalio explains. By escalating the disagreement to them, Greg was allowing the idea meritocracy to sort out who was right.</p>
<p>Instead of leaving it to the management committee to resolve, though, Dalio asked Greg and Trina to collaborate on turning their conflict into a case to share with all of Bridgewater. Along with making their debate transtransparent, it forced them to inquire about each other’s perspectives instead of just advocating for their own viewpoints. When the case was finished, to continue the inquiry process Greg and Trina each generated questions to ask the entire company.</p>
<p>Several months after the issue first occurred, it was still being discussed, and the analytics team was preparing to share the data on employees’ reactions. But “resolving the issue itself is in some ways less important than understanding the path to resolving such things in the future, and agreeing on that,” Zack Wieder explains. “No one (including our CEO) has any monopoly on the truth.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not just Dalio’s openness that makes people comfortable challenging senior leaders. It’s the fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced, Bridgewater reveals that we can start encouraging originality on day one. In most organizations, the socialization period is passive: We’re busy learning the ropes and familiarizing ourselves with the culture. By the time we’re up to speed, we’re already swamped with work and beginning to see the world in the company way. The early period is the perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A principle is just some type of event happening over and over again, and how to deal with that event. Life consists of billions of these events, and if you can go from those billions to 250, you can make the connection, ‘Ah, this is one of those ’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he explained that he favored the debate format between believable people, because it was the fastest way to reach the right answer and it enabled them to learn from each other’s reasoning. He had been testing out different cultural practices at Bridgewater for years, and although they’re not controlled experiments, he felt he’d seen enough to have a good sense of what works. He believes that thoughtful disagreement between experts creates an efficient marketplace of ideas, where the best ones emerge over time.</p>
<p>this is my feeling in a nutshell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>driven and imaginative, but I was intrigued by three other qualities on Dalio’s list. “Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear of failing.</p>
<p>Dalio himself fits this description, and the hurdle facing him now is to find another shaper to fill his shoes. If he doesn’t, Bridgewater may vanish like Polaroid’s instant pictures. But Dalio knows that preventing groupthink is about more than the vision of a single leader. The greatest shapers don’t stop at introducing originality into the world. They create cultures that unleash originality in others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>an illustration of why we have and must use diverse capabilities at different times</em></p>
<p>When we’re not yet committed to a particular action, thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous. Since we don’t have our hearts set on charging ahead, envisioning a dismal failure will only activate anxiety, triggering the stop system and slamming our brakes. By looking on the bright side, we’ll activate enthusiasm and turn on the go system.</p>
<p>But once we’ve settled on a course of action, when anxieties creep in, it’s better to think like a defensive pessimist and confront them directly. In this case instead of attempting to turn worries and doubts into positive emotions, we can shift the go system into higher gear by embracing our fear. Since we’ve set our minds to press forward, envisioning the worst-case scenario enables us to harness anxiety as a source of motivation to prepare and succeed. Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more terrifying than the negative. As Julie Norem describes it, once people have imagined the worst, “they feel more in control. In some sense, they’ve peaked in anxiety before their actual performance. By the time they get to the event itself they’ve taken care of almost everything.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>fighting pluralistic ignorance</em></p>
<p>When Popovic trained the Egyptian activists, he shared a story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike, they issued a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon, pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars and trucks at a glacial pace. In his inspiring book Blueprint for Revolution, Popovic explains that prior to these activities:</p>
<p>People were afraid to talk openly about despising Pinochet, so if you hated the dictator, you might have imagined that you were the only one. Tactics like these, Chileans used to say, made people realize that “we are the many and they are the few.” And the beauty was that there was no risk involved: Not even in North Korea was it illegal for cars to drive slowly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Popovic sees a role for amusement wherever fear runs rampant. Instead of trying to decelerate the stop system, he uses laughter to rev up the go system. When you have no power, it’s a powerful way to convert strong negative emotions into positive ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want people to modify their behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing? According to Peter Salovey, one of the originators of the concept of emotional intelligence and now the president of Yale, it depends on whether they perceive the new behavior as safe or risky. If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it—they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. They’re already comfortable with the status quo, so the benefits of change aren’t attractive, and the stop system kicks in. Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and accentuate the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. The prospect of a certain loss brings the go system online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>this is the beauty of the plague inc “destroy” model</em></p>
<p>This “kill the company” exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain-framed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating about innovation opportunities, the leaders weren’t inclined to take risks. When they considered how their competitors could put them out of business, they realized that it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation was apparent.</p>
<p>To counter apathy, most change agents focus on presenting an inspiring vision of the future. This is an important message to convey, but it’s not the type of communication that should come first. If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with the present. To drive people out of their comfort zones, you have to cultivate dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger at the current state of affairs, making it a guaranteed loss. “The greatest communicators of all time,” says communication expert Nancy Duarte—who has spent her career studying the shape of superb presentations—start by establishing “what is: here’s the status quo.” Then, they “compare that to what could be,” making “that gap as big as possible.”</p>

<ul>
<li>This retrospective investigation examined the association among childhood bullying victimization, multiple forms of victimization, and psychological functioning in a college sample. Four hundred-and-eighty-two undergraduate students participated in the study (M = 19.98 years, SD = 1.82). The sample included 65 % women. For race/ethnicity, 66.4 % were European-American (N = 320), 16.8 % African-American (N = 81). For grade level, 21.6 % were freshmen (N = 104), followed by 38.2 % sophomores (N = 184), 16.2 % juniors (N = 78), and 23.4 % seniors (N = 113). Participants completed a survey packet of measures assessing childhood bullying victimization experiences and current levels of psychological functioning. Findings indicated that bullying victimization significantly predicted greater levels of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS) after controlling for other childhood victimization experiences. PTS symptoms were predicted by exposure to community violence and child abuse with bullying victimization was found to be the strongest predictor. College-level practitioners need to assess for a wide range of childhood victimization experiences, including bullying victimization.</li>

<p><em>abusive supervision and employee deviance: a multifoci justice perspective</em><br />
haesang park et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>In order to address the influence of unethical leader behaviors in the form of abusive supervision on subordinates’ retaliatory responses, we meta-analytically examined the impact of abusive supervision on subordinate deviance, inclusive of the role of justice and power distance. Specifically, we investigated the mediating role of supervisory- and organizationally focused justice and the moderating role of power distance as one model explaining why and when abusive supervision is related to subordinate deviance toward supervisors and organizations. With 79 independent sample studies (<em>N</em> = 22,021), we found that abusive supervision was more strongly related to supervisory-focused justice, compared to organizationally focused justice perceptions, and both types of justice perceptions were related to target-similar deviance (deviance toward the supervisor and organization, respectively). Finally, our results showed that the negative implications of abusive supervision were stronger in lower power distance cultures compared to higher power distance cultures.</li>

<p><em>altruistic punishment does not increase with the severity of norm violations in the field</em><br />

<li>The degree of human cooperation among strangers is a major evolutionary puzzle. A prominent explanation is that cooperation is maintained because many individuals have a predisposition to punish those violating group-beneficial norms. A critical condition for cooperation to evolve in evolutionary models is that punishment increases with the severity of the violation. Here we present evidence from a field experiment with real-life interactions that, unlike in lab experiments, altruistic punishment does not increase with the severity of the violation, regardless of whether it is direct (confronting a violator) or indirect (withholding help). We also document growing concerns for counter-punishment as the severity of the violation increases, indicating that the marginal cost of direct punishment increases with the severity of violations. The evidence suggests that altruistic punishment may not provide appropriate incentives to deter large violations. Our findings thus offer a rationale for the emergence of formal institutions for promoting large-scale cooperation among strangers.</li>

It may be too late for you but we will not put up with your behaviour. You are embodying all that can go wrong with society. You feel entitled to take things which are not yours, to steal and rob others of their opportunities for your own gain. You are a banker stealing from hardworking people their hard–earned livelihoods and destroying their lives for your fun. You are a manipulative individual who tries to brainwash others to believe your lies. Well, we will not tolerate you here. There is no place in this society for selfish bastards. If you can't help others you should go away. You've driven away so many nice people because of your abusive behaviour, so you feel lonely and worthless. But just because you made yourself worthless and lonely doesn't make it right to hurt others. Someone has to stand up to you and your abuse. Someone has to say that's enough. Someone has to say that what you do is wrong. And you, you have to understand that or you have no place in this society.<br />
We have to stand up to you, because otherwise you will think you can do what you want and abuse more people. You must stop. If you can't stop yourself then society will stop you.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>04517</h2>
<ul>
<li>why try to understand abuse?
<ul>
<li>maybe because I've had to deal with this my whole life that is why I really detest it.</li>
<li>I know I really hate it when people abuse others. I know they have their own problems but that does not mean it is okay for them to behave this way.</li>
<li>why is what abusive people do an interesting thing to study? it is just one way of understanding how responsibility and trust can be abused. when we understand some of the techniques abusive people use, we can better protect ourselves and show others how to protect themselves. it also can be a way to avoid following that path in our own behaviour. but it is equally important to study what responsible people do. the interesting thing there is being able to spot a responsible person! we might ask for example, how can we know who is responsible? is it possible because we are already are or understand what responsibility is ourselves? the thing is not to get too caught up on that kind of question because it is circular and a little misleading. we define responsibility in our language so that it means a certain type of behaviour.</li>

<h2>04417</h2>

<li>hierarchy awareness
<ul>
<li>we have need of being aware of what kind of people are in the hierarchy. if they are responsible, we want to be with them and learn from them. we know they will appreciate our talents and help us.</li>
<li>but if the people in the hierarchy are abusive and irresponsible, they will be jealous of our success and act as obstacles to responsible behaviour. sometimes we can choose to be with a responsible person rather than an abusive one, but sometimes we don't get to choose. in that situation we need to make the best of it and get out as soon as we can. unfortunately abusive people need to be open to change before they can behave responsibly and we cannot wait and hope that will happen while we are there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>i am unimpressed by riches, status or power. what impresses me is responsible people. the rich or powerful are not more responsible because of their position; in their behaviour they are just the same as everyone — there are people who behave irresponsibly, and abuse others and themselves, and there are people who behave responsibly, caring for others and themselves.</li>

<ul>
<li>in a gang, like any other longstanding organisation, there must be some factors keeping it together. with a gang, this might be the leader, but is often someone else, a sly, devious type, who controls and manipulates an leader who has integrity and honour (although his actions outside of the gang would speak otherwise, within the gang he provides a binding force)
<ul>
<li>since the sly devious one cannot maintain a group by himself, he makes or finds a group on which to prey. the key to dissolving gangs is to stop and divert these devious ones from the path they perhaps unwittingly chose.</li>

<li>the tragedy of the commons is a problem with no solution, literally. because garrett hardin defines commons as a place where all can do anything without restriction or responsibility. thus it is not surprising that he finds that what will happen in such a place is exactly as he defines it.</li>
<li>all refuted yet the paper resonates because it has some truth. people are using the earth as a commons not because they rationally justify it to themselves, but because they wish not to understand that they should act differently. the form of why they should act differently is given by hardin as coercion.</li>
<li>extractive relations rather than sharing relations may be what lead to tragedy of commons in the first place. instead of believing good will come back, we create the bad with each extraction and exploitation.</li>

<ul>
<li>often precisely because they wish to manipulate us, to hide something from us, that is why they label something as bad or unacceptable — when in reality everything has some useful, essential purpose even if we don’t understand what it is.</li>
<li>the abusers start from a deliberate abusive interpretation of darwin’s theory of evolution; that it is individual competition that determines who ‘wins’ in life, rather than the reality that random chance circumstances matter much more for survival and thriving of entire populations, and thus has the greater influence on whether an individual gets a chance to ‘win’ at all.</li>
<li>abusers understand this, to some degree, which is why they seek to manipulate others for their own ends by perpetuating their abusive interpretation of evolution and competition — giving themselves that chance to ‘win’ by depriving others of their livelihoods and futures.</li>

<ul>
<li>the problem is those people who have taken power who will not understand in time. what is to be done about them?</li>
<li>to believe only that awareness will solve is naive.</li>
<li>in a way the situation will resolve itself. if we do nothing, the system will collapse of its own accord. and there will be great suffering. but if we wish to lessen suffering, what can we do?</li>
<li>first of all we must eliminate violent reactions. killing or punishment has never solved the world's problems and never will. we are not asking people to abandon anger and hatred of abuse, we just ask that the anger and hatred be directed only at abusive behaviour rather than at abusive people.</li>
<li>now there will still be people who believe in violent means, and despite what we say or do they will be violent. in this they become the same as the violent oppressors and perpetuate the cycle of oppression no matter how noble their intention.</li>
<li>yes we are in fact calling for a world-wide enlightenment, even though we know some people will not make it in time. and it may be true that this may not change the world enough to avoid catastrophe. jared diamond in his book, collapse, was not saying the whole story of the easter islanders who destroyed their own island home and civilisation. it was not necessary for the last generation to be abusive. it was only necessary for the last-but-one generation to do so, and the fate of the civilisation had been decided.</li>
<li>we are not the last generation of this civilisation, but we may very well be the last-but-one. we bear the burdens of our ancestors and it may be too great a burden to lift. but we bear too the hope of those to come, and that is something worth living for.</li>

<h2>03417</h2>
<ul>
<li>human arrogance is what I call the ability of humans to dismiss others. to believe that they are correct and to believe that if others cannot convince them otherwise then they need do nothing.
<ul>
<li>by that measure Cambridge is full of arrogant people.</li>
<li>We dislike arrogance because it shows a person is not willing to learn at that time. This may be the major problem with our time. Even though the now–massive problems that need to be solved require a now–massive effort from all of us to learn, understand, and deal with the problem, there are currently some people who don't want to learn. In all ages they are present but in the current one some of them hold influence and power and still refuse to move.<br />
This is the reason that concentration of power is bad, because it multiplies the effect of people acting irresponsibly.<br />
The reason religion can become bad is because by definition, religion is regarded as the highest authority. Religious abusers believe that the rules of human society do not apply to them, because they obey a higher law, that which is revealed to them in their religion. This would be okay if the higher law was still true, but unfortunately an unchanging higher law becomes false very quickly, and the higher law then becomes a tool for abusing others.<br />
After four thousand years of transcription I wouldn't wonder if even the best message gets distorted. We can't lay blame at the feet of a few religions. Can we really expect that nothing would have happened in the meantime? If not this, then something else would have happened.<br />
So what should we do? Think for ourselves and depend less on authority.</li>

<h2>03317</h2>
<ul>
<li>why do so many people want to be right? because there is a spell which binds them to believe that to be worthy, they must be right.
<ul>
<li>i hate being right, because they believed that if they admitted I was right, then they would be shown to be wrong, and that this would be bad. why did they think being right was so important?</li>
<li>self protection from remorse: if someone spends many years doing something, and believed that they needed to deliberately sacrifice in order to do this, would it not be devastating to face the possibility that all they did was for naught, or resulted in furthering someone else's ends rather than their own, or even badly abused others for the sake of selfish, irresponsible reasons?</li>
<li>self protection for status: in that culture, it was taught that to be right was to be good, and to be wrong was evil –– if you admitted you were wrong, or that you could be or had been wrong, it was implied that you would always be wrong, and even that you were evil and must be cast out and despised. why was this taught? because it was the mechanism used to abuse power. by inculcating this in people, the abusers maintained they were right and good and to be given power, and thus that their opponents were wrong and evil and must be killed. the people were to believe this to be true, to be correct, to be right; for to doubt, or question, or believe otherwise was wrong, evil, and deserving of retribution.</li>
<li>so the system of ethics in a culture, maintained by a society, can enable abusive people to take power away from others, withhold and wield it. this is why understanding of ethics is practical, if one wishes to wield power responsibly, and to fight abuse.</li>
<li>interestingly, to accept responsibility is to also accept that one has power. is this because responsibility is the name for what we expect when power is given –– that the receiver is to use the power for responsible acts?</li>

<h2>02717</h2>
<ul>
<li>there are those who believe that having understood a part of reality, they are entitled to exploit those that do not understand. is this the basic moral failing? where someone with a temporary advantage uses it to gain continued advantage?

<h2>02617</h2>
<ul>
<li>with beauty and power too, the privileged are more often irresponsible in their behaviour. it is often interesting to see how people behave towards you when they believe you are not as privileged as they are.</li>
<li>just because people who are are the most abusive happen to be also privileged, does not mean that privileged people are all abusive. to do so would be as nonsensical as saying people who are most abusive happen to be also alive, therefore living people are all abusive. while it is literally true that all people are abusive, the useful information becomes corrupted when abusive people claim that any particular group is more abusive than any other — in reality, no group is more abusive than any other, we are all abusive because we are all deluded. the difficulty with people who are both abusive and privileged is not that they are privileged, but that privilege in most forms leads to, derives from, and is sustained by concentration of power, and it is concentration of power that magnifies the effect of each person’s inherent abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02517</h2>
<ul>
<li>people do not intend to become abusive. people slowly build up bad habits and attitudes that lead to worse things. the same is true of good things however.
<ul>
<li>It is not that people are evil; even well–meaning people do harm when they don't try to understand what they do. It isn't their prejudice or your difference from them, it is a lack of care that is innate because they are not ready.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there may be no such thing as truth, but there are many lies. you can tell how abusive someone is by how much they lie.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02417</h2>
<ul>
<li>the concept of selfishness can be misleading, because it implies that people intend to be selfish — but perhaps most people who act selfishly, who act abusively, do not, for whatever reason, currently have the ability to think how their actions affect others.
<ul>
<li>It may be, that in the human evolutionary past, that selfishness served a useful purpose — rather than being abusive. Our response to threats and scarcity may have been adaptive, on a small scale in dire emergencies and even then the effect was limited by the small reach of humans. But to speculate on this may not be worthwhile, as there might not be an answer to find. What we need to deal with is the huge abusive effect that our human selfishness causes now in the world, because our cumulative impact is now so massive.</li>

<li>because people trap themselves in their circumstances, they feel they cannot escape and feel as if they have no options. to make themselves feel better, some may use others, perhaps unkindly.

<li>for some abusers, the reason for gaining power is to cause chaos. they wish to disable the working and growth of civilisation for the gain of abusers waiting to take advantage of the chaos.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01717</h2>
<ul>
<li>so basically the problems in the world come down to the same thing. how do we deal with a person who behaves abusively, and they are our supposed guardians, our partners, and ourselves?
<ul>
<li>and the corollary is how do we live, purposefully, joyfully, compassionately?</li>
<li>it is no use telling an abuser that they are an abuser, that what they are doing is wrong. if they could act otherwise, they would already have done so. all we can do is wait and hope that one day they will change, and in the meantime try to reduce the damage they do.</li>

<p>once, a long time ago, they too loved, but they lost it.<br />
is it our response to that inevitable loss that determines our individual fates?</p>
<ul>
<li>what the abusers can never have is true love and friendship</li>
<li>power as destroyer. people who forget how to create can only destroy. their lives are empty of real love and connection, not because no one would love them, but because they can no longer accept love.</li>
<li>abusers are those who were, possibly through no fault of their own, unable to deal with the abuse they faced as children</li>
<li>people are so disappointed by the abuse they face in the world, that the become hardened and perpetuate the poison that destroyed them</li>
<li>abusive people fear loneliness. they fear it so much it consumes them. yet others, even though they may not understand why they do so, draw away and are disgusted by the abusive person's destructive behaviour — it is in the consciousness of our species to do so, because we know abuse should be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01517</h2>
<ul>
<li>all the so–called sins arise from fear, just as fear arises from separation from reality. rather than ignorance, it is both not knowing and not dealing with what cannot be known that leads to separation from reality.
<ul>
<li>hate comes from fear, and fear comes from abuse.</li>
<li>abusers, bullies, aggressors, why do they not change for the better? they fear what change would bring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01417</h2>
<ul>
<li>how do situations arise and how do we perpetuate them? how do abusers manage to continue their abuse, when the people they abuse (one would initially think) could escape?
<ul>
<li>it may be that the differing models of behaviour, fearful and trusting, are suitable to different societal conditions, i.e. chaos and order. the mechanisms abusive people use to perpetuate a condition that is fruitful (at least in the short term) for them but inimical to others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01317</h2>
<ul>
<li>given that people do behave abusively sometimes, and some more often and more deeply than we can bear at that time, how do we comport ourselves? when we meet more people, the proportion of abusive actions we encounter may stay the &quot;same&quot; but the effect on us may be disproportionately large – it is not proportions of abuse but abuse itself that affects us. also, abuse can be very deep and extreme, even life–threatening. how do we deal with this? it is tempting to withdraw, just to not expose ourselves to those people acting abusively. however, this way can never, by definition, lead to a responsible society. we can build shields and weapons against abuse, but these can lead to problems too – general loss of sensitivity instead of specific protection against abuse, weapons readied and used when inappropriate and unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01217</h2>
<ul>
<li>those who would abuse us, who would use us for their own ends.</li>
<li>they use our own instincts against us.
<ul>
<li>abuse is revolting: visceral response to abuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>they tell us to seek salvation out there, when salvation can only come from within each of us.</li>
<li>whether it is virtue, or goodness, or love, or beauty, or knowledge, or money, whatever is most valued, the abuser seeks to create a scarcity, a monopoly, so that they can gain power over others.</li>
<li>abusive people accrete power by destroying the ability of others to defend themselves. in so doing, they make their own downfall a certainty.</li>

<li>what kind of society makes monsters that turn orphaned, powerless, vulnerable children into abused slaves, sexual objects, living weapons?
<ul>
<li>the society we build every day with our own two hands — if we let the powerful rape and pillage the powerless — if we let society make abusers powerful</li>
<li>it is abuse to “sacrifice the few to save the many” — the answer is in not making a society that asks us to do this, where the rich and powerful take so much that the poor and powerless must fight each other just to live</li>
<li>each and every one of us is part of the problem — and part of the solution</li>

<ul>
<li>a sane person might wonder, “why would any person set out to become an abusive person?” and indeed, much of what contributes to how a person becomes abusive is plain chance occurrence: who they meet in life and other encounters along the way. but there are active poisoners, those who seek to destroy people and the fabric of society for no reason — they have become completely abusive, and likely can no longer change for the better. they coerce and force others to become abusive like them, through mental abuse like brainwashing. it is like a zombie plague where the poisonous, sickening bite from one turns the next into the same.</li>
<li>they don't want you to learn, because questioning the belief they have infected you with is the only way to destroy their power over us all.</li>
<li>where they seek to bind you, whether with hate or love or things or freedom — it is still binding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00817</h2>
<ul>
<li>capacity for review
<ul>
<li>could it be that too much self–absorption is the root cause? when we are so concerned with our selves that we neglect the effect of our actions on others, and take offence at others' actions because they are not ideal for us, then we start to become more irresponsible and abusive.</li>
<li>is this why power corrupts, because we lose our capacity to review our actions, when we remove those who would point out we are no longer right?</li>
<li>they only test their information once, if at all. we need to examine our beliefs and concepts often if we want to live closer to reality.</li>
<li>when do people lose the urge to better themselves?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00717</h2>
<ul>
<li>concentration of power
<ul>
<li>The human military, like its science or religion or politics, is a tool which human society uses to perpetuate itself. These tools, like human society and civilisation, are not abusive because we can see what they do, but because the concentration of power, in almost any form, is a poison.</li>
<li>The single most salient aid to the concentrated abuse of power in recent history is fossil fuels. As fossil fuels become scarce, the abusers who are not ignorant of processes become desperate in their bid to cling to power. They turn to war and oppression and manipulation.</li>
<li>that there are people who would taint baby milk formula with poison is both horrible and inevitable, but it doesn’t mean we cannot do anything. sadly we are all in the position of poisoning the world of future generations, through our use of chemicals and fossil fuels and nuclear, through war and industry and technology — but like those who taint baby milk, we deny that destroying the future is wrong, as we do not truly understand what we do.</li>
<li>problem of weapons and dangerous tools is when people forget the danger — then there is little safeguard from tragedy. this is true in general of society, and is the great tragedy of civilisation</li>
<li>the idea of the division of labour leads to institutions and concentration of power. not all bad, even if does often seem so.</li>
<li>used to be mainly concentration via slavery, now it is concentration via fossil fuels and slavery. both have consequences.</li>
<li>preparing for aging
<ul>
<li>our ability and chance of doing harm increases as we get older, and is less balanced by future potential to do good. this is simply how concentration of power and limited life and cognitive abilities turn out.</li>
<li>unlike becoming different sexes or races, many (not all) of us will have the chance to grow old, so we should prepare for this eventuality — though today in common with other eventualities, most people are not able to prepare for their own aging</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00617</h2>
<ul>
<li>three questions; firstly, what is truly responsible behaviour — what is virtue, and process of understanding knowledge. secondly, how do we change our own behaviour now we understand our own behaviour is not virtuous, and that of others — process of reflection and communiation. finally, how do we behave now we understand that there will always be processes beyond our present understanding — process of evolution and diversity.</li>
<li>limits of abilities
<ul>
<li>they have reached the limits of their abilities, and that is okay. everyone is different and has different parts to play in life. you must take care of your physical and mental well–being when they are no longer capable of understanding that their behaviour has become abusive.</li>
<li>it is simply harder for us to understand that which we do not experience — that is the nature of it. if we wish to understand we must experience it somehow, whether by accident, intention, imagination. for people who live without experiencing a wide range of things may seem narrower–minded compared to the rest of us, and more prone to abusive behaviour.</li>
<li>is the inability or lack of adequate ability to understand consequences of our behaviour a major factor in why humans act abusively?</li>
<li>and the different kinds of abuser acting concurrently that make the situation seem intractable? if so would it be an advantage to identify the major types of abuser?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00517</h2>
<ul>
<li>sustaining myths
<ul>
<li>abusers use a twisted version of Darwin’s theory of evolution to justify and promote their abuse and suppression of people — they say, “if we do not keep the plebs at bay, we, the chosen, shall be overrun”.</li>
<li>competition is mischaracterised; neither red in tooth and claw (predator—prey) nor harem (stags, silverbacks) are generally true. rather than predator–prey, is symbiosis. rather than harem, is mate choice. in both is diversity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00417</h2>
<ul>
<li>abuse, is, at heart, the inability to reconcile our inner representation of reality — with reality as it truly is.
<ul>
<li>
<p>because reality changes, we must change our inner representations of it to match. the problem comes when we no longer do so. this is why change, and momentum — the flow of change — are such essential ideas and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pride is a limitation for learning.<br />
An unprepared enemy can still overwhelm you.<br />
Pride and sloth are addictions, excuses not to face reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sadly, all fixed belief systems are likely to be, or become abusive. they set people and the world up for failure, because they cannot even nearly represent reality</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00317</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all people blind to (truly unaware of) our own mistakes — otherwise why would we still be making them? but essential difference is our current awareness of this something–of–which–we–cannot–be–aware, and what we do about it.</p>
<p>we might argue that we know what needs to be done, or that circumstances are beyond our control, but the question simply becomes: why do we not act to change our lives for the better?</p>
<ul>
<li>we unintentionally act harmfully, and this will always be true. but we can learn to do better, and try to repair the harm we cause</li>
<li>all people are abusers, some deny it is so</li>
<li>what is it like to understand that without constant vigilance and massive effort on your part, and a whole lot of luck which you may not get, that you will end up being as abusive as the previous generation, and all those that came before them?</li>
<li>people often believe that what they are doing is responsible, even if in fact it is abusive. so sometimes it takes an extraordinary turn of events before people are willing and ready to re–examine how we live our lives.</li>
<li>we all have moral failings. those that think they do not are delusional. but that does not mean we should not work at resolving our failings, making them into successes.</li>
<li>so many people have the chance to change their own habits, the habits that are killing themselves and others. in whose interest is it that this process continues, that we keep killing ourselves?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00217</h2>
<ul>
<li>but it is an illusion, too, that we choose whether we become abusive. it is chance circumstance that leads us to where we are today, perhaps able to live more responsibly, but also perhaps abusively.</li>
<li>is the response of abusive behaviour to abusive behaviour adaptive simply because in the absence of other learning, it is an aid to survival? in other words, in a better situation where we know, understand, and can use different responses that are not abusive, these are more adaptive — the issue being that we do not always have access to such responses without lucky circumstance or training</li>
</ul>
<h2>00117</h2>
<ul>
<li>what we call abusive is an excessive misunderstanding of reality, with harsh practical consequences. people acting abusively are best avoided, though occasionally they should be approached to try to break their curse, most likely they will have to break it themselves, if they ever do.</li>
<li>when someone I know is abusive to me, I do not wish to react by abusing them back. but by withdrawing my active cooperation, effectively i do so. I try to make sure that their behaviour was not misinterpreted, or by chance, and to review it in future in case they change. although I believe that nobody is abusive if we could be otherwise than abusive at that moment, there is no immutable judgement, it is practical to take action to avoid further abuse, given that they are at that moment unlikely to change their abusive behaviour. but even then, like most people, I tend to wait too long to do this, and suffer through much abuse, while trying without success to change their abusive behaviour. the ultimate answer may be that we can only really change our own behaviour, so that to work on changing my own beliefs and habits may be only way forward for each and every one of us, because we are only able to truly accept external input at unpredictable times.</li>
<li>have you ever wondered why our world is the way it is? we all contribute to our culture, this culture which is sick and abusive — and we are all abusive, no matter whether we believe so or not — yet we can also cherish and flourish too. in religious shorthand, “we all sin, yet we all redeem”, in secular shorthand, “we all abuse, and nevertheless also cherish”.</li>
<li>no matter whether our abuse is intended or unintended, it is still abuse. The only way to change this is if we ourselves continue to change and grow and adapt to reality. Unfortunately, almost our entire culture and civilisation works against this. We must find not only what reality is, and how it changes and grows, and how to flourish, but do so almost despite our culture and civilisation.</li>
<li>we are all abusers in some way, the only difference is between those who are still trying to do better than they have done, and those who no longer try.
<ul>
<li>so–called evil is never far away, as it is unceased abuse, and every one of us, due to the constant change of reality and our relatively slow ability to adapt to it, creates abuse. This abuse that we all perpetuate each day, and the abuse perpetuated by demagogues and extremists, is not so different as we are led to believe.</li>
<li>Happily, the process of solving this is also much easier than we are led to believe. Learning to face reality and grow with it is no small thing, but it is not only possible, but also is doable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>people do not want to believe that our behaviour, at root, has no rational basis; that ultimately our behaviour is as if it were controlled by spells that were cast by a fairy godmother. in refusing to examine the root of our behaviour, it becomes only a rare chance occurrence that we can change our behaviour to deal with changing circumstances.</li>
