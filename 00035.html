<p><em>quantifying the sexual afterglow</em><br />
andrea l. meltzer, anastasia makhanova, lindsey l. hicks, juliana e. french, james k. mcnulty, thomas n. bradbury 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617691361">dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617691361</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Sex presumably facilitates pair bonding, but how do partners remain pair-bonded between sexual acts? Evolutionary perspectives suggest that sexual afterglow serves this purpose. We explored how long sexual satisfaction would remain elevated following sex and predicted that stronger sexual afterglow would characterize more satisfying partnerships. We pooled the data from two independent, longitudinal studies of newlywed couples to examine these issues. Spouses reported their daily sexual activity and sexual satisfaction for 14 days and their marital satisfaction at baseline and 4 or 6 months later. Results demonstrated that sexual satisfaction remained elevated approximately 48 hr after sex, and spouses experiencing a stronger afterglow reported higher levels of marital satisfaction both at baseline and over time. We interpret these findings as evidence that sexual afterglow is a proximal cognitive mechanism through which sex promotes pair bonding.</li>
<li>these findings highlight the importance of the duration of interpersonal experiences for interpersonal well-being. To date, most research on human social relationships has examined the immediate and long-term implications of discrete psychological experiences. For example, rejection (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, &amp; Schaller, 2007), praise (Flora &amp; Segrin, 2000), forgiveness (McNulty, 2008), and apology (Luchies, Finkel, McNulty, &amp; Kumashiro, 2010) all have measurable effects on relationships, but the current work suggests that the duration of such experiences—that is, the length of their aftermath—is an additional factor worth examin- ing in its own right; how long people remain happy fol- lowing a compliment, angry following a fight, or motivated following a setback likely has important impli- cations for interpersonal well-being that have been largely unexplored to date.</li>

<p><em>post sex affectionate exchanges promote sexual and relationship satisfaction</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The current research examined the role of post sex affection in promoting sexual and relationship satisfaction in ongoing romantic partnerships. Since romantic partners view the period after engaging in sex as an important time for bonding and intimacy, we sought to determine if and how the duration and quality of post sex affection might promote satisfaction in romantic relationships. In two studies, we tested the link between post sex affectionate behavior (e.g., cuddling, caressing, shared intimacy) and sexual and relationship satisfaction. In Study 1, a cross-sectional survey of individuals in romantic relationships (<em>N</em> = 335), duration of post sex affection was associated with higher sexual satisfaction and, in turn, higher relationship satisfaction. In Study 2, a daily experience study of 101 established couples (<em>N</em> = 202) with a 3-month follow-up, day-to-day changes in post sex affection duration and quality were associated with both partners’ sexual and relationship satisfaction, and engaging in longer and more satisfying post sex affection over the course of the study was associated with higher relationship and sexual satisfaction 3 months later. In general, the pattern of results was consistent for men and women, but the association between the duration of post sex affection and relationship satisfaction was stronger for women than for men (Study 1) and women, but not men, felt more sexually satisfied when their partner reported higher quality post sex affection (Study 2). The findings suggest that the period after sex is a critical time for promoting satisfaction in intimate bonds.</li>

<p><em>what is orgasm? a model of sexual trance and climax via rhythmic entrainment</em><br />
adam safron 2016</p>
<p><a href="http://www.socioaffectiveneuroscipsychol.net/index.php/snp/article/view/31763">31763</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Orgasm is one of the most intense pleasures attainable to an organism, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. On the basis of existing literatures, this article introduces a novel mechanistic model of sexual stimulation and orgasm. In doing so, it characterizes the neurophenomenology of sexual trance and climax, describes parallels in dynamics between orgasms and seizures, speculates on possible evolutionary origins of sex differences in orgasmic responding, and proposes avenues for future experimentation. Here, a model is introduced wherein sexual stimulation induces entrainment of coupling mechanical and neuronal oscillatory systems, thus creating synchronized functional networks within which multiple positive feedback processes intersect synergistically to contribute to sexual experience. These processes generate states of deepening sensory absorption and trance, potentially culminating in climax if critical thresholds are surpassed. The centrality of rhythmic stimulation (and its modulation by salience) for surpassing these thresholds suggests ways in which differential orgasmic responding between individuals—or with different partners—may serve as a mechanism for ensuring adaptive mate choice. Because the production of rhythmic stimulation combines honest indicators of fitness with cues relating to potential for investment, differential orgasmic response may serve to influence the probability of continued sexual encounters with specific mates.</li>

<p><em>differences in orgasm frequency among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual men and women in a u.s. national sample</em><br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-017-0939-z">dx.doi.org/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a notable gap between heterosexual men and women in frequency of orgasm during sex. Little is known, however, about sexual orientation differences in orgasm frequency. We examined how over 30 different traits or behaviors were associated with frequency of orgasm when <em>sexually intimate</em> during the past month. We analyzed a large US sample of adults (<em>N</em> = 52,588) who identified as heterosexual men (<em>n</em> = 26,032), gay men (<em>n</em> = 452), bisexual men (<em>n</em> = 550), lesbian women (<em>n</em> = 340), bisexual women (<em>n</em> = 1112), and heterosexual women (<em>n</em> = 24,102). Heterosexual men were most likely to say they usually-always orgasmed when sexually intimate (95%), followed by gay men (89%), bisexual men (88%), lesbian women (86%), bisexual women (66%), and heterosexual women (65%). Compared to women who orgasmed less frequently, women who orgasmed more frequently were more likely to: receive more oral sex, have longer duration of last sex, be more satisfied with their relationship, ask for what they want in bed, praise their partner for something they did in bed, call/email to tease about doing something sexual, wear sexy lingerie, try new sexual positions, anal stimulation, act out fantasies, incorporate sexy talk, and express love during sex. Women were more likely to orgasm if their last sexual encounter included deep kissing, manual genital stimulation, and/or oral sex in addition to vaginal intercourse. We consider sociocultural and evolutionary explanations for these orgasm gaps. The results suggest a variety of behaviors couples can try to increase orgasm frequency.</li>

<ul>
<li>The current study examined whether directly altering affective associations involving a relationship partner through evaluative conditioning can lead to changes in relationship satisfaction. Married couples (<em>N</em> = 144) were asked to view a brief stream of images once every 3 days for 6 weeks. Embedded in this stream were pictures of the partner, which, according to random assignment of couples to experimental group, were paired with either positive or neutral stimuli. Couples also completed measures of automatic partner attitudes and explicit marital satisfaction at baseline and once every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Spouses who viewed their partners paired with positive stimuli demonstrated more-positive automatic partner attitudes than did control spouses, and these attitudes predicted increased self-reported marital satisfaction over time. These results provide novel evidence for a mechanism of change in relationship satisfaction, represent a step toward documenting how strong attitudes can evolve through passive exposure to information, and suggest novel avenues for relationship interventions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Deciding to embrace challenging opportunities may present one life context through which individuals may thrive, and these decisions may be influenced by one’s significant relationships. Married couples were unobtrusively videotaped as one couple-member was presented with a challenging opportunity and decided whether to accept it. We assessed interpersonal predictors of the decision to accept or forgo the opportunity, predictors of the spouse’s support during decision-making, and follow-up thriving outcomes 6 months later. Results indicated that specific support behaviors enacted by the spouse—relational catalyst (RC) support provision—encouraged decision-makers to accept the challenge and that this decision predicted long-term thriving outcomes for the decision-maker. Results also indicated that the spouse’s support behavior was influenced by both chronic and experimentally manipulated motivations for providing support, and these motives provide pathways by which relationship satisfaction and attachment security predict the provision of RC support. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</li>

<li>Middle adolescents’ close friendship strength and the degree to which their broader peer group expressed a preference to affiliate with them were examined as predictors of relative change in depressive symptoms, self-worth, and social anxiety symptoms from ages 15 to 25 using multimethod, longitudinal data from 169 adolescents. Close friendship strength in midadolescence predicted relative increases in self-worth and decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms by early adulthood. Affiliation preference by the broader peer group, in contrast, predicted <em>higher</em> social anxiety by early adulthood. Results are interpreted as suggesting that adolescents who prioritize forming close friendships are better situated to manage key social developmental tasks going forward than adolescents who prioritize attaining preference with many others in their peer milieu.</li>

<ul>
<li>A practical methodology is presented for creating closeness in an experimental context. Whether or not an individual is in a relationship, particular pairings of individuals in the relationship, and circumstances of relationship development become manipulated variables. Over a 45-min period subject pairs carry out self-disclosure and relationship-building tasks that gradually escalate in intensity. Study 1 found greater postinteraction closeness with these tasks versus comparable small-talk tasks. Studies 2 and 3 found no significant closeness effects, in spite of adequate power for (a) whether pairs were matched for nondisagreement on important attitudes, (b) whether pairs were led to expect mutual liking, or (c) whether getting close was made an explicit goal. These studies also illustrated applications for addressing theoretical issues, yielding provocative tentative findings relating to attachment style and introversion/extraversion.</li>

<p>“Since a person’s self-esteem is, in part, an internal tracking device reflecting self-perceived mate value, these forms of abuse may be functional in mate retention, however morally abhorrent they are.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>men’s benefits came from monopolizing a woman’s reproductive capacity and women’s from monopolizing a man’s investments</p>
<p>women’s preferences for a successful, ambitious, and resource-capable mate coevolved with men’s competitive mating strategies, which include risk taking, status striving, derogation of competitors, coalition formation, and an array of individual efforts aimed at surpassing other men on the dimensions that women desire. The intertwining of these coevolved mechanisms in men and women created the conditions for men to dominate in the domain of resources.<br />
The origins of men’s control over resources is not simply an incidental historical footnote of passing curiosity. Rather, it has a profound bearing on the present, because it reveals some of the primary causes of men’s continuing control of resources. Women today continue to want men who have resources, and they continue to reject men who lack resources.</p>
<p>Men continue to compete with other men to acquire the status and resources that make them desirable to women. The forces that originally caused the resource inequality between the genders—women’s mate preferences and men’s competitive strategies—are the same forces that contribute to maintaining resource inequality today.</p>
<p>men’s efforts to control female sexuality lie at the core of their efforts to control women. Our evolved sexual strategies account for why this occurs, and why control of women’s sexuality is a central preoccupation of men.</p>
<p>Feminist theory sometimes portrays men as being united with all other men in their common purpose of oppressing women.12 But the evolution of human mating suggests that this scenario cannot be true, because men and women compete primarily against members of their own gender. Men strive to control resources mainly at the expense of other men. Men deprive other men of their resources, exclude other men from positions of status and power, and derogate other men in order to make them less desirable to women.</p>
<p>Women do not escape damage inflicted by members of their own sex.14 Women compete with each other for access to high-status men, have sex with other women’s husbands, and lure men away from their wives. Mate poaching is a ubiquitous sexual strategy of our species. Women slander and denigrate their rivals and are especially harsh toward women who pursue short-term sexual strategies. Women and men are both victims of the sexual strategies of their own gender and so can hardly be said to be united with their own gender for some common goal.</p>
<p>Although today men’s sexual strategies contribute to their control over resources, the origins of their strategies cannot be separated from the evolution of women’s desires. This analysis does not imply that we should blame women for the fact that men control resources or blame men for their relentless pursuit of them. Rather, if harmony and equality are to be achieved, women and men both must be recognized as linked together in a spiraling causal chain of this coevolutionary process. This process started long ago with the evolution of desire and continues to operate today through our strategies of mating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jay Belsky and his colleagues, for example, argue that harsh, rejecting, and inconsistent child-rearing practices, erratically provided resources, and marital discord foster in children a mating strategy of early reproduction and rapid turnover. In contrast, sensitive, supportive, and responsive child rearing, combined with reliable resources and spousal harmony, foster in children a mating strategy of commitment marked by delayed reproduction and stable marital bonds. Children growing up in uncertain and unpredictable environments, in short, learn that they cannot rely on a single mate. They therefore opt for a sexual life that starts early and that inclines them to switch mates frequently. In contrast, children who grow up in stable homes with predictably investing parents opt for a strategy of permanent mating because they expect to attract a stable, high-investing mate. The evidence from children of divorced homes supports this theory. Such children reach puberty earlier, engage in intercourse earlier, and have more numerous sex partners than their peers from intact homes.</p>
<p>The fact that conflicts between men and women originate from our evolved mating psychology is disturbing to some people, partly because it contradicts widely held beliefs. Many of us have learned the traditional view that these conflicts are reflections of a particular culture whose practices perturb the natural harmony of human nature. But the anger that women feel when sexually coerced and the rage that men feel when cuckolded arise from our evolved mating strategies, not from capitalism, culture, patriarchy, or socialization.</p>
<p>Among the Yanomamö, there are two key motives that spur men to declare war on another tribe—a desire to capture the wives of other men and a desire to recapture wives that were lost in previous raids. When the American anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon explained to his Yanomamö informants that the United States waged war for principles such as freedom and democracy, they were astonished. It seemed absurd to them to risk one’s life for anything other than capturing or recapturing women.</p>
<p>We are empowered now, more than at any time in human evolutionary history, to shape our future. The fact that deception, coercion, and abuse stem from our mating strategies does not justify their perpetuation. By employing the evolved mechanisms that are sensitive to personal costs, such as our sensitivity to reputational damage and our fear of ostracism, we may be able to curtail the expression of the more damaging aspects of our mating strategies.</p>

<p><em>arching the back (lumbar curvature) as a female sexual proceptivity signal: an eye-tracking study</em> farid pazhoohi et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40806-017-0123-7">dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40806-017-0123-7</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is common in studies of human mate preference to have participants judge the attractiveness of photographs in which models adopt a neutral facial expression or a neutral body posture. However, it is unlikely that humans adopt neutral expressions and postures in normal social circumstances. One way in which posture can vary is in the curvature of the lower spine. In some non-human animals, a “lordotic” posture (in which the lower spine is curved towards the belly) is associated in females with readiness to mate. In humans, this posture may serve a similar function, attracting heterosexual men. In this study, participants were presented with computer-generated images of female bodies in which the back curvature was systematically manipulated. The result showed that small changes in lumbar curvature are associated with changes in the perception of attractiveness. Specifically, the result showed that there is a relationship between the range of the back curvatures used in this study and attractiveness, such that increasing the curvature increased the perception of attractiveness. Additionally, as the curvature increased, participants looked longer and fixated more on the hip region of the female bodies. This paper argues that the attractiveness of women in lordotic posture is due to a conserved mechanism across the taxa which signals proceptivity to men.</li>

<p><em>bonobos respond prosocially toward members of other groups</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Modern humans live in an “exploded” network with unusually large circles of trust that form due to prosociality toward unfamiliar people (i.e. xenophilia). In a set of experiments we demonstrate that semi-free ranging bonobos (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) – both juveniles and young adults – also show spontaneous responses consistent with xenophilia. Bonobos voluntarily aided an unfamiliar, non-group member in obtaining food even when he/she did not make overt requests for help. Bonobos also showed evidence for involuntary, contagious yawning in response to videos of yawning conspecifics who were complete strangers. These experiments reveal that xenophilia in bonobos can be unselfish, proactive and automatic. They support the first impression hypothesis that suggests xenophilia can evolve through individual selection in social species whenever the benefits of building new bonds outweigh the costs. Xenophilia likely evolved in bonobos as the risk of intergroup aggression dissipated and the benefits of bonding between immigrating members increased. Our findings also mean the human potential for xenophilia is either evolutionarily shared or convergent with bonobos and not unique to our species as previously proposed.</li>

<p><em>wealth, poverty, and happiness: social class is differentially associated with positive emotions</em><br />

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000387">http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000387</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Is higher social class associated with greater happiness? In a large nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 1,519), we examined the association between social class (household income) and self-reported tendencies to experience 7 distinct positive emotions that are core to happiness: amusement, awe, compassion, contentment, enthusiasm, love, and pride. Consistent with past research indicating that social class underlies differential patterns of attending to the self versus orienting to others, higher social class was associated with greater self-oriented feelings of contentment and pride, and with greater amusement. In contrast, lower social class was associated with more other-oriented feelings of compassion and love, and with greater awe. There were no class differences in enthusiasm. We discuss that individuals from different social class backgrounds may exhibit different patterns of emotional responding due to their distinct social concerns and priorities. Whereas self-oriented emotions may follow from, foster, and reinforce upper class individuals’ desire for independence and self-sufficiency, greater other-oriented emotion may enable lower class individuals to form more interdependent bonds to cope with their more threatening environments.</li>

<p><em>human sexual cycles are driven by culture and match collective moods</em><br />
ian b. wood et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Human reproduction does not happen uniformly throughout the year and what drives human sexual cycles is a long-standing question. The literature is mixed with respect to whether biological or cultural factors best explain these cycles. The biological hypothesis proposes that human reproductive cycles are an adaptation to the seasonal (hemisphere-dependent) cycles, while the cultural hypothesis proposes that conception dates vary mostly due to cultural factors, such as holidays. However, for many countries, common records used to investigate these hypotheses are incomplete or unavailable, biasing existing analysis towards Northern Hemisphere Christian countries. Here we show that interest in sex peaks sharply online during major cultural and religious celebrations, regardless of hemisphere location. This online interest, when shifted by nine months, corresponds to documented human births, even after adjusting for numerous factors such as language and amount of free time due to holidays. We further show that mood, measured independently on Twitter, contains distinct collective emotions associated with those cultural celebrations. Our results provide converging evidence that the cyclic sexual and reproductive behavior of human populations is mostly driven by culture and that this interest in sex is associated with specific emotions, characteristic of major cultural and religious celebrations.</li>

<p><em>passion, relational mobility, and proof of commitment: a comparative socio–ecological analysis of an adaptive emotion in a sexual market</em><br />
junko yamada, mie kito, masaki yuki 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1474704917746056">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1474704917746056</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Although monogamy, the exclusive bonding with a specific partner, is one characteristic of modern human mating, long-term romantic relationships inherently possess the <em>commitment problem</em>, which is the conflict between maintaining a relationship with a certain partner and seeking attractive alternatives. Frank has argued that love and passion help solve this problem because they make individuals commit voluntarily to the relationship, leading the other party to also be committed with less concern over being cheated on or rejected. Combining this idea with the comparative socio‐ecological approach, we hypothesize that passion will be more pronounced in social environments in which people have greater freedom to choose and replace their partners (i.e., high relational mobility) than in societies in which relationships tend to be more stable and hard to change (i.e., low relational mobility). To test this hypothesis, we compared Americans (living in a society with high relational mobility) and Japanese (living in a society with low relational mobility). As predicted, Americans were more passionate toward their romantic partners than Japanese, and this cultural difference was partially explained by the levels of perceived relational mobility in participants’ local ecology. Moreover, more intense passion was found to lead to greater commitment behaviors in both societies. The importance of taking socioecological factors into consideration for the theory of the adaptive function of interpersonal emotions is also discussed.</li>

<p><em>mating strategy flexibility in the laboratory: preferences for long- and short-term mating change in response to evolutionarily relevant variables</em><br />
andrew g. thomas, steve stewart-williams 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.10.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.10.004</a></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the great challenges for evolutionary psychology has been to explain within-sex individual variation in mating behaviour. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of this variation stems from an adaptation for facultatively increasing or decreasing long- and short-term mating inclinations in response to circumstances. It remains unclear, however, how rapidly such changes can occur, and what stimuli might initiate them. This paper presents three experiments that investigate mating strategy change following exposure to the evolutionarily-relevant stimuli of parental care, resource-abundance, and danger. In each experiment, participants indicated their preferred relationship type (long-term, short-term, or none) for each of fifty other-sex individuals, both before and after priming. Relative to a control group, relationship preferences changed in all three experiments, in directions generally consistent with evolutionary psychological predictions. Moreover, short- and long-term relationship preferences were found to shift independently, such that a change in long-term preference was not accompanied by an opposite change in short-term, or vice versa. Together, these experiments represent the first direct test of the claim that brief interventions can shift the relative strength of people’s preferences for long-term and short-term relationships.</li>

<p><em>cooperation, clustering, and assortative mixing in dynamic networks</em><br />

<p>Understanding the patterns and processes of human cooperation is of central scientific importance. Networks can promote cooperation when their existing or emergent topology allows conditional cooperators in the network to isolate themselves from exploitation by noncooperators. We do not know from prior work whether the emergent structures that promote cooperation are driven by reputation or can emerge purely via dynamics, i.e., the severing of ties to noncooperators and the formation of new ties irrespective of reputational information. Here we demonstrate, experimentally, that dynamic networks yield very high rates of cooperation even without reputational knowledge. Further, we identify realistic conditions under which static networks (where ties cannot be altered) yield cooperation rates as high as those in dynamic networks.</p>
<p>Humans’ propensity to cooperate is driven by our embeddedness in social networks. A key mechanism through which networks promote cooperation is clustering. Within clusters, conditional cooperators are insulated from exploitation by noncooperators, allowing them to reap the benefits of cooperation. Dynamic networks, where ties can be shed and new ties formed, allow for the endogenous emergence of clusters of cooperators. Although past work suggests that either reputation processes or network dynamics can increase clustering and cooperation, existing work on network dynamics conflates reputations and dynamics. Here we report results from a large-scale experiment (total <em>n</em> = 2,675) that embedded participants in clustered or random networks that were static or dynamic, with varying levels of reputational information. Results show that initial network clustering predicts cooperation in static networks, but not in dynamic ones. Further, our experiment shows that while reputations are important for partner choice, cooperation levels are driven purely by dynamics. Supplemental conditions confirmed this lack of a reputation effect. Importantly, we find that when participants make individual choices to cooperate or defect with each partner, as opposed to a single decision that applies to all partners (as is standard in the literature on cooperation in networks), cooperation rates in static networks are as high as cooperation rates in dynamic networks. This finding highlights the importance of structured relations for sustained cooperation, and shows how giving experimental participants more realistic choices has important consequences for whether dynamic networks promote higher levels of cooperation than static networks.</p>

<li>it may be more probable that those to whom I could form a deep connection are more likely to have interests that are superficially different from mine. when we restrict our pool of potential friends based on presumed common interest we are really just decreasing our chance of finding them.</li>

<li>communication, like memory and all other processes, is actively imperfect. perfection would be detrimental to the function of the process</li>

<li>maintaining relationships
<ul>
<li>a lot of people will only be your friend if you appear to share all their opinions with them. this is the myth of identity. it goes much deeper, as people in positions of authority and power, like supposed teachers and mentors and police and doctors, will feel threatened if you do not have the same worldview as they do, because their self–worth and identity and happiness are chained to their values — and no matter how wonderful a person you are, they will treat you as a threat to themselves, their supposed society, their supposed civilisation. they will abuse you, suppress you and kill you, all because their values say you are a threat. what can we do about such “values”? the short answer is “not much” — there is no way to force a person to enlightenment. the better answer is to find and make friends with people who have broken the shackles of their values, and to create and grow a society and a civilisation that cherishes everyone
<ul>
<li>for some, the veneer of civilisation is thin, brittle, easily broken, torn. but we cannot create a civilisation while hiding from all abusers and oppressors — because we would also be hiding from each other</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>expectations set by interactions with others - like the seeding done by exposure to random number influences numerical estimates, so also do the conditions under which we live and work alters our expectations and thinking.</li>
<li>in relationships, failure to understand what it takes to maintain and grow a relationship leads to the failure of the relationship, not a mysterious “falling out of love”. if you don't achieve together, you fall apart. and when your partner or friend does not or cannot share your dreams then it is much harder to achieve something together.</li>
<li>don't assume that one thing leads to another you may have to leave those friends behind that only want to be friends because they think you are similar to each other — as you grow you will probably grow differently before you grow similarly.</li>
<li>like children born in a war, or someone whose parents are separated and always fighting, how can we learn what a real relationship is like? the only way is to find and observe others around us who are making real relationships and if that is not available, to find clues in stories and imagine what it is to make a real relationship work. that is why i love stories so much, and why imagination is so important.</li>
<li>false economy to be miserly with friendship, must be generous to share friendship even if only one in ten people is open enough to become best friend. am willing to take the risk of rejection because we may share a beautiful friendship together.</li>
<li>language of heart–to–hearts is not written or spoken language,
<ul>
<li>it is the language that Cattie recently retaught me, it is the language of slow blinking, of nuzzling and brushing :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>trusting each other means that communications are much easier, as meanings of interactions are clearer, for example trust that what is said is literally true or the best possible interpretation of this.</li>
<li>in communication, as well as translating and other informational arts involving words, and more generally, we would be deluding ourselves if we believed there is an exact translation or match from one word–meaning to another. rather, there is a region, a cloud of possible meaning, dependent on context, within which the intention resides.
<ul>
<li>to learn an language or to communicate fully with another person we need to understand first the gist of the meaning (thus the exact translation can sometimes be misleading compared to a rough translation) and then must proceed from there to understand the particular meaning given by the speaker or writer or originator.</li>
</ul>

<li>authentic
<ul>
<li>from heart to heart</li>

<li>some people only wiser in explaining relationships consciously, not in relationships themselves.</li>

<ul>
<li>most people do not know what love is, nor want to learn what it is — just hope that it will happen. is it any wonder that many relationships do not last?</li>
<li>many relationships end because one or more of the people do not continue to grow and change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00235</h2>
<ul>
<li>it is not things that people seek, rather it is love, connection, meaning.</li>
<li>when we are able to accept each other as we are, we no longer need to persuade or defend, and can love and communicate more readily.</li>
<li>things and experiences and memories do not make people happy — it is people that make people happy, along with the earth.</li>
