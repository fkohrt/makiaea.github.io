<ul>
<li>scattershot
<ul>
<li>Scattershot approach to knowledge, all it takes is one thing to be very right and your investment in many things which have not come true yet has already paid off</li>
<li>1/n rule of investment is to invest equally across all opportunities. this works because losses will occur and are spread across many areas but we also give opportunity to the rare chance that has very high return. this is the same whether for financial investments or for evolutionary investments.</li>
<li>so what did i learn? well i made sure not to put all my eggs in one basket, and also not to get my hopes too high. i made sure to approach the whole thing as a learning experience and to appreciate the tools and processes that i created in the process of applying. i made sure to get on with my life in the meantime and not to put too much store by the outcome</li>
<li>it is a mistake to put our hopes on someone being perfect. people are often far from what they would like to be, and to place the burden of our expectation solely on one person is to invite disappointment. this does not mean we don't love them, just that it is wise to keep eggs in more than one basket. if there is something you know a person is not able to do, do not hope that they can suddenly do it when you need them to. make alternative plans so things can still work out.</li>
<li>the more I learn, the more I understand that “there but for the grace of god go I” — even though have been abused as have many others, was “lucky” enough that was moved away from most influences by parental job postings (expat) and that most influences could not follow me as a child (pre–internet) — a scattershot childhood allowed bad influences to wane and good influences to have a chance</li>
<li>scattershot is needed in science, where scarcity of publication and concentrated time and effort investment necessitated by current scientific publication method gives incentive for rose–tinted observations and unwillingness to move on</li>
</ul>

<li><em>black swan</em><br />
on the influence of rare, important, unpredictable events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>05399</h2>
<ul>
<li>unlikely friendship
<ul>
<li>interested in the unexpected results of events with small probability but large direct impact on people</li>
<li>for example, if someone you meet is more enthusiastic about the friendship between you than you are, most people's reaction would be to assume they are trying to gain something from you that they couldn't do themselves – otherwise, the thinking goes, why would they be so enthusiastic? surely they should be less enthusiastic if they were self–sufficient? now in 98% of cases, this will be true – which is why people often can rely on it as a rule of thumb. especially in avoiding relationships with abusive and dangerous people. this is very important, and the reason this reaction is the usual one is because it has high survival potential. however, there is the tiny possibility (we guess 2% but it's just a guess) that this reaction is not as appropriate as it usually is. now is it worth modifying our behaviour in order to connect with that 2% worth the risk of dealing with the dangerous and abusive people that this will likely expose us to? again the likelihood for most people is no, it is not worth it, which is why the ordinary behaviour is as we see it. so why are we talking about this today? as you have probably already guessed, the reason is because it is possible to make the connection with those 2% of cases, and that you have already done so.</li>
<li>not only have we already connected with those 2%, but we are a significant part of that 2% ourselves.</li>
<li>the (( )) goes here (tangential to our point but still relevant)</li>
<li>the normal optimum is either to match the level of enthusiasm of your friend or to be slightly more or less enthusiastic and allow your friend to match that level.</li>
<li>however for us it is particularly important to deepen friendship in the time we have available ––– which is shorter than that for 98% if people. (due to the way we live far apart, but in the story this could be because we don't live as long or exist as long in the same world)</li>
<li>so to us, ways of deepening friendship are precious but unfortunately cannot be used with people who are not ready, who are not able to accept or deal with this, for people currently not in the 2%. now it might not be possible to tell who is ready or not, so one approach is to allow an open–ended development which covers both ordinary and the 2%. for example, if you have material accessible to the 2% that they can use to find out more about you (facebook, essays, books) to see what you already share in common, be it hobbies, interests or approaches to life. now it is possible, as we mentioned before, that abusive people will try to use that information too, so we bear this in mind when creating and sharing those materials. also, non–abusive people outside the 2% may well misinterpret that information, and sometimes it might be disheartening that we haven't encountered the 2% who understand and accept us for who we are and how we will grow together instead of what we can do for them or what they might get out of us; sometimes it might be hard to take the negative responses that those outside the 2% give –– after all, if you meet a hundred people and ninety eight don't understand, that may seem a bit much. what we must try to do is to remember the 2% and to keep our hope that we will someday meet.</li>
<li>now as to how we can behave towards that 2%, we can be completely honest with our feelings and opinions, knowing that even if we differ in opinion, not only may we understand the other's point of view, but also that we can accept them no matter how different their point of view may appear at first. we connect to and bond with each other as and when we can and though we might miss individual friends, we have support from other friends while we are apart. at the same time it is good to have ways of calling for help from friends near and far when we need it. also we can sometimes be too absorbed in work and so need to remember to spend time bonding with friends.</li>
<li>so aside from being happily absorbed in our own work, or joint work, we are happy bonding with friends.</li>

<li>now before talk further about why this is, let's take a precautionary step back, and ask –– where are we going with this? this is an especially important question to ask because when 98% of speakers (to guess at another figure) want you to agree with them for some reason, an easy way for them to do this is to say how especially important you are. abusive people very often use this because it is highly effective – for example, to get someone to buy something, to distract attention from abuse, or to get someone to join a cult. so what guarantees are there that this is not the same as that? you will have to decide for yourself, but let us add that any saying or speech can be used for abusive purposes so it is up to you and your friends to protect yourselves and each other.</li>
<li>the very next step is often to deny any connection with abuse etc. and to say that we are aiming for general ideals, principles, world welfare, improving lives, and so on; you can imagine it for yourself. some kind of technique to get people hooked, a kind of spell to enchant them.</li>

relationships between variables that hold in the<br />

<p><em>on the relationship between personal experience, affect and risk perception: the case of climate change</em><br />
sander van der linden 2014</p>

<ul>
<li>Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the “cognitive” model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed.</li>

<li>
<p>improbability principle<br />
(quoted from?)</p>
<ul>
<li>The law of inevitability says that something must happen. It says that if you make a complete list of all possible outcomes then one of them must occur. This law is so obvious that we often fail to notice it—just as we normally don’t notice the air we breathe. This law says that even if each of the possible outcomes has a tiny probability of occurring, it’s certain that one of them will: it makes the highly improbable certain.</li>
<li>The law of truly large numbers says that, with a large enough number of opportunities, any outrageous thing is likely to happen. If you throw that handful of dice enough times, eventually they’ll all come up 6’s. It may be highly improbable that any one throw will produce all 6’s, but given enough opportunities it becomes almost unavoidable.</li>
<li>The law of selection says you can make probabilities as high as you like if you choose after the event. My favorite example is painting the targets after the arrows have landed. The effect of selection in that example is evident; it makes the outcome certain. But often it’s not obvious that a selection process is going on. If I select the students who do best in a test, I may not realize that I am also selecting those who are most likely to decline in performance at the next test.</li>
<li>The law of the probability lever says that a slight change in circumstances can have a huge impact on probabilities. We think of the earth as flat where we live, but if we keep going in one direction for long enough, we end up back where we started. The very slight, indeed imperceptible curve of the earth has major consequences. And in a similar way, the law of the probability lever bends probabilities, with the potential to increase them by huge factors.</li>
<li>The law of near enough says that events that are sufficiently similar may be regarded as identical. No two measurements are identical to an infinite number of decimal places, but in the real world, measurements are often so close that we regard them as the same. The probability that there will be a dead heat in a race depends on the accuracy of our stopwatch.</li>

<p>alone for a while / i’ve been searching through the dark<br />
for traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart<br />
a mosaic / of / the pieces that remain<br />
a melody of life / love lost’s refrain</p>
<p>our paths they did cross / though we cannot say just why<br />
we met / we laughed / we held on fast / and then we said goodbye<br />
to weave a fabric for fables yet untold<br />
let them ring out loud as they unfold</p>
<p>in my dearest memories / i see you reaching out to me<br />
though you’re gone, i still remember that you called / out my name</p>
<p>☆a voice from the past / joining yours and mine<br />
　adding to the layers of harmony<br />
　and so it goes, on and on<br />
　melodies of life,<br />
　to the sky beyond the soaring birds<br />
　forever and ever</p>
<p>so far and away, see the birds as they fly by<br />
soaring through the shadows / of the clouds up in the sky<br />
i have laid my memories and dreams upon those wings<br />
leave them now and see what tomorrow brings</p>
<p>in your dearest memories / do you remember loving me?<br />
was it fate / that brought us close and now leaves / me behind?</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>if i should leave / this lonely world behind<br />
a voice will still remember our harmonies<br />
now i know we’ll carry on<br />
melodies of life<br />
entwine and bond deep in our hearts<br />
as long as we remember</p>

<li>I love my cat. she is the sweetest, fluffiest, most adorable cat. one night she is asleep laying on my crotch — it’s like a warm ray of sun, irresistible. well, that night also my baby son is asleep on my chest, in a pouch, so I cannot see that the cable running from by daughter’s pink headphones on my head to her ipad on which I just finished watching a film — that cable ran straight under the cat, right over my crotch. no sooner do I remove the headphones, thinking to take a nap, that the cable moves beneath the cat and startles her, triggering her claws to steady herself…</li>

<li>often what is missing is not learning, but rather unlearning. helpful solutions are plentiful but unhelpful solutions are even more plentiful. without learning how to sort the grain from the chaff, we are at the mercy of circumstance.</li>
<li>luck is the illusion of helpful events occurring at a helpful time. in reality many things occur beyond our notice, many of which are helpful or unhelpful, but we do not notice them — what we call luck is simply us noticing some seemingly helpful events as they occur or after they occur.</li>

<li>it can be difficult to acknowledge the full role that random chance or intention plays in our lives. unless we focus on something, we barely know the outlines of what it is — but when we do focus, it can draw our attention too much and can neglect the outlines of the other things outside our current focus.</li>

<li>the bad things that people do to you, to each other, to the world — we really do not understand what we do… if we did truly understand, we would not do these things. bad things that people do to you — mostly they do not know even who you are, or are acting on an image they have of you, not who you truly are. this is because our society and culture has not evolved yet to deal with our reality. so too the good things that people do — it may be that we mostly do them without understanding what we are truly doing, and any good consequences too are just luck rather than the result of understanding. by this reasoning, we cannot take credit for the good things we do, nor the blame for the bad things we do — we are still as children, not understanding the consequences of what we do, of how we live our lives.</li>

<ul>
<li>just as when we lead with a positive result, the next is more likely to be less positive, when we lead with a random result, the next is likely to be in our favour. how to express this? reversing entropy? that is, when we take high randomness is first instance, then next is lower in randomness?</li>
<li>coin toss interpretation is a product of this intuitive understanding of entropy. we intuitively sense that a heads should be more likely to be followed by a tails, because we are interpreting the result in terms of entropy rather than probabilty — probability says that the second result is independent of the first wheras entropy says otherwise.</li>
<li>high result should in more cases be followed by lower result than same or higher, low result should in more cases be followed by higher result than same or lower. so with entropy? is this why high randomness is followed in more cases by lower randomness than same or higher randomness?</li>
<li>is this what we are (mis)labelling as “balance”? possible interpretation of yin–yang? esoteric teachings as ways of learning reality without mathematical constructs?</li>
