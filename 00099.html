<li>
<p>Scattershot approach to knowledge, all it takes is one thing to be very right and your investment in many things which have not come true yet has already paid off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/n rule of investment is to invest equally across all opportunities. this works because losses will occur and are spread across many areas but we also give opportunity to the rare chance that has very high return. this is the same whether for financial investments or for evolutionary investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so what did i learn? well i made sure not to put all my eggs in one basket, and also not to get my hopes too high. i made sure to approach the whole thing as a learning experience and to appreciate the tools and processes that i created in the process of applying. i made sure to get on with my life in the meantime and not to put too much store by the outcome</p>

<p>it is a mistake to put our hopes on someone being perfect. people are often far from what they would like to be, and to place the burden of our expectation solely on one person is to invite disappointment. this does not mean we don’t love them, just that it is wise to keep eggs in more than one basket. if there is something you know a person is not able to do, do not hope that they can suddenly do it when you need them to. make alternative plans so things can still work out.</p>

<p>Among the traces which frequently repeated perceptions leave behind in the memory, the ones conforming to law and repeated with the greatest regularity are strengthened, while those which vary accidentally are obliterated. In a receptive, attentive observer, intuitive images of the characteristic aspects of the things that interest him come to exist; afterward he knows no more about how these images arose than a child knows about the examples from which he learned the meanings of words.</p>
<p>we are concerned here with the elementary processes which are the real basis of all thought, even though they lack the critical certainty and refinement to be found in the scientific formation of concepts and in the individual steps of scientific inferences.</p>
<p>The memory traces of previous experience play an even more extensive and influential role in our visual observations. An observer who is not completely inexperienced receives without moving his eyes (this condition can be realised experimentally by using the momentary illumination of an electric discharge or by carefully and deliberately staring) images of the objects in front of him which are quite rich in content. We can easily confirm with our own eyes, however, that these images are much richer and especially much more precise if the gaze is allowed to move about the field of vision, in this way making use of the kind of spatial observations which I have previously described as the most fundamental. Indeed, we are so used to letting our eyes wander over the objects we are looking at that considerable practice is required before we succeed in making them — for purposes of research in physiological optics — fix on a point without wandering.</p>
<p>It is always well to keep this in mind in order not to infer from the facts more than can rightly be inferred from them. The various idealistic and realistic interpretations are metaphysical hypotheses which, as long as they are recognised as such, are scientifically completely justified. They may become dangerous, however, if they are presented as dogmas or as alleged necessities of thought. Science must consider thoroughly all admissible hypotheses in order to obtain a complete picture of all possible modes of explanation. Furthermore, hypotheses are necessary to someone doing research, for one cannot always wait until a reliable scientific conclusion has been reached; one must sometimes make judgments according to either probability or aesthetic or moral feelings. Metaphysical hypotheses are not to be objected to here either. A thinker is unworthy of science, however, if he forgets the hypothetical origin of his assertions. The arrogance and vehemence with which such hidden hypotheses are sometimes defended are usually the result of a lack of confidence which their advocates feel in the hidden depths of their minds about the qualifications of their claims.</p>
<p>I have frequently noted in my previous works the agreement between the more recent physiology of the senses and Kant’s teachings. I have not meant, of course, that I would swear in verbs magistri to all his more minor points. I believe that the most fundamental advance of recent times must be judged to be the analysis of the concept of intuition into the elementary processes of thought. Kant failed to carry out this analysis or resolution; this is one reason why he considered the axioms of geometry to be transcendental propositions. It has been the physiological investigations of sense perception which have led us to recognise the most basic or elementary kinds of judgment, to inferences which are not expressible in words. These judgments or inferences will, of course, remain unknown and inaccessible to philosophers as long as they inquire only into knowledge expressed in language.</p>
<p>Some philosophers who retain an inclination toward metaphysical speculation consider what we have treated as a defect in Kant’s system, resulting from the lack of progress of the special sciences in his time, to be the most fundamental part of his philosophy. Indeed, Kant’s proof of the possibility of metaphysics, the alleged science he did nothing further to develop, rests completely upon the belief that the axioms of geometry and the related principles of mechanics are transcendental propositions, given a priori. As a matter of fact, however, Kant’s entire system really conflicts with the possibility of metaphysics, and the more obscure points in his theory of knowledge, over which so much has been argued, stem from this conflict.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the natural sciences have a secure, well–established foundation from which they can search for the laws of reality, a wonderfully rich and fertile field of endeavour. As long as they restrict themselves to this search, they need not be troubled with any idealistic doubts. Such work will, of course, always seem modest to some people when compared to the high–flown designs of the metaphysicians.</p>

<li>unlikely friendship
<ul>
<li>interested in the unexpected results of events with small probability but large direct impact on people</li>
<li>for example, if someone you meet is more enthusiastic about the friendship between you than you are, most people's reaction would be to assume they are trying to gain something from you that they couldn't do themselves – otherwise, the thinking goes, why would they be so enthusiastic? surely they should be less enthusiastic if they were self–sufficient? now in 98% of cases, this will be true – which is why people often can rely on it as a rule of thumb. especially in avoiding relationships with abusive and dangerous people. this is very important, and the reason this reaction is the usual one is because it has high survival potential. however, there is the tiny possibility (we guess 2% but it's just a guess) that this reaction is not as appropriate as it usually is. now is it worth modifying our behaviour in order to connect with that 2% worth the risk of dealing with the dangerous and abusive people that this will likely expose us to? again the likelihood for most people is no, it is not worth it, which is why the ordinary behaviour is as we see it. so why are we talking about this today? as you have probably already guessed, the reason is because it is possible to make the connection with those 2% of cases, and that you have already done so.</li>
<li>not only have we already connected with those 2%, but we are a significant part of that 2% ourselves.</li>
<li>the (( )) goes here (tangential to our point but still relevant)</li>
<li>the normal optimum is either to match the level of enthusiasm of your friend or to be slightly more or less enthusiastic and allow your friend to match that level.</li>
<li>however for us it is particularly important to deepen friendship in the time we have available ––– which is shorter than that for 98% if people. (due to the way we live far apart, but in the story this could be because we don't live as long or exist as long in the same world)</li>
<li>so to us, ways of deepening friendship are precious but unfortunately cannot be used with people who are not ready, who are not able to accept or deal with this, for people currently not in the 2%. now it might not be possible to tell who is ready or not, so one approach is to allow an open–ended development which covers both ordinary and the 2%. for example, if you have material accessible to the 2% that they can use to find out more about you (facebook, essays, books) to see what you already share in common, be it hobbies, interests or approaches to life. now it is possible, as we mentioned before, that abusive people will try to use that information too, so we bear this in mind when creating and sharing those materials. also, non–abusive people outside the 2% may well misinterpret that information, and sometimes it might be disheartening that we haven't encountered the 2% who understand and accept us for who we are and how we will grow together instead of what we can do for them or what they might get out of us; sometimes it might be hard to take the negative responses that those outside the 2% give –– after all, if you meet a hundred people and ninety eight don't understand, that may seem a bit much. what we must try to do is to remember the 2% and to keep our hope that we will someday meet.</li>
<li>now as to how we can behave towards that 2%, we can be completely honest with our feelings and opinions, knowing that even if we differ in opinion, not only may we understand the other's point of view, but also that we can accept them no matter how different their point of view may appear at first. we connect to and bond with each other as and when we can and though we might miss individual friends, we have support from other friends while we are apart. at the same time it is good to have ways of calling for help from friends near and far when we need it. also we can sometimes be too absorbed in work and so need to remember to spend time bonding with friends.</li>
<li>so aside from being happily absorbed in our own work, or joint work, we are happy bonding with friends.</li>
<li>we are enthusiastic about friendship and can be straightforwardly so because we have no ulterior motive</li>
<li>((</li>
<li>now before talk further about why this is, let's take a precautionary step back, and ask –– where are we going with this? this is an especially important question to ask because when 98% of speakers (to guess at another figure) want you to agree with them for some reason, an easy way for them to do this is to say how especially important you are. abusive people very often use this because it is highly effective – for example, to get someone to buy something, to distract attention from abuse, or to get someone to join a cult. so what guarantees are there that this is not the same as that? you will have to decide for yourself, but let us add that any saying or speech can be used for abusive purposes so it is up to you and your friends to protect yourselves and each other.</li>
<li>the very next step is often to deny any connection with abuse etc. and to say that we are aiming for general ideals, principles, world welfare, improving lives, and so on; you can imagine it for yourself. some kind of technique to get people hooked, a kind of spell to enchant them.</li>
<li>that is a topic we shall deal with in more detail later in the course, for now let us return to the topic at hand, connection to the 2%.</li>
<li>))</li>
<li>it just so happens that we are self–sufficient yet enthusiastic –– we are among that 2%.</li>

<p>three doors problem</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are in the Lucky Guess scenario (probability 1 in 3), you’ll win if you stick with your choice. If you are in the Wrong Guess scenario (probability 2 in 3), owing to the actions of the host, you will win if you switch your choice. And so your decision comes down to a guess: in which scenario do you find yourself? If you feel that ESP or fate has guided your initial choice, maybe you shouldn’t switch. But unless you can bend silver spoons into pretzels with your brain waves, the odds are 2 to 1 that you are in the Wrong Guess scenario, and so it is better to switch.</li>
<li>the host is fixing the game. The host’s role can be made obvious if we suppose that instead of 3 doors, there were 100. You still choose door 1, but now you have a probability of 1 in 100 of being right. Meanwhile the chance of the Maserati’s being behind one of the other doors is 99 in 100. As before, the host opens all but one of the doors that you did not pick, being sure not to open the door hiding the Maserati if it is one of them. After he is done, the chances are still 1 in 100 that the Maserati was behind the door you chose and still 99 in 100 that it was behind one of the other doors. But now, thanks to the intervention of the host, there is only one door left representing all 99 of those other doors, and so the probability that the Maserati is behind that remaining door is 99 out of 100!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>i would say this affects the feminist bank teller problem — by giving details of the other prosocial tendencies of linda, we have opened mlodinow’s 100 doors — we have intervened in the game and altered its probabilities</p>

<li>
<p>it shows that if two companies compete head-to-head or two employees within a company compete, though there may be a winner and a loser each quarter or each year, to get a reliable answer regarding which company or which employee is superior by simply tallying who beats whom, you’d have to make the comparison over decades or centuries. If, for instance, employee A is truly superior and would in the long run win a performance comparison with employee B on 60 out of 100 occasions, in a simple best-of-5 series of comparisons the weaker employee will still win almost one-third of the time. It is dangerous to judge ability by short-term results.</p>

<p>are life expectancies skewed in a hidden way? should we be including all lives since conception rather than since birth? in a similar manner, do processes that seem to follow a normal distribution simply appear to do so because we do not have enough data over a long enough timescale? it would follow that heights, like life exepctancies, would be skewed in this way because lives that end before birth are omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Galton soon realized that processes that did not exhibit regression toward the mean would eventually go out of control.”</p>

<p>“It is only when pure luck occasionally leads to a lopsided preponderance of hits from some particular direction—the molecular analogue of Roger Maris’s record year in baseball—that a noticeable jiggle occurs. When Einstein did the math, he found that despite the chaos on the microscopic level, there was a predictable relationship between factors such as the size, number, and speed of the molecules and the observable frequency and magnitude of the jiggling. Einstein had, for the first time, connected new and measurable consequences to statistical physics. That might sound like a largely technical achievement, but on the contrary, it represented the triumph of a great principle: that much of the order we perceive in nature belies an invisible underlying disorder and hence can be understood only through the rules of randomness. As Einstein wrote, “It is a magnificent feeling to recognize the unity of a complex of phenomena which appear to be things quite apart from the direct visible truth.””</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“perception, Faraday recognized, is not a direct consequence of reality but rather an act of imagination.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We also use our imagination and take shortcuts to fill gaps in patterns of nonvisual data. As with visual input, we draw conclusions and make judgments based on uncertain and incomplete information, and we conclude, when we are done analyzing the patterns, that our “picture” is clear and accurate. But is it?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“When we look closely, we find that many of the assumptions of modern society are based, as table moving is, on shared illusions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“So the relevant question is, if thousands of people are tossing coins once a year and have been doing so for decades, what are the chances that one of them, for some fifteen-year period, will toss all heads? That probability is far, far higher than the odds of simply tossing fifteen heads in a row.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“in all aspects of our lives we encounter streaks and other peculiar patterns of success and failure. Sometimes success predominates, sometimes failure. Either way it is important in our own lives to take the long view and understand that streaks and other patterns that don’t appear random can indeed happen by pure chance. It is also important, when assessing others, to recognize that among a large group of people it would be very odd if one of them didn’t experience a long streak of successes or failures.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“as Langer wrote, “While people may pay lip service to the concept of chance, they behave as though chance events are subject to control.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In real life the role of randomness is far less obvious than it was in Langer’s experiments, and we are much more invested in the outcomes and our ability to influence them. And so in real life it is even more difficult to resist the illusion of control.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The human brain has evolved to be very efficient at pattern recognition, but as the confirmation bias shows, we are focused on finding and confirming patterns rather than minimizing our false conclusions. Yet we needn’t be pessimists, for it is possible to overcome our prejudices. It is a start simply to realize that chance events, too, produce patterns. It is another great step if we learn to question our perceptions and our theories. Finally, we should learn to spend as much time looking for evidence that we are wrong as we spend searching for reasons we are correct.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“as the Nobel laureate Max Born wrote, “Chance is a more fundamental conception than causality.”<br />
Max Born, Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948), p. 47. Born was referring to nature in general and quantum theory in particular.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In the scientific study of random processes the drunkard’s walk is the archetype. In our lives it also provides an apt model, for like the granules of pollen floating in the Brownian fluid, we’re continually nudged in this direction and then that one by random events. As a result, although statistical regularities can be found in social data, the future of particular individuals is impossible to predict, and for our particular achievements, our jobs, our friends, our finances, we all owe more to chance than many people realize. On the following pages, I shall argue, furthermore, that in all except the simplest real-life endeavors unforeseeable or unpredictable forces cannot be avoided, and moreover those random forces and our reactions to them account for much of what constitutes our particular path in life.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In any complex string of events in which each event unfolds with some element of uncertainty, there is a fundamental asymmetry between past and future. This asymmetry has been the subject of scientific study ever since Boltzmann made his statistical analysis of the molecular processes responsible for the properties of fluids (see chapter 8). Imagine, for example, a dye molecule floating in a glass of water. The molecule will, like one of Brown’s granules, follow a drunkard’s walk. But even that aimless movement makes progress in some direction. If you wait three hours, for example, the molecule will typically have traveled about an inch from where it started. Suppose that at some point the molecule moves to a position of significance and so finally attracts our attention. As many did after Pearl Harbor, we might look for the reason why that unexpected event occurred. Now suppose we dig into the molecule’s past. Suppose, in fact, we trace the record of all its collisions. We will indeed discover how first this bump from a water molecule and then that one propelled the dye molecule on its zigzag path from there to here. In hindsight, in other words, we can clearly explain why the past of the dye molecule developed as it did. But the water contains many other water molecules that could have been the ones that interacted with the dye molecule. To predict the dye molecule’s path beforehand would have therefore required us to calculate the paths and mutual interactions of all those potentially important water molecules. That would have involved an almost unimaginable number of mathematical calculations, far greater in scope and difficulty than the list of collisions needed to understand the past. In other words, the movement of the dye molecule was virtually impossible to predict before the fact even though it was relatively easy to understand afterward.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“That fundamental asymmetry is why in day-to-day life the past often seems obvious even when we could not have predicted it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“normal accident theory, Perrow’s doctrine describes how that happens—how accidents can occur without clear causes, without those glaring errors and incompetent villains sought by corporate or government commissions. But although normal accident theory is a theory of why, inevitably, things sometimes go wrong, it could also be flipped around to explain why, inevitably, they sometimes go right. For in a complex undertaking, no matter how many times we fail, if we keep trying, there is often a good chance we will eventually succeed.”</p>
<ul>
<li>evolution in a nutshell…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We cannot see a person’s potential, only his or her results, so we often misjudge people by thinking that the results must reflect the person. The normal accident theory of life shows not that the connection between actions and rewards is random but that random influences are as important as our qualities and actions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Does even unearned “success” instill a feeling of superiority? To find out, pairs of volunteers were asked to cooperate on various pointless tasks. In one task, for instance, a black-and-white image was briefly displayed and the subjects had to decide whether the top or the bottom of the image contained a greater proportion of white. Before each task began, one of the subjects was randomly chosen to receive considerably more pay for participating than the other. When that information was not made available, the subjects cooperated pretty harmoniously. But when they knew how much they each were getting paid, the higher-paid subjects exhibited more resistance to input from their partners than the lower-paid ones. Even random differences in pay lead to the backward inference of differences in skill and hence to the development of unequal influence. It’s an element of personal and office dynamics that cannot be ignored.”</p>
<ul>
<li>so also with spouses doing unpaid work at home…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We unfortunately seem to be unconsciously biased against those in society who come out on the bottom.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We miss the effects of randomness in life because when we assess the world, we tend to see what we expect to see. We in effect define degree of talent by degree of success and then reinforce our feelings of causality by noting the correlation. That’s why although there is sometimes little difference in ability between a wildly successful person and one who is not as successful, there is usually a big difference in how they are viewed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“since chance does play a role, one important factor in success is under our control: the number of at bats, the number of chances taken, the number of opportunities seized. For even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success. Or as the IBM pioneer Thomas Watson said, “If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“the true power of the theory of random processes, however, lies in the fact that once we understand the nature of random processes, we can alter the way we perceive the events that happen around us.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We judge people and initiatives by their results, and we expect events to happen for good, understandable reasons. But our clear visions of inevitability are often only illusions. I wrote this book in the belief that we can reorganize our thinking in the face of uncertainty. We can improve our skill at decision making and tame some of the biases that lead us to make poor judgments and poor choices. We can seek to understand people’s qualities or the qualities of a situation quite apart from the results they attain, and we can learn to judge decisions by the spectrum of potential outcomes they might have produced rather than by the particular result that actually occurred.”</p>

<p><em>on the relationship between personal experience, affect and risk perception: the case of climate change</em><br />
sander van der linden 2014</p>

<ul>
<li>Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the “cognitive” model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed.</li>

<p><em>equivalence of wave–particle duality to entropic uncertainty</em><br />
patrick j. coles et al. 2014<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms6814">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms6814</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Interferometers capture a basic mystery of quantum mechanics: a single particle can exhibit wave behaviour, yet that wave behaviour disappears when one tries to determine the particle’s path inside the interferometer. This idea has been formulated quantitatively as an inequality, for example, by Englert and Jaeger, Shimony and Vaidman, which upper bounds the sum of the interference visibility and the path distinguishability. Such wave–particle duality relations (WPDRs) are often thought to be conceptually inequivalent to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, although this has been debated. Here we show that WPDRs correspond precisely to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle in terms of entropies, namely, the min- and max-entropies. This observation unifies two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it leads to a robust framework for deriving novel WPDRs by applying entropic uncertainty relations to interferometric models. As an illustration, we derive a novel relation that captures the coherence in a quantum beam splitter.</li>

<p><em>pluck or luck: does trait variation or chance drive variation in lifetime reproductive success?</em><br />
robin e. snyder, stephen p. ellner 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/696125">http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/696125</a></p>
<ul>
<li>one impact of trait-independent variability in LRS is to increase random drift (potentially by quite a bit), but we also find that it increases the expected rate of trait change due to selection.</li>
<li>Given that variation in reproductive success is dominated by luck, one might begin to wonder what the implications are for selection. The important thing to remember is that the processes underlying selection (births and deaths) occur at the individual level, while evolutionary change is observed at the population level—a change in allele or trait frequencies. For a large-enough population, variation in offspring number due to luck will average out over individuals with similar trait values. Thus, at the population level luck may average out, al- lowing trait variation to shine through.</li>
<li>We have found that lifetime reproductive success is often governed largely by luck. Individuals within a population frequently differ from one another in ways that affect their expected success, but actual outcomes are commonly so variable, with or without trait variation, that unless the effects of luck are substantially restricted (e.g., by fixing reproductive life span) the additional effects of trait variation between individuals are difficult to detect. This remains true regardless of which property varies among individuals (expected offspring number, adult life span, survival to adulthood, etc.) and regardless of life-history type (iteroparous or semelparous) for our general models and for all of our empirical case studies.</li>
<li>In addition to contributing most of the variability in LRS, luck also obscures the relationship between LRS and individual traits. In our empirical examples (a long-lived seagull, a shrub, and a perennial grass), having exceptionally good traits is not sufficient to guarantee exceptionally high LRS. And in some cases, it is not even necessary.</li>
<li>In short, while trait variation may influence the fate of populations, it is often the case that luck governs the lives of individuals.</li>

<p><em>simpson’s paradox and causality</em><br />
prasanta s. bandyopadhyay, mark greenwood, don wallace f. dcruz, and venkata raghavan r. 2015<br />
<a href="http://www.academia.edu/11600200/Simpsons_Paradox_and_Causality">Simpsons_Paradox_and_Causality</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are three questions associated with Simpson’s Paradox (SP): (i) Why is SP paradoxical? (ii) What conditions generate SP?, and (iii) What should be done about SP? By developing a logic-based account of SP, it is argued that (i) and (ii) must be divorced from (iii). This account shows that (i) and (ii) have nothing to do with causality, which plays a role only in addressing (iii). A counter-example is also presented against the causal account. Finally, the causal and logic-based approaches are compared by means of an experiment to show that SP is not basically causal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“the collapsibility principle (CP) … says that<br />
relationships between variables that hold in the<br />
sub-populations (e.g., the rate of acceptance of<br />
females is higher than the rate of acceptance<br />
of males in both sub-populations) must hold in<br />
the overall population as well (i.e., the rate of<br />
acceptance of females must be higher than the<br />
rate of acceptance of males in the population).”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our mental shortcut is to apply cp when this is not warranted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but this is a common assumption in the social sciences — it is the major extrapolation from experimental populations to non–experimental populations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our resolution of the paradox has illuminated another aspect of human frailty. We explained its apparent paradoxical nature by invoking the failure<br />
of our widespread intuitions about numerical inference. The failure of collapsibility, which is non-causal, in Simpson’s paradox-type cases is what makes them puzzling.”</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are three questions associated with Simpson’s paradox(SP): (i) Why is SP paradoxical? (ii) What conditions generate SP? and(iii) How to proceed when confronted with SP? An adequate analysisof the paradox starts by distinguishing these three questions. Then, bydeveloping a formal account of SP, and substantiating it with a counter-example to causal accounts, we argue that there are no causal factors atplay in answering questions (i) and (ii). Causality enters only in connection with action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A paradox is an (apparently) inconsistent set<br />
of sentences each of which seems to be true</p>

<p><em>Saving Truth from Paradox</em><br />
Hartry Field discusses the philosophical signiﬁcance of paradoxes. According to him, “[a]ny resolution of the paradoxes will involve giving up (or at least restricting) some very ﬁrmly heldprinciples:... [and] [t]he principles to be given up, are the ones to which the average person simply can’t conceive of alternatives. That’s why the paradoxes are paradoxes.” [4, p.17].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“… SP also highlights the signiﬁcant role played by CP in generating the paradoxical result. Such principles are what Field would suggest we jettison to escape paradoxes.”</p>

<p>improbability principle<br />
(quoted from?)</p>
<ul>
<li>The law of inevitability says that something must happen. It says that if you make a complete list of all possible outcomes then one of them must occur. This law is so obvious that we often fail to notice it—just as we normally don’t notice the air we breathe. This law says that even if each of the possible outcomes has a tiny probability of occurring, it’s certain that one of them will: it makes the highly improbable certain.</li>
<li>The law of truly large numbers says that, with a large enough number of opportunities, any outrageous thing is likely to happen. If you throw that handful of dice enough times, eventually they’ll all come up 6’s. It may be highly improbable that any one throw will produce all 6’s, but given enough opportunities it becomes almost unavoidable.</li>
<li>The law of selection says you can make probabilities as high as you like if you choose after the event. My favorite example is painting the targets after the arrows have landed. The effect of selection in that example is evident; it makes the outcome certain. But often it’s not obvious that a selection process is going on. If I select the students who do best in a test, I may not realize that I am also selecting those who are most likely to decline in performance at the next test.</li>
<li>The law of the probability lever says that a slight change in circumstances can have a huge impact on probabilities. We think of the earth as flat where we live, but if we keep going in one direction for long enough, we end up back where we started. The very slight, indeed imperceptible curve of the earth has major consequences. And in a similar way, the law of the probability lever bends probabilities, with the potential to increase them by huge factors.</li>
<li>The law of near enough says that events that are sufficiently similar may be regarded as identical. No two measurements are identical to an infinite number of decimal places, but in the real world, measurements are often so close that we regard them as the same. The probability that there will be a dead heat in a race depends on the accuracy of our stopwatch.</li>
