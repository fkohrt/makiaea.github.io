<h1>chance</h1>
<h2>any door can be one that changes our fate. any decision, any path</h2>
<h2>role of chance and luck</h2>
<p>not to judge someone by their achievements as we do not know their circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>just because we are still here does not show anything about how well we have done or do. it just means we haven't failed yet and are still here to say something about it — otherwise we wouldn't. this concept of luck rather than destiny is particularly hard to understand if you have lived only a privileged life, unless you have kept or relearned empathy for hardship, for suffering. actually, most people have suffered, but some have forgotten what they learned from it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>scattershot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scattershot approach to knowledge, all it takes is one thing to be very right and your investment in many things which have not come true yet has already paid off</li>
<li>1/n rule of investment is to invest equally across all opportunities. this works because losses will occur and are spread across many areas but we also give opportunity to the rare chance that has very high return. this is the same whether for financial investments or for evolutionary investments.</li>
<li>so what did i learn? well i made sure not to put all my eggs in one basket, and also not to get my hopes too high. i made sure to approach the whole thing as a learning experience and to appreciate the tools and processes that i created in the process of applying. i made sure to get on with my life in the meantime and not to put too much store by the outcome</li>
<li>it is a mistake to put our hopes on someone being perfect. people are often far from what they would like to be, and to place the burden of our expectation solely on one person is to invite disappointment. this does not mean we don't love them, just that it is wise to keep eggs in more than one basket. if there is something you know a person is not able to do, do not hope that they can suddenly do it when you need them to. make alternative plans so things can still work out.</li>
<li>the more I learn, the more I understand that “there but for the grace of god go I” — even though have been abused as have many others, was “lucky” enough that was moved away from most influences by parental job postings (expat) and that most influences could not follow me as a child (pre–internet) — a scattershot childhood allowed bad influences to wane and good influences to have a chance</li>
<li>scattershot is needed in science, where scarcity of publication and concentrated time and effort investment necessitated by current scientific publication method gives incentive for rose–tinted observations and unwillingness to move on</li>
</ul>
<h2>when the privileged person begins to believe that their situation is due to their merit, then it becomes hard to understand reality.</h2>
<h2>serendipity and world–as–teacher is one of the rewards of this</h2>

<ul>
<li>apparent mismatch between result for smaller time samples and result over entire period</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>improbability principle</h2>
<ul>
<li>The law of inevitability says that something must happen. It says that if you make a complete list of all possible outcomes then one of them must occur. This law is so obvious that we often fail to notice it—just as we normally don’t notice the air we breathe. This law says that even if each of the possible outcomes has a tiny probability of occurring, it’s certain that one of them will: it makes the highly improbable certain.</li>
<li>The law of truly large numbers says that, with a large enough number of opportunities, any outrageous thing is likely to happen. If you throw that handful of dice enough times, eventually they’ll all come up 6’s. It may be highly improbable that any one throw will produce all 6’s, but given enough opportunities it becomes almost unavoidable.</li>
<li>The law of selection says you can make probabilities as high as you like if you choose after the event. My favorite example is painting the targets after the arrows have landed. The effect of selection in that example is evident; it makes the outcome certain. But often it’s not obvious that a selection process is going on. If I select the students who do best in a test, I may not realize that I am also selecting those who are most likely to decline in performance at the next test.</li>
<li>The law of the probability lever says that a slight change in circumstances can have a huge impact on probabilities. We think of the earth as flat where we live, but if we keep going in one direction for long enough, we end up back where we started. The very slight, indeed imperceptible curve of the earth has major consequences. And in a similar way, the law of the probability lever bends probabilities, with the potential to increase them by huge factors.</li>
<li>The law of near enough says that events that are sufficiently similar may be regarded as identical. No two measurements are identical to an infinite number of decimal places, but in the real world, measurements are often so close that we regard them as the same. The probability that there will be a dead heat in a race depends on the accuracy of our stopwatch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>unlikely friendship</h2>
<ul>
<li>interested in the unexpected results of events with small probability but large direct impact on people</li>
<li>for example, if someone you meet is more enthusiastic about the friendship between you than you are, most people's reaction would be to assume they are trying to gain something from you that they couldn't do themselves – otherwise, the thinking goes, why would they be so enthusiastic? surely they should be less enthusiastic if they were self–sufficient? now in 98% of cases, this will be true – which is why people often can rely on it as a rule of thumb. especially in avoiding relationships with abusive and dangerous people. this is very important, and the reason this reaction is the usual one is because it has high survival potential. however, there is the tiny possibility (we guess 2% but it's just a guess) that this reaction is not as appropriate as it usually is. now is it worth modifying our behaviour in order to connect with that 2% worth the risk of dealing with the dangerous and abusive people that this will likely expose us to? again the likelihood for most people is no, it is not worth it, which is why the ordinary behaviour is as we see it. so why are we talking about this today? as you have probably already guessed, the reason is because it is possible to make the connection with those 2% of cases, and that you have already done so.</li>
<li>not only have we already connected with those 2%, but we are a significant part of that 2% ourselves.</li>
<li>the (( )) goes here (tangential to our point but still relevant)</li>
<li>the normal optimum is either to match the level of enthusiasm of your friend or to be slightly more or less enthusiastic and allow your friend to match that level.</li>
<li>however for us it is particularly important to deepen friendship in the time we have available ––– which is shorter than that for 98% if people. (due to the way we live far apart, but in the story this could be because we don't live as long or exist as long in the same world)</li>
<li>so to us, ways of deepening friendship are precious but unfortunately cannot be used with people who are not ready, who are not able to accept or deal with this, for people currently not in the 2%. now it might not be possible to tell who is ready or not, so one approach is to allow an open–ended development which covers both ordinary and the 2%. for example, if you have material accessible to the 2% that they can use to find out more about you (facebook, essays, books) to see what you already share in common, be it hobbies, interests or approaches to life. now it is possible, as we mentioned before, that abusive people will try to use that information too, so we bear this in mind when creating and sharing those materials. also, non–abusive people outside the 2% may well misinterpret that information, and sometimes it might be disheartening that we haven't encountered the 2% who understand and accept us for who we are and how we will grow together instead of what we can do for them or what they might get out of us; sometimes it might be hard to take the negative responses that those outside the 2% give –– after all, if you meet a hundred people and ninety eight don't understand, that may seem a bit much. what we must try to do is to remember the 2% and to keep our hope that we will someday meet.</li>
<li>now as to how we can behave towards that 2%, we can be completely honest with our feelings and opinions, knowing that even if we differ in opinion, not only may we understand the other's point of view, but also that we can accept them no matter how different their point of view may appear at first. we connect to and bond with each other as and when we can and though we might miss individual friends, we have support from other friends while we are apart. at the same time it is good to have ways of calling for help from friends near and far when we need it. also we can sometimes be too absorbed in work and so need to remember to spend time bonding with friends.</li>
<li>so aside from being happily absorbed in our own work, or joint work, we are happy bonding with friends.</li>
<li>we are enthusiastic about friendship and can be straightforwardly so because we have no ulterior motive</li>
<li>((</li>
<li>now before talk further about why this is, let's take a precautionary step back, and ask –– where are we going with this? this is an especially important question to ask because when 98% of speakers (to guess at another figure) want you to agree with them for some reason, an easy way for them to do this is to say how especially important you are. abusive people very often use this because it is highly effective – for example, to get someone to buy something, to distract attention from abuse, or to get someone to join a cult. so what guarantees are there that this is not the same as that? you will have to decide for yourself, but let us add that any saying or speech can be used for abusive purposes so it is up to you and your friends to protect yourselves and each other.</li>
<li>the very next step is often to deny any connection with abuse etc. and to say that we are aiming for general ideals, principles, world welfare, improving lives, and so on; you can imagine it for yourself. some kind of technique to get people hooked, a kind of spell to enchant them.</li>
<li>that is a topic we shall deal with in more detail later in the course, for now let us return to the topic at hand, connection to the 2%.</li>
<li>))</li>
<li>it just so happens that we are self–sufficient yet enthusiastic –– we are among that 2%.</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>black swan</em></h2>
<p>on the influence of rare, important, unpredictable events.</p>
<h2>the bad things that people do to you, to each other, to the world — we really do not understand what we do… if we did truly understand, we would not do these things. bad things that people do to you — mostly they do not know even who you are, or are acting on an image they have of you, not who you truly are. this is because our society and culture has not evolved yet to deal with our reality. so too the good things that people do — it may be that we mostly do them without understanding what we are truly doing, and any good consequences too are just luck rather than the result of understanding. by this reasoning, we cannot take credit for the good things we do, nor the blame for the bad things we do — we still as children, not understanding the consequences of what we do, of how we live our lives.</h2>

<h2>life / goes / on, no one gets rehearsal</h2>
<p>life / goes / on, through everyday reversal<br />
with each new dawn, every day is full of chances<br />
to find some good before it’s gone</p>
<p>☆you never know / which way a day is going to take you<br />
　there’s always some surprise / that comes along to shake you<br />
　a simple rule of thumb, that’s often been neglected<br />
　is take life as it comes, expect the unexpected</p>
<p>★you never see / exactly where the road will lead you<br />
　and when it comes to love, you gamble when you need to<br />
　you’ll maybe break your heart, on one unlucky throw<br />
　but then again, you never know</p>
<p>who / knows / why / anything can happen<br />
a cloudy sky / can suddenly break open<br />
before your eyes, there’s the smiling face of summer<br />
chasing all the rain away</p>
<p>☆,★repeat</p>
<p>i never saw / exactly where the road would lead me<br />
one day, i woke / to find somebody needs me<br />
i thought i’d taken luck / as far as it would go<br />
but then again, you never know</p>

<h2>alone for a while / i’ve been searching through the dark</h2>
<p>for traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart<br />
a mosaic / of / the pieces that remain<br />
a melody of life / love lost’s refrain</p>
<p>our paths they did cross / though we cannot say just why<br />
we met / we laughed / we held on fast / and then we said goodbye<br />
to weave a fabric for fables yet untold<br />
let them ring out loud as they unfold</p>
<p>in my dearest memories / i see you reaching out to me<br />
though you’re gone, i still remember that you called / out my name</p>
<p>☆a voice from the past / joining yours and mine<br />
　adding to the layers of harmony<br />
　and so it goes, on and on<br />
　melodies of life,<br />
　to the sky beyond the soaring birds<br />
　forever and ever</p>
<p>so far and away, see the birds as they fly by<br />
soaring through the shadows / of the clouds up in the sky<br />
i have laid my memories and dreams upon those wings<br />
leave them now and see what tomorrow brings</p>
<p>in your dearest memories / do you remember loving me?<br />
was it fate / that brought us close and now leaves / me behind?</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>if i should leave / this lonely world behind<br />
a voice will still remember our harmonies<br />
now i know we’ll carry on<br />
melodies of life<br />
entwine and bond deep in our hearts<br />
as long as we remember</p>
