<h2>Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state</h2>
<h2>Francis A. Macdonald</h2>
<h2><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aav5300">dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aav5300</a></h2>

<h2>each of the last three major ice ages were preceded by tropical &quot;arc-continent collisions&quot; -- tectonic pileups that occurred near the Earth's equator, in which oceanic plates rode up over continental plates, exposing tens of thousands of kilometers of oceanic rock to a tropical environment.</h2>
<p>The scientists say that the heat and humidity of the tropics likely triggered a chemical reaction between the rocks and the atmosphere. Specifically, the rocks' calcium and magnesium reacted with atmospheric carbon dioxide, pulling the gas out of the atmosphere and permanently sequestering it in the form of carbonates such as limestone.</p>
<p>Over time, the researchers say, this weathering process, occurring over millions of square kilometers, could pull enough carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to cool temperatures globally and ultimately set off an ice age.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that arc-continent collisions at low latitudes are the trigger for global cooling,&quot; says Oliver Jagoutz, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. &quot;This could occur over 1-5 million square kilometers, which sounds like a lot. But in reality, it's a very thin strip of Earth, sitting in the right location, that can change the global climate.&quot;</p>
<p>Jagoutz' co-authors are Francis Macdonald and Lorraine Lisiecki of UC Santa Barbara, and Nicholas Swanson-Hysell and Yuem Park of UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>A tropical trigger</p>
<p>When an oceanic plate pushes up against a continental plate, the collision typically creates a mountain range of newly exposed rock. The fault zone along which the oceanic and continental plates collide is called a &quot;suture.&quot; Today, certain mountain ranges such as the Himalayas contain sutures that have migrated from their original collision points, as continents have shifted over millenia.</p>
<p>In 2016, Jagoutz and his colleagues retraced the movements of two sutures that today make up the Himalayas. They found that both sutures stemmed from the same tectonic migration. Eighty million years ago, as the supercontinent known as Gondwana moved north, part of the landmass was crushed against Eurasia, exposing a long line of oceanic rock and creating the first suture; 50 million years ago, another collision between the supercontinents created a second suture.</p>
<p>The team found that both collisions occurred in tropical zones near the equator, and both preceded global atmospheric cooling events by several million years -- which is nearly instantaneous on a geologic timescale. After looking into the rates at which exposed oceanic rock, also known as ophiolites, could react with carbon dioxide in the tropics, the researchers concluded that, given their location and magnitude, both sutures could have indeed sequestered enough carbon dioxide to cool the atmosphere and trigger both ice ages.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they found that this process was likely responsible for ending both ice ages as well. Over millions of years, the oceanic rock that was available to react with the atmosphere eventually eroded away, replaced with new rock that took up far less carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>&quot;We showed that this process can start and end glaciation,&quot; Jagoutz says. &quot;Then we wondered, how often does that work? If our hypothesis is correct, we should find that for every time there's a cooling event, there are a lot of sutures in the tropics.&quot;</p>
<p>Exposing Earth's sutures</p>
<p>The researchers looked to see whether ice ages even further back in Earth's history were associated with similar arc-continent collisions in the tropics. They performed an extensive literature search to compile the locations of all the major suture zones on Earth today, and then used a computer simulation of plate tectonics to reconstruct the movement of these suture zones, and the Earth's continental and oceanic plates, back through time. In this way, they were able to pinpoint approximately where and when each suture originally formed, and how long each suture stretched.</p>
<p>They identified three periods over the last 540 million years in which major sutures, of about 10,000 kilometers in length, were formed in the tropics. Each of these periods coincided with each of three major, well-known ice ages, in the Late Ordovician (455 to 440 million years ago), the Permo-Carboniferous (335 to 280 million years ago), and the Cenozoic (35 million years ago to present day). Importantly, they found there were no ice ages or glaciation events during periods when major suture zones formed outside of the tropics.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that every time there was a peak in the suture zone in the tropics, there was a glaciation event,&quot; Jagoutz says. &quot;So every time you get, say, 10,000 kilometers of sutures in the tropics, you get an ice age.&quot;</p>
<p>He notes that a major suture zone, spanning about 10,000 kilometers, is still active today in Indonesia, and is possibly responsible for the Earth's current glacial period and the appearance of extensive ice sheets at the poles.</p>
<p>This tropical zone includes some of the largest ophiolite bodies in the world and is currently one of the most efficient regions on Earth for absorbing and sequestering carbon dioxide. As global temperatures are climbing as a result of human-derived carbon dioxide, some scientists have proposed grinding up vast quantities of ophiolites and spreading the minerals throughout the equatorial belt, in an effort to speed up this natural cooling process.</p>
<p>But Jagoutz says the act of grinding up and transporting these materials could produce additional, unintended carbon emissions. And it's unclear whether such measures could make any significant impact within our lifetimes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a challenge to make this process work on human timescales,&quot; Jagoutz says. &quot;The Earth does this in a slow, geological process that has nothing to do with what we do to the Earth today. And it will neither harm us, nor save us.&quot;</p>
<h2>On multi-million-year timescales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown if transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in CO2 sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by uplifting and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice-sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.</h2>
<h2>Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings</h2>

<h2>analyzed how neighboring trees influence the growth and survival of nine coexisting species of the tree genus Inga in the Panama rainforest. They compared tree traits for resource acquisition, anti-herbivore defenses and the herbivores that live on the plants. They found that neighboring trees were basically the same in terms of acquiring resources, but had very different defenses and herbivores. Indeed, the defensive traits and shared pests impacted growth and survival, while resource acquisition traits had no effect on the plants' success. These findings indicate that anything impacting pest populations, such as climate change or habitat fragmentation, will have an impact on the health of the rainforest.</h2>
<p>&quot;Working in these hyper-diverse tropical rainforests makes it abundantly clear just how complex the web of interacting species really is. No species or individual lives in isolation. At all levels within the food chain species are competing with one another for precious resources and contributing a huge amount of their energy to defending themselves from the barrage of enemies they face, said Dale Forrister, doctoral candidate in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Utah and lead author of the study. &quot;We are excited about this study because it highlights some of the important ways these antagonistic interactions might influence tropical diversity.&quot;</p>
<p>This study published on March 14, 2019, in the journal Science.</p>
<p>It's a jungle out there</p>
<p>The team conducted their analysis over five years within a 50-hectare forest plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The site has growth and survival data for over 423,000 trees from a previous long-term study. The researchers analyzed every individual tree sapling from the focal Inga species and calculated the similarity of their Inga neighbors' traits within a 10-meter &quot;neighborhood.&quot; They measured four resource acquisition traits, five anti-herbivore defenses and recorded which herbivores were eating which plants.</p>
<p>Forrister developed a complicated model to determine how neighboring trees influence sapling growth and survival. They found that resource acquisition traits had no effect on survival, while defensive traits and herbivores had a big impact.</p>
<p>There are only so many ways to acquire resources. Defensive traits, however, are nearly endless. Plants and herbivores are in a constant arms race to outsmart each other. Plants develop traits to deter hungry mandibles, and herbivores adapt to deal with the leaf's defenses. The Inga genus has a quiver of anti-herbivore traits, including tiny hairs, nectar cups that attract pugnacious ant protectors, and most notably, leaves filled with poisonous compounds. Each Inga species can make hundreds or sometimes thousands of different toxins.</p>
<p>&quot;People may think of a jungle like it's a giant salad bowl. It should be paradise for pests because they're surrounded by leaves. But plants have an infinite number of defense combinations -- half the weight of a young leaf is poison,&quot; said Phyllis Coley, Distinguished Professor of Biology at the University of Utah, research affiliate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and co-author of the study. &quot;As a consequence of the diversity of defenses, each species of herbivore can only eat a few species of plants that they have adaptations for.&quot;</p>
<p>Closely related plants have similar defensive traits, and therefore similar pests. If a plant differs from its neighbor in terms of defenses, their herbivores aren't a threat, Coley continued. &quot;You'll have your own herbivores, but at least you won't have all the critters in the neighborhood eating you.&quot;</p>
<p>Confounding chemical compounds</p>
<p>Plant toxins are the most important weapons for tropical plants, but testing the similarity of each species' chemicals proved problematic. Over five years, the researchers collected leaf samples in the field, dried them in a makeshift desiccator suitcase (no easy feat in 100 percent humidity) and then brought them to the U for analysis. Using high performance liquid chromatography, they separated all of the distinct compounds inside the leaves. However, only 4 percent of the Inga compounds were known to science. So, the team got creative and came up with a new metric. They used a mass spectrometer to determine the chemical structure of each compound, and established that compounds with similar structures were likely affecting herbivores in a similar way.</p>
<p>&quot;Metabolomics, a relatively new field of science, offers scientist a powerful new toolbox for examining the vast amount of chemical diversity that exists out there. Chemicals play a huge role in nature, from defenses to communication they are the medium by which species interact. Being able to quantify this in a meaningful way provides a truly unique perspective,&quot; said Forrister.</p>
<p>But do the herbivores &quot;care&quot; about the traits the team was measuring and do Inga species with similar traits share herbivores? To test this, they collected caterpillars that were eating Inga leaves and sequenced their DNA to classify each as species A, species B, etc. They were unable to name the species because most of the caterpillars were new to science. They cataloged which herbivores were eating which plants, correlated the suite of compounds in the plants and inferred which plant species shared herbivore communities.</p>
<p>Both old-school field research and modern techniques were indispensable to this project's success.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, there's no substitute for spending months and months in the rainforest,&quot; said Coley. &quot;It took us several years to collect data, and samples of leaves and herbivores. It's hot, humid and buggy, but attempting to understand the diversity of species is a biologist's dream.&quot;</p>
<p>The study reveals the significant role of herbivores in driving diversity in tropical ecosystems, with stark implications -- the loss of those populations could have catastrophic consequence on these important habitats.</p>
<p>&quot;If climate change continues to increase the length of the dry season in the Americas, then the dynamics of the herbivore populations will change as well,&quot; said Coley. &quot;That could have implications down the road.&quot;</p>
<h2>Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.</h2>
<h2>Thanking, apologizing, bragging, and blaming: Responsibility exchange theory and the currency of communication</h2>
<h2>Shereen J. Chaudhry, George Loewenstein</h2>
<h2><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rev0000139">dx.doi.org/10.1037/rev0000139</a></h2>

<h2>a framework, &quot;Responsibility Exchange Theory,&quot; for understanding why thanking and apologizing, as well as bragging and blaming, matter so much, and presents novel experimental studies that reveal the psychology underlying these communications.</h2>
<p>&quot;All four of these communications are tools used to transfer responsibility from one person to another,&quot; said Shereen J. Chaudhry, who conducted the research while a Ph.D. student in CMU's Department of Social and Decision Sciences. &quot;They relay information about credit or blame, and they involve image-based trade-offs between appearing competent and appearing warm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our framework helps to make sense of diverse body of research documenting the importance of these forms of communications,&quot; said co-author George Loewenstein, the Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Economics and Psychology at CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. &quot;Research has shown that these communications -- and their absence -- can make or break relationships and affect material outcomes ranging from restaurant tips to medical malpractice settlements.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers proposed that, for the communicator, all four types of communications involve a trade-off between projecting competence and projecting warmth. Thanking and apologizing make the speaker appear caring or generous, but usually at the cost of seeming incompetent or weak. The opposite is true of bragging and blaming, which can bolster the speaker's perceived competence and status, but at the cost of seeming selfish or inconsiderate. The recipient of the communication experiences a different impact on their image: Thanking and apologizing elevate both perceived competence and warmth for the recipient, while bragging and blaming decrease both.</p>
<p>&quot;These dynamics capture why thanking and apologizing are touchstones of 'polite' speech in our culture, while blaming and bragging are often considered taboo,&quot; Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>The researchers' framework makes predictions about whether, when and how people will engage in these critical forms of communication. One key prediction is that regardless of whether a person is the favor-doer (transgressor) or favor-recipient (victim), the person will prefer thanking (apologizing) to occur rather than bragging (blaming). As a result, most conversations over credit and blame should result in thanking and apologizing, while bragging and blaming should be relatively rare.</p>
<p>Another prediction focuses on conversational patterns. To facilitate their desired conversational outcomes, people are predicted to engage in techniques that lead the conversation toward thanking and apologizing and away from the other two.</p>
<p>To test these predictions, the researchers conducted a live chat study involving 207 pairs of experimental subjects. The goal was to examine what happens in a conversation between two people where one person receives a favor from the other person. Participants in the study were paired, and partners were informed that they would each work on a task for five minutes. Whoever earned the higher score on the task would determine earnings for both participants, which would be equal.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the subjects, one subject was randomly assigned a much easier task and, in most cases, ended up achieving a higher score that raised payoffs for both players. After completing the tasks and revealing the winner, partners had a live chat for two minutes. The researchers coded these chats for predicted conversational patterns, looking for instances of thanking (of the high scorer by the low scorer), bragging (by the high scorer to the low scorer), and a phenomenon called &quot;prompting,&quot; which is when the high scorer attempts to elicit thanks from the low scorer.</p>
<p>The key prediction was confirmed: The majority of chats involved thanking (68 percent) whereas bragging appeared in only a minority (14 percent). While the researchers predict that this will almost always be the conversational result, they also predict that thankers will do so more begrudgingly in some cases compared to others. In a separate scenario-based study, participants reported being more reluctant to thank and apologize when they were in an environment in which it was more important to appear competent. In these cases, participants preferred neither person say anything about the credit or blame at stake.</p>
<p>The researchers also found support for subtle conversational phenomena such as prompting. When losers in the chat study weren't forthcoming with gratitude for the winners, 59 percent of those winners steered the conversation in a way to elicit a &quot;thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Chaudhry explains prompting in the context of taking time to provide a colleague with feedback on their report: &quot;If you are a person who wants to be acknowledged for your effort, and if you haven't heard back from that colleague, you might ask, 'Did you find my feedback useful?'&quot;</p>
<p>The chats also had downstream consequences. After chatting, participants were confronted with a similar second task that they could decide to work on with the same or a different partner. There was a second set of pairs doing the experiment that did not get to chat. When compared to those who did not chat, those given an opportunity to chat were much more likely to choose to work together again. This positive effect of chatting is likely related to what happened during the chats: almost all of the chats involved instances of thanking and very few involved bragging. Although it was a competence-based task, a low-scoring partner was more likely to be chosen for the team again if they projected a warmer image.</p>
<p>Responsibility Exchange Theory can help to explain a wide range of commonly observed phenomena. It helps to explain why some communications that might appear to be apologies, but which don't accept responsibility -- &quot;I'm sorry you feel that I hurt you&quot; -- are not accepted as authentic. In addition, it explains why thanking and apologizing are much less likely to occur after the other side has bragged or blamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Our theory also can shed light on why, as previous research has found, women tend to apologize more than men. Society often imposes a 'warmth premium' on women, making it more important for them to be perceived of as warm as opposed to competent,&quot; Chaudhry said.</p>
<h2>From the time we are children, we are taught to say “thank you” and “I’m sorry.” These communications are central to many social interactions, and the failure to say them often leads to conflict in relationships. Research has documented that, alongside the impact they can have on relationships, apologies and thanks can also impact material outcomes as small as restaurant tips and as significant as settlements of medical malpractice lawsuits. But, it is trivial to utter the words; how can such “cheap talk” carry so much value? In this article, we propose a “responsibility exchange theory” that explains why these communications are not costless, and which draws connections between four forms of communication that have not previously been connected: thanking, apologizing, bragging, and blaming. All four of these communications relay information about credit or blame, and thus introduce image-based costs and benefits for both the communicator and the recipient of communication: Each of the four communications involves a tradeoff between appearing competent and appearing warm. By formalizing these social psychological insights with a utility-based approach to modeling communication, and by applying game theoretic analysis, we offer new insights about social communication. We test several of the model’s novel predictions about strategic communication in two experiments: The first involves hypothetical choices in a scenario study, and the second involves real choices in a live interaction. We end with a discussion of the theory’s place in the literature and consider extended predictions and applications as examples of future directions for research</h2>

<h2>While the teeth of humans used to meet in an edge-to-edge bite due to their harder and tougher diet at the time, more recent softer foods allowed modern humans to retain the juvenile overbite that had previously disappeared by adulthood, with the upper teeth slightly more in front than the lower teeth. This shift led to the rise of a new class of speech sounds now found in half of the world's languages: labiodentals, or sounds made by touching the lower lip to the upper teeth, for example when pronouncing the letter &quot;f.&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;In Europe, our data suggests that the use of labiodentals has increased dramatically only in the last couple of millennia, correlated with the rise of food processing technology such as industrial milling,&quot; explains Steven Moran, one of the two co-first authors of the study. &quot;The influence of biological conditions on the development of sounds has so far been underestimated.&quot;</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary approach to verify hypothesis</p>
<p>The project was inspired by an observation made by linguist Charles Hockett back in 1985. Hockett noticed that languages that foster labiodentals are often found in societies with access to softer foods. &quot;But there are dozens of superficial correlations involving language which are spurious, and linguistic behavior, such as pronunciation, doesn't fossilize,&quot; says co-first author Damián Blasi.</p>
<p>In order to unravel the mechanisms underlying the observed correlations, the scientists combined insights, data and methods from across the sciences, including biological anthropology, phonetics and historical linguistics. &quot;It was a rare case of consilience across disciplines,&quot; says Blasi. What made the project possible was the availability of newly developed, large datasets, detailed biomechanical simulation models, and computationally intensive methods of data analysis, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Listening in on the past</p>
<p>&quot;Our results shed light on complex causal links between cultural practices, human biology and language,&quot; says Balthasar Bickel, project leader and UZH professor. &quot;They also challenge the common assumption that, when it comes to language, the past sounds just like the present.&quot; Based on the findings of the study and the new methods it developed, linguists can now tackle a host of unsolved questions, such as how languages actually sounded thousands of years ago. Did Caesar say &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot; -- or was it more like &quot;weni, widi, wici'&quot;?</p>

<h2>&quot;Frogs emit a pungent odor. Sometimes a particular species can be recognized by its scent, but until now, the function of this odor was unknown. It was typically assumed to be an aposematic smell, meaning a chemical warning sign that served to repel predators, as in the case of skunks [Mephitis mephitis] among mammals, for example,&quot; said Célio Haddad, a professor at São Paulo State University's Rio Claro Bioscience Institute (IBRC-UNESP) in Brazil and a coauthor of the article.</h2>
<p>According to Haddad, who is also affiliated with the university's Aquaculture Center (CAUNESP) in Jaboticabal, this hypothesis was considered plausible because many amphibian species, especially when poisonous, are brightly colored, and this serves as a visual alert to frighten predators. &quot;We thought odor might play a similar role among anurans [frogs and toads],&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new study resulted from the postdoctoral research of Argentinean biologist Andrés Eduardo Brunetti, supervised by Professor Norberto Peporine Lopes. Conducted at the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP-USP), the research was supported by FAPESP.</p>
<p>&quot;The importance and originality of Brunetti's research is that for the first time it shows a pronounced difference in the odors emitted by frogs of opposite sexes,&quot; Haddad said. &quot;No other studies of anurans have ever described this type of behavior. The results suggest that the odor serves to permit mutual recognition between males and females of the same species for mating purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>The research was also supported by the FAPESP Research Program on Biodiversity Characterization, Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use (BIOTA-FAPESP) and by the University of São Paulo (USP), the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Brazil's Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES).</p>
<p>&quot;In anurans, you often see different species sharing a lake or marsh. In such places, there are 30 male frogs for every female of the same species on average. The question is how the females recognize males of their own species among a multitude of males belonging to several species while they're all vocalizing at the same time,&quot; Brunetti said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's well-known that the function of the call of anuran males is to attract females and that every species has a characteristic song. Our findings suggest that odor appears to play a similar role, serving as an olfactory signal that enables females to recognize males of their own species.&quot;</p>
<p>Biologists were also unaware of a difference in the scents of male and female frogs. Brunetti discovered this difference during his research, whose primary goal was to understand the chemical composition of the volatile components emitted by the skin of various frog species.</p>
<p>His working hypothesis suggested that smell was a chemical warning sign that served to repel predators. To verify the hypothesis, Brunetti conducted field surveys at several sites in São Paulo state and Rio de Janeiro state, collecting specimens of the tree frog Boana prasina.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard to collect females in the wild. Initially, we managed to collect only males. When we noticed what appeared to be a sexual difference in their odors, I went into the field again with the specific aim of capturing females for comparison,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;During my doctoral research at the Argentinian Natural Science Museum in Buenos Aires, while investigating the volatile compounds in two other frog species, I discovered that the secretions were made up of a blend of 35 to 42 compounds in nine different chemical classes. We then realized that some of the compounds had the specific signature of compounds produced by bacteria.&quot;</p>
<p>Brunetti came to Brazil to investigate whether the selected tree frogs had skin bacteria that produced the characteristic odor of each species, and if so, which compounds they produced. His laboratory research proceeded on two fronts: analysis of the volatile compounds released by the skin of these frogs and identification of the bacteria on their skin.</p>
<p>Brunetti and colleagues used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to analyze the diversity of the volatile components secreted by the skin of B. prasina. They found that adult males and females secrete a blend of 60-80 compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, alkenes, ethers, ketones, methoxypyrazines, terpenes and thioethers.</p>
<p>The compounds were exactly the same in both males and females, but the researchers were surprised to find a pronounced sexual difference in the levels of methoxypyrazines, terpenes, and thioethers.</p>
<p>&quot;These three components were responsible for the difference between males and females. Thioethers and methoxypyrazines are typically produced by microorganisms,&quot; Brunetti said.</p>
<p>They decided to determine whether microorganisms were the source of these compounds in B. prasina. To do so, they isolated, cultivated and identified bacteria associated with the skin of these frogs and analyzed their volatile components.</p>
<p>No fewer than 128 different components were detected. Analysis of each component revealed that four methoxypyrazines present in males and females were produced by a single bacterium of the genus Pseudomonas.</p>
<p>In B. prasina, Brunetti discovered, methoxypyrazines were much more abundant in females than in males. Two of the four types of methoxypyrazines were measured at higher levels in females, while two were found at higher levels in males.</p>
<p>Symbiotic relationship</p>
<p>&quot;The interesting thing about Pseudomonas sp. is that these bacteria live on the skin of males and females, where they metabolize the same volatile compounds but at different levels of concentration according to the sex of the host,&quot; Brunetti said.</p>
<p>The levels of methoxypyrazine measured in these frogs, he added, suggest the existence of a complex mechanism of metabolic interactions that creates a different environment on the skin of males and females, favoring the synthesis of characteristic methoxypyrazines in each sex.</p>
<p>&quot;These frogs and bacteria have a symbiotic relationship. In exchange for the service provided by the bacteria, entailing sexual differentiation by scent, the frogs provide an environment -- their own skin -- on which the bacteria can proliferate,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>The function of this sexual difference in methoxypyrazine levels is unknown. &quot;However, we assume that the difference in scent helps male frogs of this species recognize females of the same species in places inhabited by other frog species,&quot; Brunetti said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that many anurans use visual communication [bright skin colors] to repel predators as well as acoustic communication [vocalization] to attract female mates. Perhaps B. prasina uses a form of olfactory communication for the same purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Brunetti will attempt to confirm this hypothesis in future research. If correct, it will have major repercussions. &quot;Only one anuran, in Madagascar, is currently known to communicate by odor. Among amphibians, salamanders, which are distant relatives of anurans, are known to use this form of communication,&quot; Haddad said.</p>
<p>&quot;If B. prasina uses scent as a form of communication, it may well be the case that other species also use olfactory communication, given that each species has a characteristic odor. Brunetti's discovery, if confirmed, opens up a new field of investigation in herpetology, which will now focus on olfactory communication among anurans, rather than just visual and acoustic communication.&quot;</p>
<h2>Amphibians are known to possess a wide variety of compounds stored in their skin glands. While significant progress has been made in understanding the chemical diversity and biological relevance of alkaloids, amines, steroids, and peptides, most aspects of the odorous secretions are completely unknown. In this study, we examined sexual variations in the volatile profile from the skin of the tree frog Boana prasina and combined culture and culture-independent methods to investigate if microorganisms might be a source of these compounds. We found that sesquiterpenes, thioethers, and methoxypyrazines are major contributors to the observed sex differences. We also observed that each sex has a distinct profile of methoxypyrazines, and that the chemical origin of these compounds can be traced to a Pseudomonas sp. strain isolated from the frog’s skin. This symbiotic bacterium was present in almost all individuals examined from different sites and was maintained in captive conditions, supporting its significance as the source of methoxypyrazines in these frogs. Our results highlight the potential relevance of bacteria as a source of chemical signals in amphibians and contribute to increasing our understanding of the role that symbiotic associations have in animals.</h2>
<h2>nearly 61,000 microbial genomes that were computationally reconstructed from 3,810 publicly available human gut metagenomes, which are datasets of all the genetic material present in a microbiome sample. The metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) included 2,058 previously unknown species, thereby bringing the number of known human gut species to 4,558 and increasing the phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria by 50 percent.</h2>
<p>A model community for large-scale culturing efforts</p>
<p>This work helps answer the question of why certain microbes have not been cultivated in the lab. Scientists have previously used metagenomics and single-cell genomics to discern the specific metabolic capabilities of uncultured microbes present in environmental samples. &quot;However, many environmental communities are poorly studied, so it's not clear whether or not uncultivated organisms are really uncultivable,&quot; said Stephen Nayfach, a scientist in Berkeley Lab's Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology (EGSB) division and the study's first author. &quot;The human gut, in contrast, is intensely studied with many large-scale culturing efforts, which suggests that the many of the 'wild,' uncultivated species in the human gut are difficult to culture using current approaches.&quot;</p>
<p>By comparing the reconstructed genomes of uncultivated species versus those that have been cultivated, the team found that uncultivated species' genomes are roughly 20 percent smaller, on average, and are missing numerous pathways for biosynthesis of fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins. &quot;Genes that are commonly missing from uncultivated gut bacteria may point towards important growth factors that have been overlooked in previous culture-based studies,&quot; Nayfach said.</p>
<p>Improving genomic resources for global populations</p>
<p>With the help of a new tool called IGGsearch, the team compared the microbiomes of people with 10 different diseases to those of healthy individuals and found that nearly 40 percent of microbe-disease associations involve a species that did not previously have a genome. &quot;These disease links used to be invisible or hard to detect,&quot; said Katie Pollard, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes and Biohub, and contributing author on the study.</p>
<p>One new species in the Negativicutes class, for example, was strongly depleted in people with the spinal inflammatory condition ankylosing spondylitis (AS). &quot;As an AS patient, I am thrilled that we are finally gaining a more complete picture of how the microbiome changes in this disease,&quot; she added. Additionally, the team used IGGsearch microbiome profiles to build predictive models for disease and found that prediction accuracy was &quot;significantly improved&quot; compared to existing tools that primarily quantified the abundance of cultivated species.</p>
<p>Pollard, who is also a professor at UC San Francisco, added that, until now, microbiome genomic resources have been particularly sparse for individuals living outside North America, Europe, or China. &quot;By assembling genomes from metagenomes of diverse people, we have helped to close this gap,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Extending technologies across microbiome areas</p>
<p>EGSB senior scientist and team lead Nikos Kyrpides said that several of the computational methods and analyses Nayfach developed for this research are currently being used to enable one of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) groundbreaking projects: analyzing a massive collection of other JGI-sequenced MAGs from diverse environments. He added that this type of analysis hinges on several critical factors: the availability of the microbiome data; the availability of the sequence data in public archives; and the lack of any data utilization restrictions from the community, as referenced in a recent Science policy paper on which he and Katie Pollard are co-authors.</p>

<h2>Largely due to challenges cultivating microbes under laboratory conditions, the genome sequence of many species in the human gut microbiome remains unknown. To address this problem, we reconstructed 60,664 prokaryotic draft genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes from geographically and phenotypically diverse human subjects. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 previously unknown species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing a 50% increase in the phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, new OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for new OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction with loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.</h2>

<h2>The popularity of ball pits has increased since mainstream commercial restaurants installed them nationwide for children in the 1980s, and they are often found to be contaminated with visible dirt, vomit, feces, or urine, providing a permissive environment for contamination. Similar ball pits are commonly used in pediatric physical therapy to provide stimulation to children with sensory or motor impairments. According to the study, clinics may go days or even weeks between cleanings, allowing time for microorganisms to accumulate and grow to levels capable of giving children infections and making them sick.</h2>
<p>Investigators from the University of North Georgia examined six ball pits located in inpatient physical therapy clinics or outpatient clinics in the state of Georgia. Nine to 15 balls were randomly selected from different depths of each sampled ball pit.</p>
<p>The study found considerable microbial colonization in ball pits that were tested, including eight bacteria and one yeast that could cause disease. Bacterial colonization was found to be as high as thousands of cells per ball, clearly demonstrating an increased potential for transmission of these organisms to patients and an increased possibility of infection.</p>
<p>&quot;We found considerable variation in the number of microorganisms between the different ball pit samples,&quot; said the study's lead researcher Mary Ellen Oesterle, EdD, PT, Department of Physical Therapy, University of North Georgia, Dahlonega, GA, USA. &quot;This suggests that clinics utilize different protocols for cleaning and maintenance, potentially representing a broader need to clarify and establish standards that reduce the risk of transmission.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, researchers identified 31 bacterial species and one species of yeast. The human-associated bacteria found in the ball pits included:</p>
<p>Enterococcus faecalis, which can cause endocarditis, septicemia, urinary tract infection, and meningitis;<br />
Staphylococcus hominis, a cause of bloodstream infections and reported as a cause of sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit;<br />
Streptococcus oralis, known to cause endocarditis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and streptococcal shock;<br />
Acinetobacter lwofii, which has been reported to cause septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, and urinary tract and skin infections.<br />
&quot;This research shows that ball pits may pose an infection hazard,&quot; said 2019 APIC President Karen Hoffmann, RN, MS, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC. &quot;Facilities should establish a program for regular cleaning to protect patients and healthcare workers from potential infection risks.&quot;</p>
<h2>Clinical, therapeutic ball pits commonly used by physical therapists to provide sensory stimulation to children were investigated for microbial colonization. Due to the permissive and hospitable environment provided by these ball pits, microorganisms can accumulate to levels that increase the ease of transmission to exposed individuals. Our study found considerable microbial colonization in ball pits located in clinical settings, including 8 opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and 1 opportunistic pathogenic yeast.</h2>
<h2>The popularity of ball pits has increased in the general population since commercial restaurant chains installed them nationwide in the 1980s. Ball pits are often contaminated with visible dirt, vomit, feces, or urine providing an origin and permissive environmental factors for microbial contamination. Numerous types of bacteria have been identified in ball pits located in community settings, including normal human skin bacteria, as well as opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and various enteric bacteria. Besides human-associated microorganisms, some ball pits have been found to contain zoonotic-associated organisms that have also been identified as causing serious infections in humans, including Pasteurella multocida.1</h2>
<p>Ball pits are also commonly used in pediatric physical therapy to help provide stimulation to children with sensory and motor impairments. Currently, identification of national standards, or protocols, for cleaning these enclosures and their contents remains elusive. Accordingly, clinics may go days or even weeks between cleanings, which may allow time for microorganisms to accumulate and grow to levels capable of transmission and infection. This risk increases if the individual has skin lesions or abrasions, providing a portal of entry for immunocompromised individuals in general.</p>
<p>To ascertain the level of microbial colonization or presence in therapeutic ball pits at any given time, regardless of cleaning procedures, we conducted a study on 6 clinical ball pits located in community clinics. The goal of this study was to determine if there was a difference in the amount of bacteria found between each clinic and to identify the microorganisms found in the ball pits.</p>

<h2>Historically, the generally taught scientific premise has been that each gene has one unique start site and is responsible for the creation of only one protein. However, the study, which is published in Molecular Cell, a leading journal on the topic of cellular processes, shows that some genes have more than one start site and can specify production of more than one functional protein.</h2>
<p>Their method of identifying gene start sites relies on a common prescription drug called retapamulin, a topical antibiotic. Retapamulin, they showed for the first time, works by causing the ribosome, which reads genetic code, to become stalled at these start sites, inhibiting translation, a key part of the process by which the genetic code in DNA is used to create proteins.</p>
<p>UIC's Alexander Mankin and Nora Vázquez-Laslop led the research, which looked at E. coli cells in response to retapamulin in in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p>
<p>&quot;First, we understood the antibiotic's mechanism and then we applied that knowledge to identify the special 'start' gene signals the cell uses to regulate protein synthesis,&quot; said Mankin, the Alexander Neyfahk Professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at the UIC College of Pharmacy. &quot;In the past, these start codons were identified by rather difficult processes -- proteins often needed to be isolated and studied to discover where the start sites of their genes are located in the bacterial genome. Now, in a single experiment, we can profile the starts of all the thousands of bacterial genes in a more forward manner.&quot;</p>
<p>Mankin and Vázquez-Laslop say using retapamulin to aid in bacterial gene translation profiling opens many new avenues for research.</p>
<p>Using the antibiotic, the researchers from Mankin and Vázquez-Laslop's lab, which included Sezen Meydan, James Marks, Dorota Klepacki and Amira Kefi, were able to identify &quot;cryptic,&quot; or alternative start sites within some bacterial genes.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw that many previously hidden proteins were initiated at sites in the middle of the gene and that those proteins were functional and that initiation at alternative start sites is widespread in bacteria,&quot; said Vázquez-Laslop, research professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy at the UIC College of Pharmacy and the Center for Biomolecular Sciences.</p>
<p>The researchers found more than 100 E. coli genes, out of around 4,000, that could initiate protein synthesis at more than one site.</p>
<p>&quot;Proteins initiated at these unknown sites may constitute a previously hidden fraction of the proteome -- the entire set of proteins that can be expressed -- in bacteria and their initiation at these sites may play a role in the life of the cell,&quot; said Mankin, who is also director of the Center for Biomolecular Science. &quot;By better understanding the cell and the mechanisms of antibiotic action, we can apply that knowledge to learn more about what makes bacteria become pathogenic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can also apply that knowledge to better understand how to prevent or stop bacteria from causing harm,&quot; Vázquez-Laslop said.</p>

<p>Summary<br />
The use of alternative translation initiation sites enables production of more than one protein from a single gene, thereby expanding the cellular proteome. Although several such examples have been serendipitously found in bacteria, genome-wide mapping of alternative translation start sites has been unattainable. We found that the antibiotic retapamulin specifically arrests initiating ribosomes at start codons of the genes. Retapamulin-enhanced Ribo-seq analysis (Ribo-RET) not only allowed mapping of conventional initiation sites at the beginning of the genes, but strikingly, it also revealed putative internal start sites in a number of Escherichia coli genes. Experiments demonstrated that the internal start codons can be recognized by the ribosomes and direct translation initiation in vitro and in vivo. Proteins, whose synthesis is initiated at internal in-frame and out-of-frame start sites, can be functionally important and contribute to the “alternative” bacterial proteome. The internal start sites may also play regulatory roles in gene expression.</p>
