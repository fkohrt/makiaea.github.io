<p><em>observation of a discrete time crystal</em><br />

<li>Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics, including cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref1">2</a>. An example is the breaking of spatial translational symmetry, which underlies the formation of crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Using the analogy of crystals in space, the breaking of translational symmetry in time and the emergence of a ‘time crystal’ was recently proposed<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref2">3</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref3">4</a>, but was later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref4">5</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref5">6</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref6">7</a>. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems, which are subject to a periodic drive, can exhibit persistent time correlations at an emergent subharmonic frequency<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref7">8</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref8">9</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref9">10</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref10">11</a>. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a ‘discrete time crystal’<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref10">11</a>. Here we present the experimental observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization conditions, and observe a subharmonic temporal response that is robust to external perturbations. The observation of such a time crystal opens the door to the study of systems with long-range spatio-temporal correlations and novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7644/full/nature21413.html#ref7">8</a>.</li>

<p><em>time of day differences in neural reward functioning in healthy young men</em><br />
jamie e. m. byrne et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0918-17.2017">dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0918-17.2017</a></p>

<li>Reward function appears to be modulated by the circadian system, but little is known about the neural basis of this interaction. Previous research suggests that the neural reward response may be different in the afternoon; however, the direction of this effect is contentious. Reward response may follow the diurnal rhythm in self-reported positive affect, peaking in the early afternoon. An alternative is that daily reward response represents a type of prediction error, with neural reward activation relatively high at times of day when rewards are unexpected (i.e., early and late in the day). The present study measured neural reward activation in the context of a validated reward task at 10.00 h, 14.00 h, and 19.00 h in healthy human males. A region of interest BOLD fMRI protocol was used to investigate the diurnal waveform of activation in reward-related brain regions. Multilevel modeling found, as expected, a highly significant quadratic time-of-day effect focusing on the left putamen (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Consistent with the “prediction error” hypothesis, activation was significantly higher at 10.00 h and 19.00 h compared with 14.00 h. It is provisionally concluded that the putamen may be particularly important in endogenous priming of reward motivation at different times of day, with the pattern of activation consistent with circadian-modulated reward expectancies in neural pathways (i.e., greater activation to reward stimuli at unexpected times of day). This study encourages further research into circadian modulation of reward and underscores the methodological importance of accounting for time of day in fMRI protocols.</li>

<li>Diurnal gene expression patterns underlie time of the day-specific functional specialization of tissues. However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate <em>Papio anubis</em> (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most of ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk with a “quiescent period” during early night. Our findings also unveil a different temporal organization of central and peripheral tissues between diurnal and nocturnal animals.</li>

<p><em>indoles from commensal bacteria extend healthspan</em><br />

<p>Increases in human life expectancy over the next century will be accompanied by increased frailty and massive and unsustainable health care costs. Developing means to extend the time that individuals remain healthy and free of age-related infirmities, called healthspan, has therefore become a critical goal of aging research. We show that small molecules produced by the microbiota and related to indole extend healthspan in geriatric worms, flies, and mice, without attendant effects on lifespan. Indoles act via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cause animals to retain a youthful gene expression profile. Indoles may represent a new class of therapeutics that improve the way we age as opposed to simply extending how long we live.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have identified conserved genetic pathways and small molecules associated with extension of lifespan in diverse organisms. However, extending lifespan does not result in concomitant extension in healthspan, defined as the proportion of time that an animal remains healthy and free of age-related infirmities. Rather, mutations that extend lifespan often reduce healthspan and increase frailty. The question arises as to whether factors or mechanisms exist that uncouple these processes and extend healthspan and reduce frailty independent of lifespan. We show that indoles from commensal microbiota extend healthspan of diverse organisms, including <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, and mice, but have a negligible effect on maximal lifespan. Effects of indoles on healthspan in worms and flies depend upon the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a conserved detector of xenobiotic small molecules. In <em>C. elegans</em>, indole induces a gene expression profile in aged animals reminiscent of that seen in the young, but which is distinct from that associated with normal aging. Moreover, in older animals, indole induces genes associated with oogenesis and, accordingly, extends fecundity and reproductive span. Together, these data suggest that small molecules related to indole and derived from commensal microbiota act in diverse phyla via conserved molecular pathways to promote healthy aging. These data raise the possibility of developing therapeutics based on microbiota-derived indole or its derivatives to extend healthspan and reduce frailty in humans.</p>

<li>When determining responsibility for harmful actions, people often consider whether the actor behaved intentionally. The spread of surveillance cameras, “on-officer” recording devices, and smart-phone video makes it increasingly likely that such judgments are aided by video replay. Yet, little is known about how different qualities of the video, such as replay speed, affect human judgment. We demonstrate that slow motion replay can systematically increase judgments of intent because it gives viewers the false impression that the actor had more time to premeditate before acting. In legal proceedings, these judgments of intent can mean the difference between life and death. Thus, any benefits of video replay should be weighed against its potentially biasing effects.</li>

<li>the limiting factor in this age is time. we need to deal with the consequences of our ancestors’ actions, and we need to do it fast. change has come in the past when those people who hold power who also hold opinions that are no longer suited to the world–as–it–is pass on that power to a new generation. unfortunately the consequences this time are so huge that it is irresponsible to wait many years for that change to come to pass. the problem is compounded not only by the magnitude of the consequences — damage to the entirety of the earth — but also by the longevity of the people in power — longer than in living memory — and the concentration of that power — more concentrated than in living memory.
<ul>
<li>to achieve this goal it is not necessary to aim for perfection. the tale of the hundredth monkey illustrates this: “there was once a land which had been poisoned by humans, and they wanted to learn how long it would take for life to cover the land once more. ten thousand monkey were made to settle on the land, which bore coconut by the time the ten thousand monkey were settled. however the coconut also bore the poison on their outer husk so that a nut must be first washed in the river afore it were eaten. so they tried to teach the monkey to wash the coconut, and sure enough, at the end of the first day, one little monkey had learned to wash the coconut. at the end of the second day, another two monkey had learned to wash the coconut. and so it continued that each day more and more monkey learned to wash the coconut. but something happened they did not expect. one day, after the hundredth monkey had learned to wash the coconut, they came to the river and saw lined upon the bank many thousand monkey washing coconut. and they were sore confused and said, how had this come to pass?”</li>

<li>“Is a person abusive because of a privileged upbringing, or does a privileged upbringing make a person abusive?” is the sort of nice zero–sum assumption question that may be helpful in creating an argument, but is worthless in working towards a solution. The problem is that generalisation of logic leaves out <em>time</em>, and, specifically, <em>change</em>. Both assertions could be true, at certain times, for certain people — and no longer true at other times, for even the same people.</li>

<li>understanding time is not an alternative to the eternal world view, it is the productive, positive part. when we are infants, and when our faculties dissolve near our ends, we have the eternal world view. it does not produce, it can only consume. but in the prime of our lives, we can choose to produce. unfortunately if we are excessively privileged or abused we never grow into our prime and thus know only to destroy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00667</h2>
<ul>
<li>people often confuse things that apply at a particular time, in a particular context, and believe these are always, universally correct. this is no less true in science as in religion. for example, a scientific study that generalises from several decisions of many individuals, and purports to explain all decisions of individuals, is very likely to be wrong. it may be that some people are open to changing their opinion sometimes, but a study that captures only a few decisions from each individual will not see this.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>time is something we mostly take for granted, like space and air. it is something we rarely try to understand, and so it has become one of our greatest weaknesses.
<ul>
<li>for to understand, even a little, of time, means we understand processes, such as life, a little more clearly.</li>
<li>the power of time is much greater than physical power, it can be accumulative.</li>
<li>the reliance on definition comes in part from a misunderstanding of time. it is assumed that something can be permanent, that the concept of permanence is something useful. similarly with perfection, and the concept of limits.</li>
<li>we will be considering practical applications of the concept of time, rather than certain definitions of it.</li>
<li>i don't believe time exists. nonetheless, many people are beholden to time. so i am not going to talk today about time's existence but rather about what we can do about our relationship with time.</li>
<li>because the two fundamental concepts of time and of change are intimately and inseparably related in our culture, to deal with change is to deal with time.</li>
<li>the illusion of time can be likened to the illusion of space. we are familiar with the illusion of three dimensions transmitted through the medium of an essentially two-dimensional surface, be it paper, or a screen, or an electronic device. with a little thought we can imagine our perception of time in the same way, as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional phenomenon.</li>
<li>now why should we bother with this? i used to believe that if time was not an evolutionarily useful concept it would not be so widely used. but contained in that simple-seeming statement are both a fallacy and a trap. firstly, time, in the way that it was perceived by many people in &quot;western&quot; cultures at the end of the twentieth century, is not the same as it is perceived in other human cultures in the present and the past, and perhaps very different to what is perceived by other organisms. secondly, our definition of time is circular, in that we use it in the very definition we give of it. evolution, useful and concept are all dependent on our definition of time, for example.</li>
<li>well, i say to this, even if our words and present concepts are all we have, let us see what we can do with them.</li>
