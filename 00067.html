<h2>it must have felt cold there in the shadows</h2>
<p>to rarely let sunlight warm your face<br />
you were content to let us shine, that’s your way<br />
you seemed to walk a step behind</p>
<p>we were the ones they heaped with glory<br />
while you were the ones who made our strength<br />
beautiful faces yet unnamed, for so long<br />
beautiful smiles through such pain</p>
<p>did you ever know you are our heroes<br />
and everything we would like to be?<br />
we can fly high with the eagles<br />
for you are the winds who lift our wings</p>
<p>it might have appeared to go unnoticed<br />
but it’s all held here within our hearts<br />
we want you to know: we know the truth, of course we know it<br />
where would we be if not with you</p>
<p>did you ever know you are our heroes?<br />
you’re everything we can hope to be<br />
now we soar high with the eagles<br />
for you are the winds who lift our wings</p>
<p>for you are the wind who gives us wing</p>

<h1>time</h1>
<h2>time is something we mostly take for granted, like space and air. it is something we rarely try to understand, and so it has become one of our greatest weaknesses.</h2>
<ul>
<li>for to understand, even a little, of time, means we understand processes, such as life, a little more clearly.</li>
<li>the power of time is much greater than physical power, it can be accumulative.</li>
<li>the reliance on definition comes in part from a misunderstanding of time. it is assumed that something can be permanent, that the concept of permanence is something useful. similarly with perfection, and the concept of limits.</li>
<li>we will be considering practical applications of the concept of time, rather than certain definitions of it.</li>
<li>i don't believe time exists. nonetheless, many people are beholden to time. so i am not going to talk today about time's existence but rather about what we can do about our relationship with time.</li>
<li>because the two fundamental concepts of time and of change are intimately and inseparably related in our culture, to deal with change is to deal with time.</li>
<li>the illusion of time can be likened to the illusion of space. we are familiar with the illusion of three dimensions transmitted through the medium of an essentially two-dimensional surface, be it paper, or a screen, or an electronic device. with a little thought we can imagine our perception of time in the same way, as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional phenomenon.</li>
<li>now why should we bother with this? i used to believe that if time was not an evolutionarily useful concept it would not be so widely used. but contained in that simple-seeming statement are both a fallacy and a trap. firstly, time, in the way that it was perceived by many people in &quot;western&quot; cultures at the end of the twentieth century, is not the same as it is perceived in other human cultures in the present and the past, and perhaps very different to what is perceived by other organisms. secondly, our definition of time is circular, in that we use it in the very definition we give of it. evolution, useful and concept are all dependent on our definition of time, for example.</li>
<li>well, i say to this, even if our words and present concepts are all we have, let us see what we can do with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>to think not only time but also variation over time and variation of the variation over time — three “dimensions” of time</h2>
<h2>idea of time</h2>
<ul>
<li>not only how things are, but how things were and will be</li>
</ul>
<h2>people often confuse things that apply at a particular time, in a particular context, and believe these are always, universally correct. this is no less true in science as in religion. for example, a scientific study that generalises from several decisions of many individuals, and purports to explain all decisions of individuals, is very likely to be wrong. it may be that some people are open to changing their opinion sometimes, but a study that captures only a few decisions from each individual will not see this.</h2>
<h2>when you expand your mind in this dimension of time, many things become possible, that once seemed impossible.</h2>
<h2>understanding time is not an alternative to the eternal world view, it is the productive, positive part. when we are infants, and when our faculties dissolve near our ends, we have the eternal world view. it does not produce, it can only consume. but in the prime of our lives, we can choose to produce. unfortunately if we are excessively privileged or abused we never grow into our prime and thus know only to destroy.</h2>
<h2>“Is a person abusive because of a privileged upbringing, or does a privileged upbringing make a person abusive?” is the sort of nice zero–sum assumption question that may be helpful in creating an argument, but is worthless in working towards a solution. The problem is that generalisation of logic leaves out <em>time</em>, and, specifically, <em>change</em>. Both assertions could be true, at certain times, for certain people — and no longer true at other times, for even the same people.</h2>
<h2>I may do things you thought I could not do; it is not that I cannot, but that I do not often need to.</h2>
<h2>often missing factor</h2>
<ul>
<li>the problem with writing papers is that to have a significant publishable result you want something that is true always (not only true, as most discussions of the topic address) the always is what concerns us here. variability with time within the same individual is discounted.</li>
<li>case of a scientific study where data collected indicated people born in month of may self–reported as most lucky… data was collected in mid–april. common lack of experimental control for time factors is symptom of wider societal relation to time and change, not individual failing of understanding</li>
</ul>
<h2>time disorder as enabler of emotional disorder: since time perception changes with emotion, emotion can be induced by change in time perception, as we tend to conflate them</h2>
<p>perhaps same mechanism in change in scope, for example anger and narrow scope</p>
<h2>our relation to time and an understanding of how to change it</h2>
<h2>is not about quantity. It is about what we can do with time.</h2>
<h2>most people understand objects well but not processes. especially important to understand time and change.</h2>
<p>for example, entire elaborate theories or objects are built but they don't take account of time, such as the theory of comparative advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li>the theory of comparative advantage (specialising in one task) is rubbish because it does not take time and change into proper account. there is also no account taken of crisis or black swan events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>the limiting factor in this age is time. we need to deal with the consequences of our ancestors’ actions, and we need to do it fast. change has come in the past when those people who hold power who also hold opinions that are no longer suited to the world–as–it–is pass on that power to a new generation. unfortunately the consequences this time are so huge that it is irresponsible to wait many years for that change to come to pass. the problem is compounded not only by the magnitude of the consequences — damage to the entirety of the earth — but also by the longevity of the people in power — longer than in living memory — and the concentration of that power — more concentrated than in living memory.</h2>
<ul>
<li>to achieve this goal it is not necessary to aim for perfection. the tale of the hundredth monkey illustrates this: “there was once a land which had been poisoned by humans, and they wanted to learn how long it would take for life to cover the land once more. ten thousand monkey were made to settle on the land, which bore coconut by the time the ten thousand monkey were settled. however the coconut also bore the poison on their outer husk so that a nut must be first washed in the river afore it were eaten. so they tried to teach the monkey to wash the coconut, and sure enough, at the end of the first day, one little monkey had learned to wash the coconut. at the end of the second day, another two monkey had learned to wash the coconut. and so it continued that each day more and more monkey learned to wash the coconut. but something happened they did not expect. one day, after the hundredth monkey had learned to wash the coconut, they came to the river and saw lined upon the bank many thousand monkey washing coconut. and they were sore confused and said, how had this come to pass?”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>When determining responsibility for harmful actions, people often consider whether the actor behaved intentionally. The spread of surveillance cameras, “on-officer” recording devices, and smart-phone video makes it increasingly likely that such judgments are aided by video replay. Yet, little is known about how different qualities of the video, such as replay speed, affect human judgment. We demonstrate that slow motion replay can systematically increase judgments of intent because it gives viewers the false impression that the actor had more time to premeditate before acting. In legal proceedings, these judgments of intent can mean the difference between life and death. Thus, any benefits of video replay should be weighed against its potentially biasing effects.</li>

<h2>Understanding and explaining the nature of time remains a major challenge for science</h2>
<p>P. Hunter, Nature 2012 doi:10.1038/embor.2012.13</p>
<h2><em>What doesn't kill you makes you dumber</em></h2>
<p>The idea that infectious disease during childhood affects the developing brain to impact intelligence has been around for decades. Recent evidence from more rigorous studies, which have controlled carefully for other factors such as nutrition and education, has strengthened the case.</p>
<h2><em>Time, evolution and physical reductionism</em></h2>
<p>Valentí Rull<br />
10.1038/embor.2012.4<br />
The experience of time is familiar to us all, yet it remains one of the greatest scientific mysteries. For centuries, physicists and philosophers have puzzled over the nature of time, or even whether it exists at all.</p>
