<h1>adaptive nature of diversity</h1>
<h2>we make the mistake of believing that only those who are similar to us can be our friends — a simplistic rendering of community and society</h2>
<h2>holistic asian vs analytic western demonstrates adaptive nature of having diversity — people born to one culture can learn from the other, and under some conditions one may be more adaptive than the other, while in other situations the adaptive advantage may be in the other direction.</h2>
<h2>uniqueness is valuable, as is conformity. actually everyone is unique, and conformity is an illusion, an idea for which there is a use. we need a kind of conformity in order to create and maintain a society. bullying is one example of the way the idea called conformity is enforced.</h2>
<ul>
<li>conformity eases the ability of abusive people to manipulate people in ways that suit the ends of the abuser.</li>
</ul>
<h2>complex issues are not necessarily difficult problems. they are difficult when our knowledge and experience is specialised but they are much easier when we have broad knowledge and experience. same reason for survival as for fast development. illusion again that we are specialist, everyone has many talents, whether we realise or not.</h2>
<h2>A generalist is valuable where generalists are valued, but also where they are not valued.</h2>
<h2>Because a generalist has diverse abilities, they are less often held back by the obstacle of missing vital links in information or ability, or may be more able to readily compensate for such missing links, or may be more able to switch to or work on alternative approaches or issues until conditions are more favourable.</h2>
<h2>The process of integrating and understand and acting is part of what life is, and the ability to adapt to and deal with obstacles becomes, as time accumulates, an incredibly powerful force — a super–power that each of us has within ourselves. This is a lesson we should learn from water and how it flows.</h2>
<h2>appropriateness as strength</h2>
<ul>
<li>appropriateness, thus responsibilty, timing and integration is a major strength. even meta–appropriate as in when to focus on appropriate and when to be less concerned by it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>the way things are</em></h2>
<p>ole nydahl<br />
isbn 9781846940422</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;re- means back or again and ligare meaning to bind or unite.&quot; p7</li>
<li>p49 &quot;when unexpressed anger dissolves in mind, all is seen clearly as in a mirror. nothing is added nor is anything taken away. exclusive pride is transformed into the experience of the many-sidedness and basic richness of all things. attachment becomes discriminating wisdom, the ability to understand processes or beings both in their uniqueness and as parts of a whole. jealousy, secretly busying itself with anticipation or sticking to the past, turns out to be the wisdom of experience. finally, the way clouds disappear into rain, confusion itself dissolves into all pervading wisdom.&quot;</li>
<li>hmm very interesting. bring more clarity to own view that everything is useful? how about &quot;confusion&quot; as a gathering state? or any of the others as gathering states, for that matter?</li>
</ul>
<h2>dissolving shows different ways of doing things, time rather than speed</h2>
<h2>organisations are mostly poorly equipped to benefit from diversity — instead the lowest–common–denominator often is taken as a standard of quality, what is less offensive (to current taste or prejudice) rather than what is more useful, responsible, ethical</h2>
<h2>related illusion is that we should blend, agree, be the same as our friends and loves — rather than more usefully challenging and being the complement of them</h2>
<h2>collaborate not dominate</h2>

<p><em>epistemological pluralism</em><br />
turkle and papert 1990<br />
Link: <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html">EpistemologicalPluralism.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li>is a great paper which incidentally illustrates some of my style of learning and thinking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>being average at everything isn't hard, it's understanding why we might want to be average at everything that seems to be challenging.</h2>
<ul>
<li>chain as strong as weakest link</li>
<li>net as strong as weakest knot</li>
<li>crystal as strong as weakest facet</li>
<li>when we know we can reach average level at everything, we can achieve some seemingly extraordinary things.</li>
<li>didn't realize it at the time but I was trying to learn something that wasn't in the official curriculum.</li>
<li>it's not that have no fears, just that none of them can stop me moving.</li>
<li>extremely wide on absorption-dissipation scale</li>
</ul>
<h2>it isn't that we can't do most things if we stick to one viewpoint, its just that some things are made much easier if we can shift to another voewpoint.</h2>
<ul>
<li>eg for chemical hormones sometimes look at chemical, sometimes at higher level in system.</li>
<li>eg flexible and tenacious.</li>
<li>so get advantages of both viewpoints. why not?</li>
<li>people who can't admit they are wrong will lack this advantage.</li>
<li>also why past certain point is disadvantage to repeat action, even if very simple and quick — even zen master has learned all that can from doing things that one way and will benefit from experience from another way.</li>
<li>my brain is able to recognise and use things that are useful. I just try not to get in its way!</li>
<li>is why gunbuster is good, why rayearth is good, why inception is good — they show tenacity as well as adaptability to new viewpoints. the tenacity is the obvious part but the adaptability is perhaps less obvious.</li>
<li>if so, why do some people try to tell you there is only one viewpoint? because there are some people who gain power by doing so. this is almost always abusive. they know they can manipulate you more easily if you believe what they say is the one and only truth. they can take your power and use it for their selfish purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>knowing a wider range of things give more metaphors for explaining, more paradigms to place in.</h2>
<h2>there is a mental shorthand that confuses what exists with what is good. unfortunately people also mistakenly use the theory of evolution in this way, they believe that because something exists it must be the most well adapted, the most evolved. in reality, most things are not as well adapted, that is, not as ideal, as we conceive them to be.</h2>
<ul>
<li>just because something is not happenning or appears not to be happening at a certain moment in time, does not mean it is “harder” or cannot or does not happen.</li>
<li>for example, it could be just as “easy” as what is happenning now, but we don't realise it is, or because actually what's happenning now is not really so easy and there are people who want to keep it that way, which makes it harder for everyone to change to a more responsible way of doing things.</li>
</ul>
