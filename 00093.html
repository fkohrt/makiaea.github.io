<p><em>the lung is a site of platelet biogenesis and a reservoir for haematopoietic progenitors</em><br />

<li>Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref1">10</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref2">11</a>, but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref3">12</a>. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also contribute to platelet biogenesis<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref4">13</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref5">14</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref6">15</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref7">16</a>. Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref8">17</a>, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref9">18</a>, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential.</li>

<p><em>a systematic review of ecological attributes that confer resilience to climate change in environmental restoration</em><br />
britta l. timpane-padgham, tim beechie, terrie klinger 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173812">dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173812</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual- (9), population- (6), community- (7), ecosystem- (7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species- or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.</li>

<h1>adaptive nature of diversity</h1>
<h2>the “aim” of evolution is not “survival”, it is “diversity” — which can enable survival, but also many other things.</h2>
<h2>we make the mistake of believing that only those who are similar to us can be our friends — a simplistic rendering of community and society</h2>
<h2>holistic asian vs analytic western demonstrates adaptive nature of having diversity — people born to one culture can learn from the other, and under some conditions one may be more adaptive than the other, while in other situations the adaptive advantage may be in the other direction.</h2>
<h2>uniqueness is valuable, as is conformity. actually everyone is unique, and conformity is an illusion, an idea for which there is a use. we need a kind of conformity in order to create and maintain a society. bullying is one example of the way the idea called conformity is enforced.</h2>
<ul>
<li>conformity eases the ability of abusive people to manipulate people in ways that suit the ends of the abuser.</li>
</ul>
<h2>complex issues are not necessarily difficult problems. they are difficult when our knowledge and experience is specialised but they are much easier when we have broad knowledge and experience. same reason for survival as for fast development. illusion again that we are specialist, everyone has many talents, whether we realise or not.</h2>
<h2>A generalist is valuable where generalists are valued, but also where they are not valued.</h2>
<h2>Because a generalist has diverse abilities, they are less often held back by the obstacle of missing vital links in information or ability, or may be more able to readily compensate for such missing links, or may be more able to switch to or work on alternative approaches or issues until conditions are more favourable.</h2>
<h2>The process of integrating and understand and acting is part of what life is, and the ability to adapt to and deal with obstacles becomes, as time accumulates, an incredibly powerful force — a super–power that each of us has within ourselves. This is a lesson we should learn from water and how it flows.</h2>
<h2>appropriateness as strength</h2>
<ul>
<li>appropriateness, thus responsibilty, timing and integration is a major strength. even meta–appropriate as in when to focus on appropriate and when to be less concerned by it.</li>
</ul>

<li>&quot;re- means back or again and ligare meaning to bind or unite.&quot; p7</li>
<li>p49 &quot;when unexpressed anger dissolves in mind, all is seen clearly as in a mirror. nothing is added nor is anything taken away. exclusive pride is transformed into the experience of the many-sidedness and basic richness of all things. attachment becomes discriminating wisdom, the ability to understand processes or beings both in their uniqueness and as parts of a whole. jealousy, secretly busying itself with anticipation or sticking to the past, turns out to be the wisdom of experience. finally, the way clouds disappear into rain, confusion itself dissolves into all pervading wisdom.&quot;</li>
<li>hmm very interesting. bring more clarity to own view that everything is useful? how about &quot;confusion&quot; as a gathering state? or any of the others as gathering states, for that matter?</li>
</ul>
<h2>dissolving shows different ways of doing things, time rather than speed</h2>
<h2>organisations are mostly poorly equipped to benefit from diversity — instead the lowest–common–denominator often is taken as a standard of quality, what is less offensive (to current taste or prejudice) rather than what is more useful, responsible, ethical</h2>

<li>people who can't admit they are wrong will lack this advantage.</li>
<li>also why past certain point is disadvantage to repeat action, even if very simple and quick — even zen master has learned all that can from doing things that one way and will benefit from experience from another way.</li>
<li>my brain is able to recognise and use things that are useful. I just try not to get in its way!</li>
<li>is why gunbuster is good, why rayearth is good, why inception is good — they show tenacity as well as adaptability to new viewpoints. the tenacity is the obvious part but the adaptability is perhaps less obvious.</li>
<li>if so, why do some people try to tell you there is only one viewpoint? because there are some people who gain power by doing so. this is almost always abusive. they know they can manipulate you more easily if you believe what they say is the one and only truth. they can take your power and use it for their selfish purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>knowing a wider range of things give more metaphors for explaining, more paradigms to place in.</h2>
<h2>there is a mental shorthand that confuses what exists with what is good. unfortunately people also mistakenly use the theory of evolution in this way, they believe that because something exists it must be the most well adapted, the most evolved. in reality, most things are not as well adapted, that is, not as ideal, as we conceive them to be.</h2>
<ul>
<li>just because something is not happenning or appears not to be happening at a certain moment in time, does not mean it is “harder” or cannot or does not happen.</li>
<li>for example, it could be just as “easy” as what is happenning now, but we don't realise it is, or because actually what's happenning now is not really so easy and there are people who want to keep it that way, which makes it harder for everyone to change to a more responsible way of doing things.</li>

<h2><em>disease spread in age structured populations with maternal age effects</em></h2>

<ul>
<li>Fundamental ecological processes, such as extrinsic mortality, determine population age structure. This influences disease spread when individuals of different ages differ in susceptibility or when maternal age determines offspring susceptibility. We show that <em>Daphnia magna</em> offspring born to young mothers are more susceptible than those born to older mothers, and consider this alongside previous observations that susceptibility declines with age in this system. We used a susceptible-infected compartmental model to investigate how age-specific susceptibility and maternal age effects on offspring susceptibility interact with demographic factors affecting disease spread. Our results show a scenario where an increase in extrinsic mortality drives an increase in transmission potential. Thus, we identify a realistic context in which age effects and maternal effects produce conditions favouring disease transmission.</li>

<h2><em>flowering phenology shifts in response to biodiversity loss</em></h2>
<p>amelia a. wolf, erika s. zavaleta, paul c. selmants 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608357114">dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608357114</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advanced spring flowering has been described as a fingerprint of climate change—a public, visible display of the detrimental effects of global warming. However, warming experiments fail to account for the full magnitude of observed changes in phenology, suggesting that other factors may play important roles. We show that peak flowering time shifts earlier for most species when we experimentally reduce plant diversity. Additionally, peak flowering times of plant species are more evenly distributed across the season in high-diversity plots. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of biotic interactions in influencing flowering times and indicate that advancing phenology, one of the most well-described and well-publicized phenomena linking global warming to plant communities, may result equally from biodiversity declines.</p>
<p>Observational studies and experimental evidence agree that rising global temperatures have altered plant phenology—the timing of life events, such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity, with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures.</p>
