<p><em>politics and economic stratification: power resources and income inequality in the united states</em><br />
david jacobs, jonathan c. dirlam 2016<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/687744">687744</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What factors best explain the U.S. growth in economic stratification since the late 1970s? This research tests the power resource hypothesis with a pooled time-series analysis of income inequality. In a departure from prior research, the explanatory power of both national- and state-level political accounts is evaluated. By analyzing tax statistics, the authors isolate the factors that produce the largest gap in U.S. income distributions. Findings indicate that increases in the political strength of neoliberal national administrations and skill-biased technical change (SBTC) are the most influential determinants—although the SBTC account became much less influential after the 1980s. Other accounts have considerable explanatory power, as the results show that inequality grew after decreases in manufacturing and expansions in minority populations. But these findings show that national-level neoliberal political determinants best explain the extraordinary increase in U.S. income inequality.</li>

<p><em>stigma by prejudice transfer</em><br />

<ul>
<li>In the current research, we posited the <em>stigma-by-prejudice-transfer</em> effect, which proposes that stigmatized group members (e.g., White women) are threatened by prejudice that is directed at other stigmatized group members (e.g., African Americans) because they believe that prejudice has monolithic qualities. While most stigma researchers assume that there is a direct correspondence between the attitude of prejudiced individuals and the targets (i.e., sexism affects women, racism affects racial minorities), the five studies reported here demonstrate that White women can be threatened by racism (Study 1, 3, 4, and 5) and men of color by sexism (Study 2). Robust to perceptions of liking and the order in which measures were administered, results showed that prejudice transfers between racism and sexism were driven by the presumed social dominance orientation of the prejudiced individual. In addition, important downstream consequences, such as the increased likelihood of anticipated stigma, expectations of unfair treatment, and the attribution of negative feedback to sexism, appeared for stigmatized individuals.</li>

<p><em>cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis</em><br />
steven marwaha et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>Cannabis use in young people is common and associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the prospective link between cannabis use and bipolar disorder symptoms has rarely been investigated. The study hypothesis was that adolescent cannabis use is associated with hypomania in early adulthood via several potential etiological pathways.<br />
Methods<br />
Data were used from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK birth cohort study. The prospective link between cannabis use at age 17 and hypomania at age 22–23 years was tested using regression analysis, adjusted for gender, early environmental risk factors, alcohol and drug use, and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 18 years. Path analysis examined direct and indirect effects of the link and whether gender, childhood family adversity, or childhood abuse are associated with hypomania via an increased risk of cannabis use.<br />
Results<br />
Data were available on 3370 participants. Cannabis use at least 2–3 times weekly was associated with later hypomania (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.49–3.28) after adjustment. There was a dose–response relationship (any use vs weekly). Cannabis use mediated the association of both childhood sexual abuse and hypomania, and male gender and hypomania. The cannabis use-hypomania link was not mediated by depression or psychotic symptoms.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Adolescent cannabis use may be an independent risk factor for future hypomania, and the nature of the association suggests a potential causal link. Cannabis use mediates the link between childhood abuse and future hypomania. As such it might be a useful target for indicated prevention of hypomania.</li>

<p>there lived a certain man in russia long ago<br />
he was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow<br />
most people looked at him with terror and with fear<br />
but to moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear<br />
he could preach the bible like a preacher<br />
full of ecstasy and fire<br />
but he also was the kind of teacher<br />
women would desire</p>
<p>ra ra rasputin<br />
lover of the russian queen<br />
there was a cat that really was gone<br />
ra ra rasputin<br />
russia's greatest love machine<br />
it was a shame how he carried on</p>
<p>he ruled the russian land and never mind the czar<br />
but the <em>kazachok</em> he danced really <em>wunderbar</em><br />
in all affairs of state he was the man to please<br />
but he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze<br />
for the queen he was no wheeler dealer<br />
though she'd heard the things he'd done<br />
she believed he was a holy healer<br />
who would heal her son</p>
<p>ra ra rasputin<br />
lover of the russian queen<br />
there was a cat that really was gone<br />
ra ra rasputin<br />
russia's greatest love machine<br />
it was a shame how he carried on</p>
<p>but when his drinking and lusting and his hunger<br />
for power became known to more and more people<br />
the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder</p>
<p>this man's just got to go, declared his enemies<br />
but the ladies begged, don't you try to do it, please<br />
no doubt this rasputin had lots of hidden charms<br />
though he was a brute they just fell into his arms<br />
then one night some men of higher standing<br />
set a trap, they're not to blame<br />
come to visit us they kept demanding<br />
and he really came</p>
<p>ra ra rasputin<br />
lover of the russian queen<br />
they put some poison into his wine<br />
ra ra rasputin<br />
russia's greatest love machine<br />
he drank it all and said, i feel fine</p>
<p>ra ra rasputin<br />
lover of the russian queen<br />
they didn't quit, they wanted his head<br />
ra ra rasputin<br />
russia's greatest love machine<br />
and so they shot him 'til he was dead</p>
<p>oh, those russians</p>

<li>for home–makers and paid–workers who share a home; if the accepted genders of the home–maker and the paid–worker are reversed, we begin to see that the differences in behaviour are between those who are, due to their circumstances, in certain roles rather than inherent in the people who happen to occupy those roles. so it is not the gender of the paid–worker that determines their inability to understand the contributions of the home–maker, but the limits that come from the role that they play, or are forced to play.</li>
