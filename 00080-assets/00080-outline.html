But I live in this time, supported at first unknowingly by the lifeblood of countless others.</li><li>Yet although these facts set the scene, they are not the story we wish to tell. Our story begins in that age but ends in another. It is the story of a young man and a young woman who lived far apart across the seas and yet became dearest of friends. It is the story of how they and humankind came to realise that they had all already begun to change irrevocably and that this was why the age was ending and a new one beginning.</li><li>In the year some called 1976, a year of the dragon, were born a boy and a girl. One drew breath for the first time in a city they called London, on an island at the east of the ocean that grows wider. On that little island the signs were ominous. The greatest drought in living memory greeted the dragon year.</li><li>The other first gave voice on another island, many years journey away on an island on the west of the ring of fire. </li><li>(interlude)</li><li>People did not understand that predicting the future was not like some crystal ball that showed you what was going to happen at a specific instant. It is actually knowing the flows of potential and how they will move, not because you know exactly how they will move but because you know how they moved before. It&apos;s like knowing where a ball will land when you have just thrown it. </li><li>That&apos;s what he knew about the reactors. When the information the politicians spouted was almost fact-free, he could still draw the conclusions based on what he knew they could not say. The reactors would not only melt down and explode, it would be many times worse than that first explosion across the world, because here the earthquake had disrupted the non-resilient systems that humans had made. And yet he still wanted to go out there to help, because he knew also what the politicians could not say, the exclusion zones around the reactors were also death sentences to the trapped people who had survived the earthquakes but would now be left to die in the freezing winter. </li><li>Soon also the effects would show more obviously on the rest of the world. The consequences of the explosions not only disrupted the fragile fossil fuel infrastructures on the island, but also worldwide as people came to realise they were really in the same boat — any disruption to the non–resilient structures on which they depended spelled their end. </li><li>So it was time to speak of the skills he had learned, that others were still yet to learn — which he hoped they would soon learn. </li><li>Like the resilient bicycle to search for survivors. Solid rubber tyres where a non-resilient used air–filled — that could not be punctured by debris. Suspension in the frame for both wheels since the solid rubber could not absorb impacts as air –filled tyres could. Powered by muscles, replenished by food. Noisemaker with earmuffs so rider could make noise while muffed and then remove to better hear response from survivors. </li><li>Hell, he even spoke some of the language. </li><li>END</li><li>And though he was yet young, he knew there were not many years ahead for him and he resolved to see his sister one last time. After a journey of many adventures he came to the sea where she grew up and found she had passed on years before. After a period of deep sadness, he lived with joy the remainder of his years among her people, and at the end of his days they scattered his ashes to join her together always on the ocean of the dawn. </li></ul><li>support</li><ul><li>Not everyone is lucky enough to have a guide for the journey.</li><li>When we are too soft, we need someone to support us.</li><li>I wish I had had that support.</li><li>So now I write for myself.</li><li>What would I have liked to have known?

Each year, on a few such pellucid evenings, we might, if we are lucky, see bright arcs streak across the sky as the perseid meteors fall to earth -- or some of them, at least.

(friend is &apos;faxed&apos; a pile of these, they are in the hopper of the fax and he pays for stuff at a merchant with some; there is a sequence with him saying &apos;so why am i in jail when i did nothing wrong&apos; (you see him being rude in many situations, &apos;well-deserving&apos; of jailtime in this culture, such as helping himself to the cash register instead of waiting for the merchant to do it, because the merchant is busy with another customer -- it seems this sequence could encode some of the rules of the bazaar into an example that visitors will understand because it happens to their friend who does not understand why he is being punished). i do wonder why the bazaar is a one-level infinity instead of many but this may just be the metaphor i understand as we shop while walking in our culture from shop to shop, and this configuration enables that behaviour, a behavioural matching to each client? how do we navigate an infinite bazaar? seems like the entire left side is an exit, that ahead and far to the right are an infinite expanse of merchant stores, limit is our eye definition. we move to where we see things we like, towards right and merchants &apos;disappear&apos; to our rear if they &apos;pass&apos; the &apos;left line&apos; which stays relative to us, not to them. this could be a useful navigation method for a filesystem in a computer, for example. the floor curves somewhat upwards so that we get a view over the tops of the stalls a little. each block stall could represent a &apos;folder&apos; or &apos;system&apos; and the individual items on shelves. this is a very compact way to represent way to access storage, in a very limited-scope visual-field display. we &apos;turn to the side&apos; to look at the merchant&apos;s stall, and turn away back to navigation in the bazaar when we are finished. the bazaar is not heirarchical in the bazaar level as all shops are an individual project equal with other projects (is this the way i access information? i remember the name of a project rather than its relation to others) but within each stall there are items on various levels of shelves with those at eye level the most important. then within each item/book there is a sequence that is optional, like the arrangement of a dress or the leaves of a tome. so navigation level is non-heirarchical and simple to navigate, then stall level is semi-heirarchical with eye level used as filter, but many items on same level of shelf, then item level is semi-sequential, we can choose to follow the sequence or not, like pages in a book rather than a single scrolling document. the so-called research into different section of attention being activated for each &apos;room&apos; with memories per-room rather than sequential, might actually be more a per-stall memory rather than per room. the metaphor of going through the doorway and forgetting what we went to the room to get, should rather be a metaphor of resetting expectations when we move to a new stall.</li><li>**extra carpet** in an earlier sequence, was laying down extra carpet to help make a step under which the automatic carpet machine would raise it automatically into a ziggurat-type stair.

can be categorized into three types:[9]<br/><br/>lustful appetite (gluttony, fornication, and avarice)<br/>irascibility (wrath)<br/>intellect (vainglory, sorrow, pride, and Discouragement)<br/>In AD 590, a little over two centuries after Evagrius wrote his list, Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common Seven Deadly Sins, by folding (sorrow/despair/despondency) into acedia, vainglory into pride, and adding envy.[10] In the order used by Pope Gregory, and repeated by Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) centuries later in his epic poem The Divine Comedy, the seven deadly sins are as follows:<br/><br/>luxuria (lechery/lust)[11][12][13]<br/>gula (gluttony)<br/>avaritia (avarice/greed)<br/>acedia (sloth/discouragement)<br/>ira (wrath)<br/>invidia (envy)<br/>superbia (pride)<br/>The identification and definition of the seven deadly sins over their history has been a fluid process and the idea of what each of the seven actually encompasses has evolved over time. Additionally, as a result of semantic change:<br/><br/>socordia sloth was substituted for acedia<br/>It is this revised list that Dante uses. The process of semantic change has been aided by the fact that the personality traits are not collectively referred to, in either a cohesive or codified manner, by the Bible itself; other literary and ecclesiastical works were instead consulted, as sources from which definitions might be drawn.[citation needed] Part II of Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy, Purgatorio, has almost certainly been the best known source since the Renaissance.[citation needed]<br/><br/>The modern Catholic Catechism lists the sins in Latin as &quot;superbia, avaritia, invidia, ira, luxuria, gula, pigritia seu acedia&quot;, with an English translation of &quot;pride, avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth/acedia&quot;.[14] Each of the seven deadly sins now also has an opposite among corresponding seven holy virtues (sometimes also referred to as the contrary virtues). In parallel order to the sins they oppose, the seven holy virtues are humility, charity, kindness, patience, chastity, temperance, and diligence (see below).</li></ul><li>levels of
