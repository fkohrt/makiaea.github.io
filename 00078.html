<p><em>mandrills use olfaction to socially avoid parasitized conspecifics</em><br />

<li>The evolutionary transition from a solitary to a social lifestyle entails an elevated parasite cost because the social proximity associated with group living favors parasite transmission. Despite this cost, sociality is widespread in a large range of taxonomic groups. In this context, hosts would be expected to have evolved behavioral mechanisms to reduce the risk of parasite infection. Few empirical studies have focused on the influence of pathogen-mediated selection on the evolution of antiparasitic behavior in wild vertebrates. We report an adaptive functional relationship between parasitism and social behavior in mandrills, associated with evidence that they are able to gauge parasite status of their group members. Using long-term observations, controlled experiments, and chemical analyses, we show that (i) wild mandrills avoid grooming conspecifics infected with orofecally transmitted parasites; (ii) mandrills receive significantly more grooming after treatment that targets these parasites; (iii) parasitism influences the host’s fecal odors; and (iv) mandrills selectively avoid fecal material from parasitized conspecifics. These behavioral adaptations reveal that selecting safe social partners may help primates to cope with parasite-mediated costs of sociality and that “behavioral immunity” plays a crucial role in the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their parasites.</li>

<li>In developing countries, obesity traditionally affectsmore affluent children, butis spreading to a wider social group. Understanding the perceivedcontributors can provide valuable insights to plan preventive interventions. We exploreddifferences in the perceived causes of childhood obesity between local and migrant communities in a major Chinese city. We conducted 20 focus groups (137 parents, grandparents, school teachers) and 11semi-structured interviews with school Principals from migrant and local communities in Guangzhou. Data were transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach. We found that Lack of influence from grandparents, who were perceived to promote obesogenic behaviorin local children, fewer opportunities for unhealthy snacking and less pressure for academic attainment leading to moreactive play were interpreted as potential “protective” factors among migrant children. Nevertheless, two perceived causes of obesity were more pronounced in migrant than local children: lack of parental monitoring after-school andunsafe neighborhoods limiting physical-activity. Two barriers that restricted child physical activity were only found in the migrant community: limited home space, and cultural differences, inhabitinginteractive play with local children. Future interventions should consider uniquedeterminants of obesity in children from different social backgrounds, with tailored strategies to prevent further rise of the epidemic.</li>

<li>It is well-established that vitamin D, a fat-soluble pro- hormone, is essential in maintaining calcium homeo- stasis and bone health (1). Beyond its skeletal effects, vi- tamin D has a broad role in human health (2). Vitamin D receptors have since been found in many organs and tis- sues, including those of the cardiovascular, digestive, im- mune, and reproductive systems (1). Inadequate vitamin D has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, autoim- mune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and adverse reproduc- tive outcomes (3, 4).<br />
Numerous factors influence vitamin D status in hu- mans, including those related to sun exposure (eg, sun- screen use, latitude, season, etc) as well as race, age, obesity, and several chronic diseases (5). Recent epidemi- ological research suggests that environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may also play a role by altering levels of the circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Data from available hu- man health studies have shown inverse associations be- tween levels of 25(OH)D, the biomarker of vitamin D status in humans, and exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides (6) and polychlorinated biphenyls (7). Studies assessing the extent to which other widely used industrial chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), influence levels of 25(OH)D are scarce.<br />
Phthalates and BPA are high-production chemicals found in numerous industrial and consumer products and have been detected extensively in the U.S. general popu- lation (8–10). Both agents are known endocrine disrup- tors, and they have been shown to alter sex steroid and thyroid hormone levels at multiple points along these hor- monal axes, including at the nuclear receptors (11–14). Because the molecular structure of the active vitamin D metabolite (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]) is similar to that of classic steroid hormones (1) and its nu- clear receptor is within the same superfamily of proteins as steroid and thyroid hormone receptors (15), it is plausible that these environmental chemicals may also exert a broad range of actions on the vitamin D endocrine system (16). For example, whereas the specific biological mechanisms remain unknown, phthalates and BPA may influence 25(OH)D levels by acting directly on the vitamin D nu- clear receptor or on the metabolic activity of enzymes in- volved in converting vitamin D to its active metabolite. Similar pathways have been suggested for the actions of these chemicals on other hormonal systems involved in the regulation of steroid and thyroid hormones (16–18). In the only study assessing these associations to date, an in- verse correlation was observed between serum BPA and 25(OH)D in participants of a study designed to assess certain risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<br />
(19). However, this investigation was limited by sample size, exposure assessment methods, and lack of statistical consideration for confounding variables in the association of interest. Similar studies on phthalates have not been conducted.<br />
Currently, there are no published data on the relation- ships between phthalate and BPA exposure and circulat- ing total 25(OH)D in the U.S. general population. Herein, we investigated these associations in a representative sam- ple of U.S. adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010.</li>

<ul>
<li>Background: Adolescents are a population group at high risk of low vitamin D status, yet the evidence base for establishing dietary vitamin D requirements remains weak.<br />
Objective: The aim was to establish the distribution of vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above proposed cutoffs (25, 30, 40, and 50 nmol/L) during winter in white males and females (14–18 y of age) in the United Kingdom (51°N).<br />
Design: In a dose-response trial, 110 adolescents (aged 15.9 ± 1.4 y; 43% males) were randomly assigned to receive 0, 10, or 20 μg vitamin D3 supplements/d for 20 wk during winter. A nonlinear regression model was fit to total vitamin D intake and postintervention serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and regression-predicted values estimated the vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above specific cutoffs.<br />
Results: Mean ± SD serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from 49.2 ± 12.0 to 56.6 ± 12.4 nmol/L and from 51.7 ± 13.4 to 63.9 ± 10.6 nmol/L in the 10- and 20-μg/d groups, respectively, and decreased in the placebo group from 46.8 ± 11.4 to 30.7 ± 8.6 nmol/L (all P ≤ 0.001). Vitamin D intakes required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25 and &gt;30 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents were estimated to be 10.1 and 13.1 μg/d, respectively, and 6.6 μg/d to maintain 50% of adolescents at concentrations &gt;40 nmol/L. Because the response of 25(OH)D reached a plateau at 46 nmol/L, there is uncertainty in estimating the vitamin D intake required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;50 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents, but it exceeded 30 μg/d.<br />
Conclusion: Vitamin D intakes between 10 and ∼30 μg/d are required by white adolescents during winter to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25–50 nmol/L, depending on the serum 25(OH)D threshold chosen. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02150122 and as International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN40736890.</li>

<ul>
<li>Biologically formed nanoparticles of the strongly magnetic mineral, magnetite, were first detected in the human brain over 20 y ago [Kirschvink JL, Kobayashi-Kirschvink A, Woodford BJ (1992) <em>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</em> 89(16):7683–7687]. Magnetite can have potentially large impacts on the brain due to its unique combination of redox activity, surface charge, and strongly magnetic behavior. We used magnetic analyses and electron microscopy to identify the abundant presence in the brain of magnetite nanoparticles that are consistent with high-temperature formation, suggesting, therefore, an external, not internal, source. Comprising a separate nanoparticle population from the euhedral particles ascribed to endogenous sources, these brain magnetites are often found with other transition metal nanoparticles, and they display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, reflecting crystallization upon cooling from an initially heated, iron-bearing source material. Such high-temperature magnetite nanospheres are ubiquitous and abundant in airborne particulate matter pollution. They arise as combustion-derived, iron-rich particles, often associated with other transition metal particles, which condense and/or oxidize upon airborne release. Those magnetite pollutant particles which are &lt;∼200 nm in diameter can enter the brain directly via the olfactory bulb. Their presence proves that externally sourced iron-bearing nanoparticles, rather than their soluble compounds, can be transported directly into the brain, where they may pose hazard to human health.</li>

<ul>
<li>Running with a forefoot strike (FFS) pattern has been suggested to reduce the risk of overuse running injuries, due to a reduced vertical load rate compared with rearfoot strike (RFS) running. However, resultant load rate has been reported to be similar between foot strikes when running in traditional shoes, leading to questions regarding the value of running with a FFS. The influence of minimal footwear on the resultant load rate has not been considered. This study aimed to compare component and resultant instantaneous loading rate (ILR) between runners with different foot strike patterns in their habitual footwear conditions. Methods: Twenty-nine injury-free participants (22 men, seven women) ran at 3.13 mIs j1 along a 30-m runway, with their habitual foot strike and footwear condition. Ground reaction force data were collected. Peak ILR values were compared between three conditions; those who habitually run with an RFS in standard shoes, with an FFS in standard shoes, and with an FFS in minimal shoes. Results: Peak resultant, vertical, lateral, and medial ILR were lower (P G 0.001) when running in minimal shoes with an FFS than in standard shoes with either foot strike. When running with an FFS, peak posterior ILR were lower (P G 0.001) in minimal than standard shoes. Conclusions: When running in a standard shoe, peak resultant and component ILR were similar between footstrike patterns. However, load rates were lower when running in minimal shoes with a FFS, compared with running in standard shoes with either foot strike. Therefore, it appears that footwear alters the load rates during running, even with similar foot strike patterns.</li>

<ul>
<li>Glucose and glucose metabolites are able to adversely modify proteins through a non-enzymatic reaction called glycation, which is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and is a characteristic of the hyperglycaemia induced by diabetes. However, the precise protein glycation profile that characterises AD is poorly defined and the molecular link between hyperglycaemia and AD is unknown. In this study, we define an early glycation profile of human brain using fluorescent phenylboronate gel electrophoresis and identify early glycation and oxidation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in AD brain. This modification inhibits MIF enzyme activity and ability to stimulate glial cells. MIF is involved in immune response and insulin regulation, hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress and glycation are all implicated in AD. Our study indicates that glucose modified and oxidised MIF could be a molecular link between hyperglycaemia and the dysregulation of the innate immune system in AD.</li>

<pre><code>    •High-intensity interval training improved age-related decline in muscle mitochondria  
      •Training adaptations occurred with increased gene transcripts and ribosome proteins  
      •Changes to RNA with training had little overlap with corresponding protein abundance  
      •Enhanced ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis explain gains in mitochondria  
</code></pre>
<p>Summary<br />
The molecular transducers of benefits from different exercise modalities remain incompletely defined. Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein abundance was noted. HIIT reversed many age-related differences in the proteome, particularly of mitochondrial proteins in concert with increased mitochondrial protein synthesis. Both RT and HIIT enhanced proteins involved in translational machinery irrespective of age. Only small changes of methylation of DNA promoter regions were observed. We provide evidence for predominant exercise regulation at the translational level, enhancing translational capacity and proteome abundance to explain phenotypic gains in muscle mitochondrial function and hypertrophy in all ages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Author Summary<br />
<strong>Why Was This Study Done?</strong><br />
Orthostatic hypotension is a common cause of transient cerebral hypoperfusion that is associated with subclinical brain disease, as well as increased risk of stroke.<br />
Hypoperfusion has been implicated in the pathophysiology of dementia, but whether orthostatic hypotension affects the risk of dementia is uncertain.<br />
<strong>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</strong><br />
Back in 1990, we measured orthostatic hypotension in 6,204 community-dwelling individuals participating in the Dutch population-based Rotterdam Study, and we followed these people for occurrence of dementia until 2014.<br />
Having orthostatic hypotension at start of the study increased the risk of developing dementia over the next 25 years by 15%, with similar results for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease.<br />
The risk of dementia was particularly increased when the orthostatic blood pressure drops were not compensated for by a sufficient increase in heart rate.<br />
<strong>What Do These Findings Mean?</strong><br />
These findings suggest that transient cerebral hypoperfusion plays a role in the aetiology of dementia and that further studies are warranted to investigate the effects of hypoperfusion and treatment of orthostatic hypotension on markers of neurodegenerative disease and cognition.</li>

<li>Nocturia is the symptom that most affects QOL. However, in this clinical study in which the subjects had nocturia and high salt intake, both nighttime frequency and NPi decreased significantly in the group that succeeded in decreasing salt intake (the S group). Furthermore, QOL improved. For patients with nocturia and high salt intake, it might be better to advise salt intake reduction and lifestyle guidance. Salt intake reduction might also be beneficial for patients who respond poorly to medications for nocturia and who have high salt intake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Astrocytes are active partners in neural information processing [ 1, 2 ]. However, the roles of astrocytes in regulating behavior remain unclear [ 3, 4 ]. Because astrocytes have persistent circadian clock gene expression and ATP release in vitro [ 5–8 ], we hypothesized that they regulate daily rhythms in neurons and behavior. Here, we demonstrated that daily rhythms in astrocytes within the mammalian master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), determine the period of wheel-running activity. Ablating the essential clock gene <em>Bmal1</em> specifically in SCN astrocytes lengthened the circadian period of clock gene expression in the SCN and in locomotor behavior. Similarly, excision of the short-period CK1ε <em>tau</em> mutation specifically from SCN astrocytes resulted in lengthened rhythms in the SCN and behavior. These results indicate that astrocytes within the SCN communicate to neurons to determine circadian rhythms in physiology and in rest activity.</li>

<li>•Fasting metabolism is protective in bacterial, but not viral, inflammation<br />
•Ketone bodies limit ROS-induced neuronal damage during bacterial inflammation<br />
•Glucose utilization prevents UPR-mediated neuronal damage during viral inflammation<br />
　<br />
Acute infections are associated with a set of stereotypic behavioral responses, including anorexia, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Although these so-called sickness behaviors are the most common and familiar symptoms of infections, their roles in host defense are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of anorexia in models of bacterial and viral infections. We found that anorexia was protective while nutritional supplementation was detrimental in bacterial sepsis. Furthermore, glucose was necessary and sufficient for these effects. In contrast, nutritional supplementation protected against mortality from influenza infection and viral sepsis, whereas blocking glucose utilization was lethal. In both bacterial and viral models, these effects were largely independent of pathogen load and magnitude of inflammation. Instead, we identify opposing metabolic requirements tied to cellular stress adaptations critical for tolerance of differential inflammatory states.</li>

<p>can't promise that you'll never have a sore throat ever again, but I can promise that this will reduce the severity of the symptoms. Sore throats commonly occur when we are ill, and the symptom is a pain in the throat area. The pain comes because the upper airway, just below the epiglottis, has become drier, and the lining of the airway thus becomes more sensitive. Causes of the dryness could include illness slowing mucus production deeper in the lungs, or very dry air in the house or outside. The temporary solution, however, is easy — you can often relieve a painful sore throat in minutes — all you need to do is to swallow. Swallowing, without actually needing to swallow any food or water, is sufficient to encourage local mucus movement and production right where it is needed most. You may want to experiment with swallowing at different intervals or in different patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swallowing eases the symptom of a sore throat by encouraging wetter mucous from lungs to move faster towards the normal exit point of the oesophagus. Thus the dried out area of the trachea or throat which is hurting is covered by mucous and soothed temporarily.<br />
Seems like common sense once you know it but seems slightly esoteric before you understand why it works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a longer–term solution, drink water often enough to replenish your internal supplies so you can produce enough mucus to suit the air or illness. The only downside is that you'll no longer be able to complain about having a sore throat when you are ill, so people won't believe your illness is as bad as theirs!</p>

<p><em>investigating the case of human nose shape and climate adaptation</em><br />

<p>The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use Qst–Fst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection.</p>
<p>Author summary<br />
The study of human adaptation is essential to our understanding of disease etiology. Evolutionary investigations into why certain disease phenotypes such as sickle-cell anemia and lactose intolerance occur at different rates in different populations have led to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors involved. Similarly, research into the geographical distribution of skin pigmentation continues to yield important clues regarding risk of vitamin D deficiency and skin cancer. Here, we investigate whether variation in the shape of the external nose across populations has been driven by regional differences in climate. We find that variation in both nares width and alar base width appear to have experienced accelerated divergence across human populations. We also find that the geospatial distribution of nares width is correlated with temperature, and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. Our results support the claim that local adaptation to climate may have had a role in the evolution of nose shape differences across human populations.</p>

<p>sneezing causing split lips<br />
if you sneeze suddenly when your lips are very dry, such as after a long night in a dry room, you may split your lips. to prevent this, try to wet your lips before you sneeze.</p>

<li>“Intrigued by what I learned in Lipton’s book but curious to know more, I interviewed him. He explained to me that in his bench research as a cell biologist, he worked with pleuripotential stem cells, cells that can become anything when they grow up. He placed one cell in a Petri dish, where it was nourished with cell-culture medium, as it divided into many genetically identical cells. Lipton then split the cells into three Petri dishes and exposed them to three different culture mediums (the environment). What he discovered was that the environment to which the cell was exposed determined whether the cell became a muscle cell or a fat cell or a bone cell. Even though all the cells were genetically identical, they expressed themselves differently. The final outcome of the same genetically identical DNA was expressed as radically different cells. What controlled the fate of the cells? Not the genetics. They were all genetically identical. The sole difference was the environment to which the same DNA was exposed. The cellular environment also determined whether or not the cells stayed healthy. Cells exposed to a “good” environment (a healthy cell medium) enjoyed optimal health, while those exposed to a “bad” environment (an unhealthy cell medium) got sick. Lipton said, “If I were an allopathic physician of cells, I’d diagnose the cells in the bad medium as sick. Surely, they need medicine. But that’s not really what they need. If you take the sick cells out of the bad environment and put them back into the good environment, they naturally recover—without medicine.” One day, as he was observing the cells in his lab, Lipton had an epiphany. He realized that the human body is no different from the cells in his lab. Lipton said, “The human is nothing more than a skin-covered Petri dish with a community of 50 trillion cells. Whether the cells are in our bodies or in the Petri dish doesn’t matter. The culture medium of the cells in our bodies is the blood that bathes and feeds them. If we change the composition of the blood, it’s the same as changing the culture medium of the cells. So what controls the composition of the blood? The brain is the chemist changing the environment to which our cells are exposed. The brain releases neuropeptides, hormones, growth factors, and other chemicals, akin to adding chemicals to a Petri dish with a pipette, thereby changing the cell medium.” When I asked him how belief can change the cellular environment, Lipton explained that the brain is perception, but the mind is interpretation. It’s all about how the mind interprets a life event. For example, you can open your eyes and see a person. (This is your brain’s objective perception.) Your mind may then recognize this person as someone you love. (This is the mind’s interpretation.) The brain then releases oxytocin, dopamine, endorphins, and other positive chemicals that provide the healthy cell medium of the whole body’s cells via the blood. If, on the other hand, you open your eyes and see a person (the perception), and your mind interprets this person as scary, the brain releases stress hormones and other fear chemicals that damage the cells. Lipton says, “When we shift the mind’s interpretation of illness from fear and danger to positive belief, the brain responds biochemically, the blood changes the body’s cell culture, and the cells change on a biological level.”</li>
