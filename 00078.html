<h2>rarely have coughing caused by own nasal mucus anymore, because have learned to swallow it before it reaches the lungs.</h2>
<h2>simple muscle tension experiment: if place flat of palm of hand against conductive bone near ear, or on ear, at night, while head rests gently on palm — pillow useful for placement. if tense either muscles in arm or cheek, can hear the subtle vibrations as muscles act in dynamic tension, lack of vibration when all muscles relaxed.</h2>
<h2>can't promise that you'll never have a sore throat ever again, but I can promise that this will reduce the severity of the symptoms. Sore throats commonly occur when we are ill, and the symptom is a pain in the throat area. The pain comes because the upper airway, just below the epiglottis, has become drier, and the lining of the airway thus becomes more sensitive. Causes of the dryness could include illness slowing mucus production deeper in the lungs, or very dry air in the house or outside. The temporary solution, however, is easy — you can often relieve a painful sore throat in minutes — all you need to do is to swallow. Swallowing, without actually needing to swallow any food or water, is sufficient to encourage local mucus movement and production right where it is needed most. You may want to experiment with swallowing at different intervals or in different patterns.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swallowing eases the symptom of a sore throat by encouraging wetter mucous from lungs to move faster towards the normal exit point of the oesophagus. Thus the dried out area of the trachea or throat which is hurting is covered by mucous and soothed temporarily.<br />
Seems like common sense once you know it but seems slightly esoteric before you understand why it works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a longer–term solution, drink water often enough to replenish your internal supplies so you can produce enough mucus to suit the air or illness. The only downside is that you'll no longer be able to complain about having a sore throat when you are ill, so people won't believe your illness is as bad as theirs!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>prevent dry–air nosebleeds</h2>
<p>wait for new thin film of wet mucous to form between dried mucous and nasal passage before attempting to blow out dried mucous from nose. if this means stifling sneezes for a little while, do so.</p>

<h2>lipton pluripotent shift</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Intrigued by what I learned in Lipton’s book but curious to know more, I interviewed him. He explained to me that in his bench research as a cell biologist, he worked with pleuripotential stem cells, cells that can become anything when they grow up. He placed one cell in a Petri dish, where it was nourished with cell-culture medium, as it divided into many genetically identical cells. Lipton then split the cells into three Petri dishes and exposed them to three different culture mediums (the environment). What he discovered was that the environment to which the cell was exposed determined whether the cell became a muscle cell or a fat cell or a bone cell. Even though all the cells were genetically identical, they expressed themselves differently. The final outcome of the same genetically identical DNA was expressed as radically different cells. What controlled the fate of the cells? Not the genetics. They were all genetically identical. The sole difference was the environment to which the same DNA was exposed. The cellular environment also determined whether or not the cells stayed healthy. Cells exposed to a “good” environment (a healthy cell medium) enjoyed optimal health, while those exposed to a “bad” environment (an unhealthy cell medium) got sick. Lipton said, “If I were an allopathic physician of cells, I’d diagnose the cells in the bad medium as sick. Surely, they need medicine. But that’s not really what they need. If you take the sick cells out of the bad environment and put them back into the good environment, they naturally recover—without medicine.” One day, as he was observing the cells in his lab, Lipton had an epiphany. He realized that the human body is no different from the cells in his lab. Lipton said, “The human is nothing more than a skin-covered Petri dish with a community of 50 trillion cells. Whether the cells are in our bodies or in the Petri dish doesn’t matter. The culture medium of the cells in our bodies is the blood that bathes and feeds them. If we change the composition of the blood, it’s the same as changing the culture medium of the cells. So what controls the composition of the blood? The brain is the chemist changing the environment to which our cells are exposed. The brain releases neuropeptides, hormones, growth factors, and other chemicals, akin to adding chemicals to a Petri dish with a pipette, thereby changing the cell medium.” When I asked him how belief can change the cellular environment, Lipton explained that the brain is perception, but the mind is interpretation. It’s all about how the mind interprets a life event. For example, you can open your eyes and see a person. (This is your brain’s objective perception.) Your mind may then recognize this person as someone you love. (This is the mind’s interpretation.) The brain then releases oxytocin, dopamine, endorphins, and other positive chemicals that provide the healthy cell medium of the whole body’s cells via the blood. If, on the other hand, you open your eyes and see a person (the perception), and your mind interprets this person as scary, the brain releases stress hormones and other fear chemicals that damage the cells. Lipton says, “When we shift the mind’s interpretation of illness from fear and danger to positive belief, the brain responds biochemically, the blood changes the body’s cell culture, and the cells change on a biological level.”</li>

<li>It is well-established that vitamin D, a fat-soluble pro- hormone, is essential in maintaining calcium homeo- stasis and bone health (1). Beyond its skeletal effects, vi- tamin D has a broad role in human health (2). Vitamin D receptors have since been found in many organs and tis- sues, including those of the cardiovascular, digestive, im- mune, and reproductive systems (1). Inadequate vitamin D has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, autoim- mune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and adverse reproduc- tive outcomes (3, 4).<br />
Numerous factors influence vitamin D status in hu- mans, including those related to sun exposure (eg, sun- screen use, latitude, season, etc) as well as race, age, obesity, and several chronic diseases (5). Recent epidemi- ological research suggests that environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may also play a role by altering levels of the circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Data from available hu- man health studies have shown inverse associations be- tween levels of 25(OH)D, the biomarker of vitamin D status in humans, and exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides (6) and polychlorinated biphenyls (7). Studies assessing the extent to which other widely used industrial chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), influence levels of 25(OH)D are scarce.<br />
Phthalates and BPA are high-production chemicals found in numerous industrial and consumer products and have been detected extensively in the U.S. general popu- lation (8–10). Both agents are known endocrine disrup- tors, and they have been shown to alter sex steroid and thyroid hormone levels at multiple points along these hor- monal axes, including at the nuclear receptors (11–14). Because the molecular structure of the active vitamin D metabolite (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]) is similar to that of classic steroid hormones (1) and its nu- clear receptor is within the same superfamily of proteins as steroid and thyroid hormone receptors (15), it is plausible that these environmental chemicals may also exert a broad range of actions on the vitamin D endocrine system (16). For example, whereas the specific biological mechanisms remain unknown, phthalates and BPA may influence 25(OH)D levels by acting directly on the vitamin D nu- clear receptor or on the metabolic activity of enzymes in- volved in converting vitamin D to its active metabolite. Similar pathways have been suggested for the actions of these chemicals on other hormonal systems involved in the regulation of steroid and thyroid hormones (16–18). In the only study assessing these associations to date, an in- verse correlation was observed between serum BPA and 25(OH)D in participants of a study designed to assess certain risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<br />
(19). However, this investigation was limited by sample size, exposure assessment methods, and lack of statistical consideration for confounding variables in the association of interest. Similar studies on phthalates have not been conducted.<br />
Currently, there are no published data on the relation- ships between phthalate and BPA exposure and circulat- ing total 25(OH)D in the U.S. general population. Herein, we investigated these associations in a representative sam- ple of U.S. adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010.</li>

<p><em>estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin d in adolescents aged 14-18 y: a dose-response, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Background: Adolescents are a population group at high risk of low vitamin D status, yet the evidence base for establishing dietary vitamin D requirements remains weak.<br />
Objective: The aim was to establish the distribution of vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above proposed cutoffs (25, 30, 40, and 50 nmol/L) during winter in white males and females (14–18 y of age) in the United Kingdom (51°N).<br />
Design: In a dose-response trial, 110 adolescents (aged 15.9 ± 1.4 y; 43% males) were randomly assigned to receive 0, 10, or 20 μg vitamin D3 supplements/d for 20 wk during winter. A nonlinear regression model was fit to total vitamin D intake and postintervention serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and regression-predicted values estimated the vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above specific cutoffs.<br />
Results: Mean ± SD serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from 49.2 ± 12.0 to 56.6 ± 12.4 nmol/L and from 51.7 ± 13.4 to 63.9 ± 10.6 nmol/L in the 10- and 20-μg/d groups, respectively, and decreased in the placebo group from 46.8 ± 11.4 to 30.7 ± 8.6 nmol/L (all P ≤ 0.001). Vitamin D intakes required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25 and &gt;30 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents were estimated to be 10.1 and 13.1 μg/d, respectively, and 6.6 μg/d to maintain 50% of adolescents at concentrations &gt;40 nmol/L. Because the response of 25(OH)D reached a plateau at 46 nmol/L, there is uncertainty in estimating the vitamin D intake required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;50 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents, but it exceeded 30 μg/d.<br />
Conclusion: Vitamin D intakes between 10 and ∼30 μg/d are required by white adolescents during winter to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;25–50 nmol/L, depending on the serum 25(OH)D threshold chosen. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02150122 and as International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN40736890.</li>
