<p><em>learning about and from others' prudence, impatience or laziness: the computational bases of attitude alignment</em><br />
marie devaine, jean daunizeau 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005422">dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005422</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Peoples' subjective attitude towards costs such as, e.g., risk, delay or effort are key determinants of inter-individual differences in goal-directed behaviour. Thus, the ability to learn about others' prudent, impatient or lazy attitudes is likely to be critical for social interactions. Conversely, how adaptive such attitudes are in a given environment is highly uncertain. Thus, the brain may be tuned to garner information about how such costs ought to be arbitrated. In particular, observing others' attitude may change one's uncertain belief about how to best behave in related difficult decision contexts. In turn, learning <em>from</em> others' attitudes is determined by one's ability to learn <em>about</em> others' attitudes. We first derive, from basic optimality principles, the computational properties of such a learning mechanism. In particular, we predict two apparent cognitive biases that would arise when individuals are learning about others’ attitudes: (i) people should overestimate the degree to which they resemble others (false-consensus bias), and (ii) they should align their own attitudes with others’ (social influence bias). We show how these two biases non-trivially interact with each other. We then validate these predictions experimentally by profiling people's attitudes both before and after guessing a series of cost-benefit arbitrages performed by calibrated artificial agents (which are impersonating human individuals).</p>
<p>What do people learn <em>from</em> observing others' attitudes, such as &quot;prudence&quot;, &quot;impatience&quot; or &quot;laziness&quot;? Rather than viewing these attitudes as examples of highly subjective personality traits, we assume that they derive from uncertain (and mostly implicit) beliefs about how to best weigh risks, delays and efforts in ensuing cost-benefit trade-offs. In this view, it is adaptive to update one's belief after having observed others' attitude, which provides valuable information regarding how to best behave in related difficult decision contexts. This is the starting point of our computational model of attitude alignment, which we derive from first optimality principles as well as from recent neuroscientific findings. Critical here is the impact of one's ability to learn <em>about</em> others' covert mental states or attitudes, which is known as &quot;mentalizing&quot; or &quot;Theory of Mind&quot;. In particular, this model makes two (otherwise unrelated) predictions that conform to known but puzzling cognitive biases of social cognition in humans, namely: &quot;false consensus&quot; and &quot;social influence&quot;. It also shows how attitude alignment may eventually follow from the interaction between these two biases. Using state-of-the-art behavioural and computational methods, we provide experimental evidence that confirm these predictions. Finally, we discuss the relevance and implications of this work, both from a neuroscientific and economic perspective.</p>

<p><em>eye-tracking causality</em><br />

<li>How do people make causal judgments? What role, if any, does counterfactual simulation play? Counterfactual theories of causal judgments predict that people compare what actually happened with what would have happened if the candidate cause had been absent. Process theories predict that people focus only on what actually happened, to assess the mechanism linking candidate cause and outcome. We tracked participants’ eye movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate or prevented it from going through. Both participants’ looking patterns and their judgments demonstrated that counterfactual simulation played a critical role. Participants simulated where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger the causal judgments. These results provide the first direct evidence for spontaneous counterfactual simulation in an important domain of high-level cognition.</li>

<p><em>supernatural belief is not modulated by intuitive thinking style or cognitive inhibition</em><br />
miguel farias et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14090-9">dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14090-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Intuitive Belief Hypothesis, supernatural belief relies heavily on intuitive thinking—and decreases when analytic thinking is engaged. After pointing out various limitations in prior attempts to support this Intuitive Belief Hypothesis, we test it across three new studies using a variety of paradigms, ranging from a pilgrimage field study to a neurostimulation experiment. In all three studies, we found no relationship between intuitive or analytical thinking and supernatural belief. We conclude that it is premature to explain belief in gods as ‘intuitive’, and that other factors, such as socio-cultural upbringing, are likely to play a greater role in the emergence and maintenance of supernatural belief than cognitive style.</li>
<li>Our studies here suggest that it is probably about time psychologists reconsider their understanding of belief as ‘natural’ or ‘intuitive’, and instead focus on cultural and social learning factors that give rise to supernatural ideas. Religious belief may be rooted in our society and culture (a sociocultural ‘meme’), rather than in some primitive gut intuition.</li>

<p><em>the religiosity of academic scientists in the united kingdom: assessing the role of discipline and department status</em><br />
elaine howard ecklund et al. 2018<br />

<p>In a new study, researchers from Rice University, Baruch College and West Virginia University find that scientists are indeed significantly less religious than the general population there.</p>
<p>In addition, U.K. scientists at elite universities are more likely to never attend religious services than those at less prestigious schools. The study also indicates biologists are more likely to never attend religious services than physicists.</p>
<p>&quot;The Religiosity of Academic Scientists in the United Kingdom: Assessing the Role of Discipline and Department Status&quot; utilizes data collected in a survey of biologists and physicists employed at elite and nonelite departments, as past research has suggested the distinction could be relevant in understanding differences in religiosity. The researchers were interested in how U.K. scientists, particularly elite scientists, compared to the general population with regard to religious beliefs.</p>
<p>The researchers found that while only 18 percent of people in the U.K. said they do not believe in God, 45 percent of U.K. scientists responded the same way. In addition, the researchers discovered that scientists in elite departments (a categorization based on the number of publications per department, published department rankings and insider knowledge) are about twice as likely to never attend religious services than scientists in nonelite departments.</p>
<p>Elaine Howard Ecklund, the Herbert S. Autrey Chair in Social Sciences, professor of sociology, director of Rice's Religion and Public Life Program and the study's lead author, observes that that elite scientists represent the leading edge of the secularizing effects of science.</p>
<p>&quot;Individuals who are at the most elite institutions may disproportionately feel the cultural pressure to secularize,&quot; Ecklund said. &quot;So, if those methods and mindset are inherently in conflict with religion, then these successful scientists would experience the greatest erosion of religious faith.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecklund noted that such findings could also be a product of social forces rather than intellectual ones.</p>
<p>&quot;This distinction could have an impact on how the public views scientists, in a national context where some minority groups are bringing challenges to teaching evolutionary theory, for example,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Elite scientists might express less religiosity because they assume that, as elite scientists, they are supposed to be or need to be less religious to fit a professional ideal,&quot; she added. &quot;Because they might already be on the fringes of that professional ideal in the first place, nonelite scientists may feel less social and cultural pressure to further conform to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Study co-author Christopher P. Scheitle of West Virginia University's Department of Sociology and Anthropology said this might also help explain why U.K. biologists are more than 2½ times more likely to never attend religious services than British physicists.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible that U.K. biologists might be concerned that being seen as a more active participant in religion would violate some professional norm,&quot; said Jared Peifer, an assistant professor in the Department of Management at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business.</p>
<p>Ecklund added: &quot;This norm might result from the history of public conflict surrounding issues like evolution and stem cell research, which are most clearly connected to the biological sciences.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers hope their work will help foster a better understanding of the social dynamics between religion and science beyond the traditional focus on the U.S.</p>
<p>The study was funded by a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Studies examining the religiosity of academic scientists have often focused on comparisons with the general population, overlooking dynamics that could lead to religiosity differences within the scientist population. Expanding this literature, we present data from a survey of religiosity among scientists in the United Kingdom. We compare biologists and physicists employed at elite and nonelite departments, as past research has suggested that disciplinary and status divisions could be salient in understanding differences in scientists’ religiosity. We find that biologists in the United Kingdom are more likely than physicists to say they never attend religious services. Similarly, U.K. scientists in elite departments are more likely than those in nonelite departments to say they never attend religious services. We do not find significant differences between disciplines or status types for more private measures of religion. We argue that these patterns could result from perceived conflicts between public religious practice and meeting professional norms</p>

<li>Inference of causality in time series has been principally based on the prediction paradigm. Nonetheless, the predictive causality approach may underestimate the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of causal interactions observed in real-world phenomena. Here, we present a causal-decomposition approach that is not based on prediction, but based on the covariation of cause and effect: cause is that which put, the effect follows; and removed, the effect is removed. Using empirical mode decomposition, we show that causal interaction is encoded in instantaneous phase dependency at a specific time scale, and this phase dependency is diminished when the causal-related intrinsic component is removed from the effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generic applicability of our method to both stochastic and deterministic systems, and show the consistency of causal-decomposition method compared to existing methods, and finally uncover the key mode of causal interactions in both modelled and actual predator–prey systems.</li>

of lovers sleeping tight<br />
are rolling by like thunder now<br />
as i look in your eyes</p>
<p>i hold on to your body<br />
and feel each move you make<br />
your voice is warm and tender<br />
a love that i could not forsake</p>
<p>☆for you’re my lady<br />
　and i am your man<br />
　whenever you reach for me<br />
　i’ll do all that i can</p>
<p>though there may be times<br />
i might seem far away<br />
you need not ask for where i am<br />
as i am always by your side</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>★we’re heading for something<br />
　somewhere we’ve never been<br />
　sometimes we are frightened<br />
　but we’re ready to learn<br />
　about of the power of love</p>
<p>the sound of your heart beating<br />
made it clear so suddenly<br />
the feeling that i can’t go on<br />
is light years away</p>

trying to get up that great big hill of hope<br />
for a destination<br />
i realized quickly when i knew i should<br />
that the world was made up of this<br />
brotherhood of man<br />
for whatever that means</p>
<p>and so i cry sometimes when i’m lying in bed<br />
just to get it all out, what’s in my head<br />
and i, i’m feeling a little peculiar<br />
and so i wake in the morning and i step outside<br />
and i take deep breath<br />
and i get real high<br />
and i scream to the top of my lungs<br />
what’s goin’ on?</p>
<p>☆and i say hey–yeah–yeah–yeah, hey yea yea<br />
　i say hey! what’s goin’ on<br />
　and i say hey–yeah–yea–eah, hey yea yea<br />

i try all the time<br />
in this institution<br />
and i pray, oh my god do i pray<br />
i pray every single day<br />
for revolution</p>
<p>and so i cry sometimes when i’m lying in bed<br />
just to get it all out what’s in my head<br />

if it is a law, the devious and cunning will find a way around it. if internalised then they cannot. what exists in our heads is more powerful than what exists outside. so it is with mo–tzu's argument that ghosts exist. seemingly pointless but it is actually true.<br />
Mo–tzu's appeal to ancestors is an appeal to highest truth. just like an appeal to god or logic or reason or utility or evolution.</li>

<li>i love my friends and family dearly but It’s sad that I know I cannot rely on anyone, which is why I have an imaginary–big–sister complex. but why is wanting someone to rely on so vital to me? perhaps because I felt constantly threatened as a child? but the reality is that most people will have nobody to rely on, and this is what has shaped our society, our lives, and our past. will we let it shape our future too?</li>
<li>is the solution to seek something to rely on, or is it to understand that “being able to rely on something” is an illusion, an illusion among many?</li>

<li>most of us are familiar with the idea of symptoms and root causes. but what if what we think are root causes are actually also symptoms? any luck we have with solving our problems is just that — luck — and we never actually deal with root causes, ever. this does not mean we do not lead productive lives, it just means our lives are not we believe them to be.</li>
