<p><em>want to bring a community together? create more sub-communities</em><br />

<li><em>abstract</em> Understanding overlapping community structures is crucial for network analysis and prediction. AGM (Affiliation Graph Model) is one of the favorite models for explaining the densely overlapped community structures. In this paper, we thoroughly re-investigate the assumptions made by the AGM model on real datasets. We find that the AGM model is not sufficient to explain several empirical behaviors observed in popular real-world networks. To our surprise, all our experimental results can be explained by a parameter-free hypothesis, leading to more straightforward modeling than AGM which has many parameters. Based on these findings, we propose a parameter-free Jaccard-based Affiliation Graph (JAG) model which models the probability of edge as a network specific constant times the Jaccard similarity between community sets associated with the individuals. Our modeling is significantly simpler than AGM, and it eliminates the need of associating a parameter, the probability value, with each community. Furthermore, JAG model naturally explains why (and in fact when) overlapping communities are densely connected. Based on these observations, we propose a new community-driven friendship formation process, which mathematically recovers the JAG model. JAG is the first model that points towards a direct causal relationship between tight connections in the given community with the number of overlapping communities inside it. Thus, <em>the most effective way to bring a community together is to form more sub-communities within it.</em> The community detection algorithm based on our modeling demonstrates a significantly simple algorithm with state-of-the-art accuracy on six real-world network datasets compared to the existing link analysis based methods.</li>

<p><em>concern for others leads to vicarious optimism</em><br />

<li>An optimistic learning bias leads people to update their beliefs in response to better-than-expected good news but neglect worse-than-expected bad news. Because evidence suggests that this bias arises from self-concern, we hypothesized that a similar bias may affect beliefs about other people’s futures, to the extent that people care about others. Here, we demonstrated the phenomenon of <em>vicarious optimism</em> and showed that it arises from concern for others. Participants predicted the likelihood of unpleasant future events that could happen to either themselves or others. In addition to showing an optimistic learning bias for events affecting themselves, people showed vicarious optimism when learning about events affecting friends and strangers. Vicarious optimism for strangers correlated with generosity toward strangers, and experimentally increasing concern for strangers amplified vicarious optimism for them. These findings suggest that concern for others can bias beliefs about their future welfare and that optimism in learning is not restricted to oneself.</li>

<li>Making friends is critical to well-being. We also live in a society where the display of status is ubiquitous and billions of dollars are spent on high-status consumer goods. In the present analysis, we introduce the <em>Status Signals Paradox</em>: When making new friends, people tend to think that displaying high-status markers of themselves (e.g., a BMW, a Tag Heuer watch) will make them more attractive to others than neutral markers (e.g., a Honda, a generic brand watch); however, from the perspective of would-be friends, individuals who display high-status markers are found to be <em>less</em> attractive as new friends than those with neutral status markers. Six studies provide converging evidence of the status signals paradox.</li>

<p><em>social support drives female dominance in the spotted hyaena</em><br />
colin vullioud et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0718-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0718-9</a></p>

<p>Spotted hyaena females are often portrayed as archetypes of powerful and ferocious females. They are on average heavier than the males, have highly masculinised outer genitalia (a ‘pseudo-penis’ and a ‘pseudo-scrotum’), and usually occupy the highest position in the society. But according to the new study, it is not their manliness that allows them to dominate males. “When two hyaenas squabble, the one that can rely on greater social support wins, irrespective of sex, body mass or aggressiveness,” explains Oliver Hoener, head of the Ngorongoro Hyena Project of the Leibniz-IZW. Differences in social support between two individuals correctly predicted who will be the dominant in almost all encounters and in all contexts — between natives and immigrants, members of the same and different clans, residents and intruders, and individuals of the same and opposite sex. Female dominance thus emerges from females being more likely to receive greater social support than males. “What is so fascinating is that it all works without any direct involvement of other hyaenas,” says Colin Vullioud, Hoener’s colleague at Leibniz-IZW and first author of the study. “In the end, it’s all about assertiveness and how confident a hyaena is of receiving support if needed.”<br />
For their study, the scientists analysed the outcome of 4133 agonistic interactions between 748 hyaenas from eight different clans monitored for 21 years in the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. To estimate potential social support, they developed an algorithm that predicted for each clan member, which of two interacting hyaenas it would support; this algorithm was derived from behavioural observations of social support and relatedness estimates based on one of the most comprehensive pedigrees of a free-ranging mammal. “To tease apart the effects of social support and intrinsic attributes such as body mass, one needs to evaluate each effect while controlling for the presence of the other” explains Francois Rousset (ISEM), who has developed statistical methods for such purposes. “When this is done, the effects of sex and body mass appear negligible.”<br />
In many social contexts, female and male hyaenas can rely on equal social support and are equally likely to win. But there is one exception: when natives interact with immigrant clan members. “Hyaena society is highly nepotistic and social support is primarily given to kin. Native clan members live among their relatives and have a competitive advantage over immigrants because immigrants lose their social bonds when they disperse from home” explains Eve Davidian (Leibniz-IZW), co-first author of the study. “In this context, females have the upper hand because immigrants are usually males.” Female dominance in spotted hyaenas is therefore driven by the sex bias in dispersal and the demographic structure of the clan: when the clan contains a high proportion of immigrant males, female dominance is nearly absolute. But when the clan contains many native males, males win almost as often as females and the sexes are co-dominant.<br />
“Identifying the determinants of dominance relationships between the sexes is fundamental to understanding the evolution of reproductive strategies, gender roles, and sexual conflicts,” concludes Alexandre Courtiol (Leibniz-IZW), co-senior author of the study. “Our findings show that social dominance of one sex over the other — a trait that characterises gender roles — does not need to be a direct consequence of sex or physical strength, but can be shaped by the social environment.” By demonstrating the key role of social support in mediating the establishment of dominance — and sex-biased dominance — the study improves our understanding of the social impact of nepotism, political alliances, as well as emigration and immigration patterns in animal and human societies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Identifying how dominance within and between the sexes is established is pivotal to understanding sexual selection and sexual conflict. In many species, members of one sex dominate those of the other in one-on-one interactions. Whether this results from a disparity in intrinsic attributes, such as strength and aggressiveness, or in extrinsic factors, such as social support, is currently unknown. We assessed the effects of both mechanisms on dominance in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), a species where sexual size dimorphism is low and females often dominate males. We found that individuals with greater potential social support dominated one-on-one interactions in all social contexts, irrespective of their body mass and sex. Female dominance emerged from a disparity in social support in favour of females. This disparity was a direct consequence of male-biased dispersal and the disruptive effect of dispersal on social bonds. Accordingly, the degree of female dominance varied with the demographic and kin structure of the social groups, ranging from male and female co-dominance to complete female dominance. Our study shows that social support can drive sex-biased dominance and provides empirical evidence that a sex-role-defining trait can emerge without the direct effect of sex.</p>

<p>Does whom you know in the status hierarchy prevent or trigger health limitation (life disruption due to health problems)? Does that effect vary by society? To addresses these two questions, this study applies five theories and analyzes nationally representative data from three societies (the United States, urban China, and Taiwan). Social capital theory expects accessed status (network members’ status) to prevent health limitation, while social cost theory as proposed here asserts the opposite. The collectivistic advantage explanation anticipates social capital theory to apply more to urban China and Taiwan but social cost theory to apply more to the United States, while the collectivistic disadvantage explanation predicts the opposite. The inequality structure explanation expects social capital theory to apply more to Taiwan and social cost theory to apply more to the United States and urban China. This study measures accessed status on the occupational dimension. Results support social capital theory in Taiwan, social cost theory in the other two societies, and the inequality structure explanation across the three societies.</p>

<p>when you’re down / and troubled / and you need some loving care<br />
and nothing / whoa /nothing is going right<br />
close your eyes / and think of me / and soon i will be there<br />
to brighten up / even your darkest nights</p>
<p>☆you just call out my name / and you know wherever i am<br />
　i’ll come running / to see you again<br />
　winter, spring, summer, or fall / all you have to do is call<br />
　and i’ll be there, yes i will<br />
　you’ve got a friend</p>
<p>if the sky / up above you / should turn dark and full of clouds<br />
and that old / north wind / should begin to blow<br />
keep your head together / and call my name out loud<br />
soon you’ll hear me knocking / on your door</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>hey, ain’t it good to know / that you’ve got a friend?<br />
when people / can be so cold<br />
they’ll hurt you / and desert you<br />
and take your soul if you let them<br />
but don’t you let them</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>

<li>it turns out that it is often your friends who are the problem for righteous people. by supporting you in your righteousness, they encourage your extremism, instead of mitigating it, thus damaging your ability to maintain real relationships. sometimes they will repent, long after the damage is sadly irreversible.</li>

<li>even when communicating with our closest friends, many of us are trained to assume worse than we should — rather, for those of us who are lucky enough not to have been trained this way, relationships are more adaptable and can flourish more easily than for most people.</li>
<li>but in today's society this is rare, and symmetric friendships of this type are even more rare, for that same reason. right now, few people are fortunate enough to be in circumstances where they can to wholeheartedly trust another, but it doesn't have to be that way forever.</li>
