<p>available in ios via external bluetooth keyboard (add Greek as keyboard option in settings, attach bluetooth keyboard, select hardware keyboard option Greek polytonic), but very usable on mac:<br />
<br/></p>
<p>system preferences - keyboard - input sources; add greek - polytonic<br />
<br/></p>
<p>system preferences - keyboard - shortcuts - input sources; select a key combination for changing the input source, e.g. hyper2–`<br />
<br/></p>
<p>type a combination of keys to specify accents for the letter, before you enter the accented letter:<br />
<br/></p>
<p>|<br />
---: | :--- | :---<br />
smooth breather | ᾽ | '<br />
rough breather | ῾ | &quot;<br />
acute | ´ | ;<br />
diaresis | ¨ | :<br />
circumflex | ῀ | [<br />
iota subscript | ι | {<br />
grave | ` | ]<br />
grave (also) | ` | }<br />
circumflex with smooth breather | ῏ | -<br />
circumflex with rough breather | ῟ | _<br />
acute with smooth breather | ῎ | /<br />
acute with rough breather | ῞ | ?<br />
<br/></p>
<p>you can get by with the single combining accents until you are comfortable with them, and then add the other keys as you gain speed. There are several other keys you can use, for grave with smooth or rough breather, diaresis with acute etc. ( ῍ ), ( ῝ ), ( ΅ )<br />
<br/></p>
<p>Keyboardmaestro is very helpful in that it can keep the &quot;locations&quot; of its own shortcut keys the same across different input keyboards — for example when I use my normal em–space key combination, it is typed using the same physical keys on the keyboard and I don't have to shift gears to use the other alphabet for those shortcuts (I still have to shift for system–integrated i.e. non–keyboardmaestro shortcuts such as copy and paste).<br />
<br/></p>
<p>for rarer accents such as ῑ, ῡ, ᾱ, ῒ, ΐ, ῐ, ᾰ, I use keyboardmaestro macros to insert the characters; for even rarer accents such as ᾱ́, ῑ́, ῡ́, ᾰ́, ῐ́, I also use keyboardmaestro macros but need additionally to use the unicode combining acute ( ́ ) NB you can copy and paste that combining acute into your own macros to use it, or search for &quot;combining acute&quot; in the character viewer and copy from there.<br />
<br/></p>
<p>keyboardmaestro is also very helpful for creating emacs–style bindings for often–used keys combinations that would be awkward to type in sublime text when the keyboard input method is set to greek polytonic, e.g. I set hyper2–l (dvorak equivalent ctrl–n) to do &quot;move cursor down to next line, after inserting a full stop&quot;, hyper2–d (dvorak equivalent ctrl–e) to do &quot;move cursor to end of line&quot;.</p>
