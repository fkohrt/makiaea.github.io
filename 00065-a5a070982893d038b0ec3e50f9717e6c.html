<li>“The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning (2009). A year or two earlier, Lynn Margulis was writing an enthusiastic introduction (“inclusive, tolerant and enlightened”) to a book on Gaia called Animate Earth: Science, Intuition, and Gaia (2006) by Stephan Harding. And then there are The Gaia Project: 2012; The Earth’s Coming Great Changes (2007), by Hwee-Yong Jang (“the Earth is already undergoing a purification process”); and Earthy Realism: The Meaning of Gaia (2007), an edited volume including “Can Gaia Forgive Us,” by Anne Primavesi (“We have hurt, victimized, damaged the more-than-human community of life on Earth. If so, Gaia’s purposes and ours will be served by a repentance that acknowledges the wrong done and effects [sic] change in our lives that will heal relationships with the members of that community”). At a somewhat more practical level, there is Gaia’s Garden, Second Edition: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture (2009), by Toby Hemenway”</li>
<li>“Rupert Sheldrake is even more beyond the pale. He diverted the makings of a brilliant scientific career—double first (first class in two subjects) from Cambridge, research fellow of the Royal Society—into the writing of A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance (1981). The editor of Nature wrote that his book was “an exercise in pseudo science” and asked if this was “a book for burning?” A follow-up book, The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God, has Gaian fingerprints on virtually every page: “Mother Nature is reasserting herself whether we like it or not. In particular, the acknowledgement that our planet is a living organism, Gaia, Mother Earth, strikes a responsive chord in millions of people; it reconnects us both with our personal, intuitive experience of nature and with the traditional understanding of nature as alive” (Sheldrake 1991, 10).”</li>

<p><em>scenario planning with linked land-sea models inform where forest conservation actions will promote coral reef resilience</em><br />
j. m. s. delevaux et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29951-0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29951-0</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We developed a linked land-sea modeling framework based on remote sensing and empirical data, which couples sediment export and coral reef models at fine spatial resolution. This spatially-explicit (60 × 60 m) framework simultaneously tracks changes in multiple benthic and fish indicators as a function of land-use and climate change scenarios. We applied this framework in Kubulau District, Fiji, to investigate the effects of logging, agriculture expansion, and restoration on coral reef resilience. Under the deforestation scenario, models projected a 4.5-fold sediment increase (&gt;7,000 t. yr−1) coupled with a significant decrease in benthic habitat quality across 1,940 ha and a reef fish biomass loss of 60.6 t. Under the restoration scenario, models projected a small (&lt;30 t. yr−1) decrease in exported sediments, resulting in a significant increase in benthic habitat quality across 577 ha and a fish biomass gain of 5.7 t. The decrease in benthic habitat quality and loss of fish biomass were greater when combining climate change and deforestation scenarios. We evaluated where land-use change and bleaching scenarios would impact sediment runoff and downstream coral reefs to identify priority areas on land, where conservation or restoration could promote coral reef resilience in the face of climate change.</li>

<li>Plants can plastically respond to light competition in three strategies, comprising vertical growth, which promotes competitive dominance; shade tolerance, which maximises performance under shade; or lateral growth, which offers avoidance of competition. Here, we test the hypothesis that plants can ‘choose’ between these responses, according to their abilities to competitively overcome their neighbours. We study this hypothesis in the clonal plant <em>Potentilla reptans</em> using an experimental setup that simulates both the height and density of neighbours, thus presenting plants with different light-competition scenarios. <em>Potentilla reptans</em> ramets exhibit the highest vertical growth under simulated short-dense neighbours, highest specific leaf area (leaf area/dry mass) under tall-dense neighbours, and tend to increase total stolon length under tall-sparse neighbours. These responses suggest shifts between ‘confrontational’ vertical growth, shade tolerance and lateral-avoidance, respectively, and provide evidence that plants adopt one of several alternative plastic responses in a way that optimally corresponds to prevailing light-competition scenarios.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tree saplings in temperate forests world-wide experience intense browsing from deer and other mammalian herbivores. However, when compared to insect herbivory, our knowledge about the cues that trigger mammalian-induced defence responses in trees is limited.<br />
We studied responses of field-grown saplings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) to simulated browsing by (i) clipping apical buds or leaves and (ii) additionally applying roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) saliva to the cut surface. We analysed induced changes in phytohormones and phenolics in the saplings’ remaining buds or leaves, respectively.<br />
In both species, jasmonates were activated after clipping of buds and leaves. Importantly, additional saliva application activated salicylic acid in beech leaves and led to increases in cytokinins in beech buds. Saliva application also led to an increased biosynthesis of several hydrolysable tannins (mainly ellagitannins) and flavonols in maple leaves. Condensed tannins, the most abundant phenolics in beech buds and leaves, did not change after either clipping or saliva application. However, clipping with additional saliva application decreased levels of phenolic acids (cinnamic acid derivatives) in beech buds.<br />
We conclude that the two tree species perceive and respond to unknown elicitors in the deer saliva, resulting in changes in phytohormone levels and defence-associated secondary metabolites.<br />
We suggest that variation in induced defence responses between tree species as well as between buds and leaves is related to differences in morphological traits, which interrelate with chemical traits and result in species-specific strategies to respond to mammalian herbivory.</li>

<p><em>spatially-dependent alkyl quinolone signaling responses to antibiotics in pseudomonas aeruginosa swarms</em><br />

<ul>
<li>There is a general lack of understanding about how communities of bacteria respond to exogenous toxins such as antibiotics. Most of our understanding of community-level stress responses comes from the study of stationary biofilm communities. Although several community behaviors and production of specific biomolecules affecting biofilm development and associated behavior have been described for <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other bacteria, we have little appreciation for the production and dispersal of secreted metabolites within the 2D and 3D spaces they occupy as they colonize, spread, and grow on surfaces. Here we specifically studied the phenotypic responses and spatial variability of alkyl quinolones, including the <em>Pseudomonas</em> quinolone signal (PQS) and members of the alkyl hydroxyquinoline (AQNO) subclass, in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> plate-assay swarming communities. We found that PQS production was not a universal signaling response to antibiotics as tobramycin elicited an alkyl quinolone response while carbenicillin did not. We also found that PQS and AQNO profiles in response to tobramycin were markedly distinct and influenced these swarms on different spatial scales. The distribution of alkyl quinolones varied by several orders of magnitude within the same swarm. At some tobramycin exposures, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> swarms produced alkyl quinolones in the range of 150 µM PQS and 400 µM AQNO that accumulated as aggregates. Our collective findings show that the distribution of alkyl quinolones can vary by several orders of magnitude within the same swarming community.  More notably, our results suggest that multiple intercellular signals acting on different spatial scales can be triggered by one common cue.</li>

<p>The transcription factor bZIP63 binds and regulates the circadian clock gene <em>PRR7</em><br />
bZIP63 is required for adjustment of circadian period by sugars<br />
Trehalose-6-phosphate metabolism and KIN10 signaling regulate circadian period<br />
Sugar signals establish the correct circadian phase in light and dark cycles</p>
<p>Synchronization of circadian clocks to the day-night cycle ensures the correct timing of biological events. This entrainment process is essential to ensure that the phase of the circadian oscillator is synchronized with daily events within the environment <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_simard_how_trees_talk_to_each_other#t-63012">1</a>, to permit accurate anticipation of environmental changes [2, 3]. Entrainment in plants requires phase changes in the circadian oscillator, through unidentified pathways, which alter circadian oscillator gene expression in response to light, temperature, and sugars [4, 5, 6]. To determine how circadian clocks respond to metabolic rhythms, we investigated the mechanisms by which sugars adjust the circadian phase in <em>Arabidopsis</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant">5</a>. We focused upon metabolic regulation because interactions occur between circadian oscillators and metabolism in several experimental systems [5, 7, 8, 9], but the molecular mechanisms are unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER63 (bZIP63) regulates the circadian oscillator gene <em>PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR7</em> (<em>PRR7</em>) to change the circadian phase in response to sugars. We find that SnRK1, a sugar-sensing kinase that regulates bZIP63 activity and circadian period [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] is required for sucrose-induced changes in circadian phase. Furthermore, TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 (TPS1), which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-phosphate, is required for circadian phase adjustment in response to sucrose. We demonstrate that daily rhythms of energy availability can entrain the circadian oscillator through the function of bZIP63, TPS1, and the KIN10 subunit of the SnRK1 energy sensor. This identifies a molecular mechanism that adjusts the circadian phase in response to sugars.</p>

ClC transporters operate in the Cl− sequestration into vacuoles of bladder cells<br />

On the transcript level, bladders are “constitutively active” for salt sequestration</p>
<p>Soil salinity is destroying arable land and is considered to be one of the major threats to global food security in the 21st century. Therefore, the ability of naturally salt-tolerant halophyte plants to sequester large quantities of salt in external structures, such as epidermal bladder cells (EBCs), is of great interest. Using <em>Chenopodium quinoa</em>, a pseudo-cereal halophyte of great economic potential, we have shown previously that, upon removal of salt bladders, quinoa becomes salt sensitive. In this work, we analyzed the molecular mechanism underlying the unique salt dumping capabilities of bladder cells in quinoa. The transporters differentially expressed in the EBC transcriptome and functional electrophysiological testing of key EBC transporters in <em>Xenopus</em> oocytes revealed that loading of Na+ and Cl− into EBCs is mediated by a set of tailored plasma and vacuole membrane-based sodium-selective channel and chloride-permeable transporter.</p>

<li>Charcoal is a major component of the stable soil organic carbon reservoir, and the physical and chemical properties of charcoal can sometimes significantly alter bulk soil properties (e.g., by increasing soil water holding capacity). However, our understanding of the residence time of soil charcoal remains uncertain, with old measured soil charcoal ages in apparent conflict with relatively short modeled and measured residence times. These discrepancies may exist because the fate of charcoal on the landscape is a function not just of its resistance to biological decomposition but also its physical mobility. Mobility may be important in controlling charcoal landscape residence time and may artificially inflate estimates of its degradability, but few studies have examined charcoal vulnerability to physical redistribution. Charcoal landscape redistribution is likely higher than other organic carbon fractions owing to charcoal’s low bulk density, typically less than 1.0 g/cm3. Here we examine both the physical and chemical properties of soil and charcoal over a period of two years following a 2011 wildfire in Texas. We find little change in properties with time; however, we find evidence of enhanced mobility of charcoal relative to other forms of soil organic matter. These data add to a growing body of evidence that charcoal is preferentially eroded, offering another explanation for variations observed in its environmental residence times.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the highlands of southern Brazil an anthropogenitcally driven expansion of forest occurred at the expense of grasslands between 1410 and 900 cal BP, coincident with a period of demographic and cultural change in the region. Previous studies have debated the relative contributions of increasing wetter and warmer climate conditions and human landscape modifications to forest expansion, but generally lacked high resoltiuon proxies to measure these effects, or have relied on single proxies to reconstruct both climate and vegetation. Here, we develop and test a model of natural ecosystem distribution against vegetation histories, paleoclimate proxies, and the archaeological record to distinguish human from temperature and precipitation impacts on the distribution and expansion of <em>Araucaria</em> forests during the late Holocene. Carbon isotopes from soil profiles confirm that in spite of climatic fluctuations, vegetation was stable and forests were spatially limited to south-facing slopes in the absence of human inputs. In contrast, forest management strategies for the past 1400 years expanded this economically important forest beyond its natural geographic boundaries in areas of dense pre-Columbian occupation, suggesting that landscape modifications were linked to demographic changes, the effects of which are still visible today.</li>

<ul>
<li>In tropical regions, fires propagate readily in grasslands but typically consume only edges of forest patches. Thus, forest patches grow due to tree propagation and shrink by fires in surrounding grasslands. The interplay between these competing edge effects is unknown, but critical in determining the shape and stability of individual forest patches, as well the landscape‐level spatial distribution and stability of forests. We analyze high‐resolution remote‐sensing data from protected Brazilian Cerrado areas and find that forest shapes obey a robust perimeter–area scaling relation across climatic zones. We explain this scaling by introducing a heterogeneous fire propagation model of tropical forest‐grassland ecotones. Deviations from this perimeter–area relation determine the stability of individual forest patches. At a larger scale, our model predicts that the relative rates of tree growth due to propagative expansion and long‐distance seed dispersal determine whether collapse of regional‐scale tree cover is continuous or discontinuous as fire frequency changes.</li>

<li>“The ancients revered the frightful sway of the goddess Fortuna, aware, in their own way, that the presiding powers of history seem to be a volatile mix of structure and chance, laws of nature and sheer luck. The Romans lived at a fateful juncture in the human story, and the civilization they built was, in ways the Romans could not have imagined, the victim both of its own success and the caprice of the environment. The enduring power of the Romans to enchant us derives, at least in part, from the poignancy of our knowledge that they stood on the invisible edge of unsuspected change. The long, intertwined story of humanity and nature is full of paradox, surprise, and blind chance. That is why the particularity of history matters. Nature, like humanity, is cunning, but constrained by the circumstances of the past. Our story, and the story of the planet, are inseparable.”</li>

<li>Though fear appeals have largely been the default emotional appeal to motivate prosocial behaviors, research indicates that other emotionally charged messages, like those using humor, may also be effective. We conducted an experiment to compare the effects of fear and humor appeals on climate change-related behavioral intentions and perceived risk of climate change. We randomly assigned young adults to view one of three videos about climate change (fear, humor, informational) or a control video. Compared to control, viewing the fear or humor appeal produced greater climate change activism intentions, but only the fear appeal directly affected risk perceptions. Mediation analyses highlighted tradeoffs for fear and humor appeals, and moderation analyses demonstrated an age-by-appeal interaction effect on intentions and perceived risk.</li>

Here we show, by quantifying the growth of 541 tropical tree species across a steep natural phosphorus gradient in Panama, that phosphorus limitation is widespread at the level of individual species and strengthens markedly below a threshold of two parts per million exchangeable soil phosphate. However, this pervasive species-specific phosphorus limitation does not translate into a community-wide response, because some species grow rapidly on infertile soils despite extremely low phosphorus availability. These results redefine our understanding of nutrient limitation in diverse plant communities and have important implications for attempts to predict the response of tropical forests to environmental change.</li>

<li>Auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development, but the causal relationship between hormone transport and root responses remains unresolved. Here we describe auxin uptake, together with early steps in signaling, in <em>Arabidopsis</em> root hairs. Using intracellular microelectrodes we show membrane depolarization, in response to IAA in a concentration- and pH-dependent manner. This depolarization is strongly impaired in <em>aux1</em> mutants, indicating that AUX1 is the major transporter for auxin uptake in root hairs. Local intracellular auxin application triggers Ca2+ signals that propagate as long-distance waves between root cells and modulate their auxin responses. AUX1-mediated IAA transport, as well as IAA- triggered calcium signals, are blocked by treatment with the SCFTIR1/AFB - inhibitor auxinole. Further, they are strongly reduced in the <em>tir1afb2afb3</em> and the <em>cngc14</em> mutant. Our study reveals that the AUX1 transporter, the SCFTIR1/AFB receptor and the CNGC14 Ca2+ channel, mediate fast auxin signaling in roots.</li>

Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels. The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf.</li>

<ul>
<li>Vegetative dormancy, that is the temporary absence of aboveground growth for ≥ 1 year, is paradoxical, because plants cannot photosynthesise or flower during dormant periods. We test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for its widespread persistence. We show that dormancy has evolved numerous times. Most species displaying dormancy exhibit life‐history costs of sprouting, and of dormancy. Short‐lived and mycoheterotrophic species have higher proportions of dormant plants than long‐lived species and species with other nutritional modes. Foliage loss is associated with higher future dormancy levels, suggesting that carbon limitation promotes dormancy. Maximum dormancy duration is shorter under higher precipitation and at higher latitudes, the latter suggesting an important role for competition or herbivory. Study length affects estimates of some demographic parameters. Our results identify life historical and environmental drivers of dormancy. We also highlight the evolutionary importance of the little understood costs of sprouting and growth, latitudinal stress gradients and mixed nutritional modes.</li>

•The lignin brace spatially restricts cell wall breakdown<br />
•Lignin deposition ensures surface integrity of transdifferentiated epidermal cells</p>
<p>The cell wall, a defining feature of plants, provides a rigid structure critical for bonding cells together. To overcome this physical constraint, plants must process cell wall linkages during growth and development. However, little is known about the mechanism guiding cell-cell detachment and cell wall remodeling. Here, we identify two neighboring cell types in Arabidopsis that coordinate their activities to control cell wall processing, thereby ensuring precise abscission to discard organs. One cell type produces a honeycomb structure of lignin, which acts as a mechanical “brace” to localize cell wall breakdown and spatially limit abscising cells. The second cell type undergoes transdifferentiation into epidermal cells, forming protective cuticle, demonstrating de novo specification of epidermal cells, previously thought to be restricted to embryogenesis. Loss of the lignin brace leads to inadequate cuticle formation, resulting in surface barrier defects and susceptible to infection. Together, we show how plants precisely accomplish abscission.</p>

Primarily occurring in the Americas, its recent discovery in Asia and Europe demonstrates that <em>X. fastidiosa</em>’s geographic range has broadened considerably, positioning it as a reemerging global threat that has caused socioeconomic and cultural damage<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0189-7#ref-CR7">22</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0189-7#ref-CR8">8</a>. <em>X. fastidiosa</em> can infect more than 350 plant species worldwide<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0189-7#ref-CR9">9</a>, and early detection is critical for its eradication<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0189-7#ref-CR8">8</a>. In this article, we show that changes in plant functional traits retrieved from airborne imaging spectroscopy and thermography can reveal <em>X. fastidiosa</em> infection in olive trees before symptoms are visible. We obtained accuracies of disease detection, confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, exceeding 80% when high-resolution fluorescence quantified by three-dimensional simulations and thermal stress indicators were coupled with photosynthetic traits sensitive to rapid pigment dynamics and degradation. Moreover, we found that the visually asymptomatic trees originally scored as affected by spectral plant-trait alterations, developed <em>X. fastidiosa</em> symptoms at almost double the rate of the asymptomatic trees classified as not affected by remote sensing. We demonstrate that spectral plant-trait alterations caused by <em>X. fastidiosa</em> infection are detectable previsually at the landscape scale, a critical requirement to help eradicate some of the most devastating plant diseases worldwide.</li>

<p><em>transient phenomena in ecology</em><br />
alan hastings et al. 2018<br />

<li>Ecological systems sometimes experience sudden changes in their properties or function which often results in species extinction and significant loss of biodiversity.<br />
Understanding why these significant changes occur remains a challenge, in particular because transitions often happen under apparently steady, constant conditions and therefore cannot be directly linked to a specific environmental change.<br />
By bringing together empirical data, insights from ecological theory and mathematical models, the team has revealed that abrupt transitions in an ecosystem can occur as a result of long-term transient dynamics, including ‘ghost attractors’ and ‘crawl-bys’.<br />
An attractor is an ‘end-state’ of a given ecosystem, that is where it expected to be found over an infinitely long period of time and/or where it returns after small perturbations.<br />
A ‘ghost attractor’ is a special configuration of a dynamical system that exhibits the same behaviour as an attractor but only for a finite time within an ecosystem. After that time, the system would normally experience a fast evolution or transition to another state which can have very different properties. Such transition would therefore correspond to a catastrophe or major ecological shift.<br />
‘Crawl-bys’, on the other hand, exist when changes to the dynamic of an ecosystem happen slowly over a long period of time.<br />
Professor Petrovskii explained: “An ecological catastrophe emerging from a ‘ghost attractor’ or a ‘crawl-by’ may be a debt that we have to pay for the actions or mistakes — for example unsustainable use of natural resources — made many generations ago.<br />
“Our research shows that a healthy ecosystem will not necessarily remain healthy, even in the absence of any significant environmental change. Therefore, better monitoring of the state of an ecosystem is required to mitigate potential disasters.<br />
“We also can predict an approaching catastrophe in the sense that our study advises where to look for its signs and what is the relevant time scale: the environmental change (whether it is natural or human-made) that will finally lead to big changes might have happened a very long time ago.<br />
“These findings create a new paradigm as well as a powerful theoretical framework for understanding — and potentially predicting — ecological catastrophes and for their efficient management.”</li>

<p><em>a separated vortex ring underlies the flight of the dandelion</em><br />
cathal cummins et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0604-2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0604-2</a></p>

<li>Wind-dispersed plants have evolved ingenious ways to lift their seeds<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0604-2#ref-CR1">23</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0604-2#ref-CR2">24</a>. The common dandelion uses a bundle of drag-enhancing bristles (the pappus) that helps to keep their seeds aloft. This passive flight mechanism is highly effective, enabling seed dispersal over formidable distances<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0604-2#ref-CR3">25</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0604-2#ref-CR4">26</a>; however, the physics underpinning pappus-mediated flight remains unresolved. Here we visualized the flow around dandelion seeds, uncovering an extraordinary type of vortex. This vortex is a ring of recirculating fluid, which is detached owing to the flow passing through the pappus. We hypothesized that the circular disk-like geometry and the porosity of the pappus are the key design features that enable the formation of the separated vortex ring. The porosity gradient was surveyed using microfabricated disks, and a disk with a similar porosity was found to be able to recapitulate the flow behaviour of the pappus. The porosity of the dandelion pappus appears to be tuned precisely to stabilize the vortex, while maximizing aerodynamic loading and minimizing material requirements. The discovery of the separated vortex ring provides evidence of the existence of a new class of fluid behaviour around fluid-immersed bodies that may underlie locomotion, weight reduction and particle retention in biological and manmade structures.</li>
