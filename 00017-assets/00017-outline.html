Our response to threats and scarcity may have been adaptive, on a small scale in dire emergencies and even then the effect was limited by the small reach of humans. But to speculate on this may not be worthwhile, as there might not be an answer to find. What we need to deal with is the huge abusive effect that our human selfishness causes now in the world, because our cumulative impact is now so massive.</li></ul><li>people do not intend to become abusive. people slowly build up bad habits and attitudes that lead to worse things. the same is true of good things however.</li><ul><li>It is not that people are evil; even well–meaning people do harm when they don&apos;t try to understand what they do. It isn&apos;t their prejudice or your difference from them, it is a lack of care that is innate because they are not ready. </li></ul><li>with beauty and power too, the privileged are more often irresponsible in their behaviour. it is often interesting to see how people behave towards you when they believe you are not as privileged as they are.</li><li>there are those who believe that having understood a part of reality, they are entitled to exploit those that do not understand. is this the basic moral failing? where someone with a temporary advantage uses it to gain continued advantage? </li><ul><li>we need to understand that there will always be people like this. but that does not mean we should let them take power over us.</li></ul><li>people have a justification system for their beliefs and behaviours. one that allows them to say that the victims that they make deserve their fates. </li><ul><li>what causes this? is it because of an imposed or self–imposed scarcity, a paucity of options? </li><li>this is the link between belief, choice, and action, how they are really part of the same thing.</li></ul><li>imagine if you were under a spell to forget everything after three minutes. or to reject everything that you experience as unreal. that is the kind of spell that billions of people in the world have fallen under. </li><li>abuse, is, at heart, the inability to reconcile our inner representation of reality — with reality as it truly is. </li><ul><li>because reality changes, we must change our inner representations of it to match. the problem comes when we no longer do so. this is why change, and momentum — the flow of change — are such essential ideas and skills. </li><li>Pride is a limitation for learning.<br/>An unprepared enemy can still overwhelm you.<br/>Pride and sloth are addictions, excuses not to face reality.</li></ul><li>when we understand we are all very fallible, we no longer fit into abusive societies that reward fake certainty. thus we need to build our own society. </li><li>abusive people accrete power by destroying the ability of others to defend themselves. in so doing, they make their own downfall a certainty. </li><li>so basically the problems in the world come down to the same thing. how do we deal with a person who behaves abusively, and they are our supposed guardians, our partners, and ourselves? </li><ul><li>and the corollary is how do we live, purposefully, joyfully, compassionately? </li></ul><li>what kind of society is it that produces abusers? </li><li>all people blind to (truly unaware of) our own mistakes — otherwise why would we still be making them? but essential difference is our current awareness of this something–of–which–we–cannot–be–aware, and what we do about it. <br/><br/>we might argue that we know what needs to be done, or that circumstances are beyond our control, but the question simply becomes: why do we not act to change our lives for the better? </li><li>and what I see is abusive people enslaved by abusive ideas, seeking to enslave others — abused and manipulated people who perpetuate this cycle of abuse</li><li>power relations work by demonising some section of people</li><ul><li>so we would be no better if we demonised people who are abusive</li></ul><li>the idea of the division of labour leads to institutions and concentration of power. not all bad, even if does often seem so.</li><ul><li>extractive relations rather than sharing relations may be what lead to tragedy of commons in the first place. instead of believing good will come back, we create the bad with each extraction and exploitation. </li></ul><li>The human military, like its science or religion or politics, is a tool which human society uses to perpetuate itself. These tools, like human society and civilisation, are not abusive because we can see what they do, but because the concentration of power, in almost any form, is a poison.</li><li>could it be that too much self–absorption is the root cause? when we are so concerned with our selves that we neglect the effect of our actions on others, and take offence at others&apos; actions because they are not ideal for us, then we start to become more irresponsible and abusive.</li><li>is this why power corrupts, because we lose our capacity to review our actions, when we remove those who would point out we are no longer right?</li><li>given that people do behave abusively sometimes, and some more often and more deeply than we can bear at that time, how do we comport ourselves? when we meet more people, the proportion of abusive actions we encounter may stay the &quot;same&quot; but the effect on us may be disproportionately large – it is not proportions of abuse but abuse itself that affects us. also, abuse can be very deep and extreme, even life–threatening. how do we deal with this? it is tempting to withdraw, just to not expose ourselves to those people acting abusively. however, this way can never, by definition, lead to a responsible society. we can build shields and weapons against abuse, but these can lead to problems too – general loss of sensitivity instead of specific protection against abuse, weapons readied and used when inappropriate and unnecessary.</li><li>i hate being right, because they believed that if they admitted I was right, then they would be shown to be wrong, and that this would be bad. why did they think being right was so important?</li><ul><li>self protection from remorse: if someone spends many years doing something, and believed that they needed to deliberately sacrifice in order to do this, would it not be devastating to face the possibility that all they did was for naught, or resulted in furthering someone else&apos;s ends rather than their own, or even badly abused others for the sake of selfish, irresponsible reasons?</li><li>self protection for status: in that culture, it was taught that to be right was to be good, and to be wrong was evil –– if you admitted you were wrong, or that you could be or had been wrong, it was implied that you would always be wrong, and even that you were evil and must be cast out and despised. why was this taught? because it was the mechanism used to abuse power. by inculcating this in people, the abusers maintained they were right and good and to be given power, and thus that their opponents were wrong and evil and must be killed. the people were to believe this to be true, to be correct, to be right; for to doubt, or question, or believe otherwise was wrong, evil, and deserving of retribution.</li><li>so the system of ethics in a culture, maintained by a society, can enable abusive people to take power away from others, withhold and wield it. this is why understanding of ethics is practical, if one wishes to wield power responsibly, and to fight abuse.</li><li>interestingly, to accept responsibility is to also accept that one has power. is this because responsibility is the name for what we expect when power is given –– that the receiver is to use the power for responsible acts?</li><li>why do so many people want to be right? because there is a spell which binds them to believe that to be worthy, they must be right. </li></ul><li>in a gang, like any other longstanding organisation, there must be some factors keeping it together. with a gang, this might be the leader, but is often someone else, a sly, devious type, who controls and manipulates an leader who has integrity and honour (although his actions outside of the gang would speak otherwise, within the gang he provides a binding force)</li><ul><li>since the sly devious one cannot maintain a group by himself, he makes or finds a group on which to prey. the key to dissolving gangs is to stop and divert these devious ones from the path they perhaps unwittingly chose.  </li></ul><li>petty tyrants and ogres are not outliers, anomalies in human existence. they are just examples of human possibility. </li><li>there will always be people who try to game the system, who abuse the privileges given them in the expectation of responsible behaviour. that is no reason to ditch a system. abusive people may try to use this as an excuse to promote their own agenda. </li><li>how do situations arise and how do we perpetuate them? how do abusers manage to continue their abuse, when the people they abuse (one would initially think) could escape?</li><ul><li>it may be that the differing models of behaviour, fearful and trusting, are suitable to different societal conditions, i.e. chaos and order. the mechanisms abusive people use to perpetuate a condition that is fruitful (at least in the short term) for them but inimical to others.</li></ul><li>abusive irresponsible people want to hold back tide like king canute in story. fritter away resources for their own selfish gain. their manipulative opposition on evolution, on climate change, on facts of life, are only possible because of structure of politics shielding them from the consequences of their irresponsibility.</li><ul><li>just like an incompetent “team member” who insists they are right.</li><li>when they resist the tide, they will end up washed up on the harsh shores of reality. </li></ul><li>human arrogance is what I call the ability of humans to dismiss others. to believe that they are correct and to believe that if others cannot convince them otherwise then they need do nothing.</li><ul><li>by that measure Cambridge is full of arrogant people. </li><li>We dislike arrogance because it shows a person is not willing to learn at that time. This may be the major problem with our time. Even though the now–massive problems that need to be solved require a now–massive effort from all of us to learn, understand, and deal with the problem, there are currently some people who don&apos;t want to learn. In all ages they are present but in the current one some of them hold influence and power and still refuse to move.<br/>This is the reason that concentration of power is bad, because it multiplies the effect of people acting irresponsibly.<br/>The reason religion can become bad is because by definition, religion is regarded as the highest authority. Religious abusers believe that the rules of human society do not apply to them, because they obey a higher law, that which is revealed to them in their religion. This would be okay if the higher law was still true, but unfortunately an unchanging higher law becomes false very quickly, and the higher law then becomes a tool for abusing others.<br/>After four thousand years of transcription I wouldn&apos;t wonder if even the best message gets distorted. We can&apos;t lay blame at the feet of a few religions. Can we really expect that nothing would have happened in the meantime? If not this, then something else would have happened.<br/>So what should we do?

That transparency would shield them against groupthink, enabling them to avoid countless bad decisions over time. By building a culture in which people are constantly encouraging one another to disagree, Dalio has created a powerful way to combat conformity. Yet the kind of disagreement he seeks is the opposite of what most leaders invite.</li><li>Hofmann found that a culture that focuses too heavily on solutions becomes a culture of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you’re always expected to have an answer ready, you’ll arrive at meetings with your diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to learn from a broad range of perspectives. </li><li>Ray Dalio doesn’t want employees to bring him solutions; he expects them to bring him problems. One of his first inventions was the issue log, an open-access database for employees to flag any problem they identify and to rate its severity. Getting problems noted is half the battle against groupthink; the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. The Bridgewater procedure for the latter is to gather a group of credible people to diagnose the problems, share their reasoning, and explore the causes and possible solutions.<br/><br/>Although everyone’s opinions are welcome, they’re not all valued equally. Bridgewater is not a democracy. Voting privileges the majority, when the minority might have a better opinion. “Democratic decision making—one person, one vote—is dumb,” Dalio explains, “because not everybody has the same believability.”*<br/><br/>At Bridgewater, every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. In sports, statistics for every player’s performance history are public. In baseball, before you sign a player, you can look up his batting average, home runs, and steals; assess his strengths and weaknesses; and adjust accordingly. Dalio wanted Bridgewater to work the same way, so he created baseball cards that display statistics on every employee’s performance, which can be accessed by anyone at the company. If you’re about to interact with a few Bridgewater colleagues for the first time, you can see their track records on seventy-seven different dimensions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, and organization and reliability.<br/><br/>During regular review cycles, employees rate one another on different qualities like integrity, courage, living in truth, taking the bull by its horns, not tolerating problems, being willing to touch a nerve, fighting to get in sync, and holding people accountable. Between cycles, employees can give real-time, open feedback to anyone in the company. At any time, employees can submit dots, or observations—they assess peers, leaders, or subordinates on the metrics and give short explanations of what they’ve observed. The baseball cards create a “pointillist picture” of staff members, aggregating across review cycles and dots, and incorporate various assessments that employees take. The cards’ display changes over time, revealing who’s best suited to play each position, and flagging areas to “rely on” and “watch out for” with green and red lights.<br/><br/>When you express an opinion, it’s weighted by whether you’ve established yourself as believable on that dimension. Your believability is a probability of being right in the present, and is based on your judgment, reasoning, and behavior in the past. In presenting your views, you’re expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts, and you’re not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn’t have an opinion in the first place; you’re supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you’re expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright about it—but know that your colleagues will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you’re supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time. As management scholar Karl Weick advises, “Argue like you’re right and listen like you’re wrong.”-</li><ul><li>What happens, though, when believable people don’t agree? In the summer of 2014, Bridgewater conducted an anonymous survey to find out about dissent that hadn’t been voiced. When co-CEO Greg Jensen led an all-hands meeting to discuss the results, an employee, “Ashley,” commented that some people were misinterpreting Bridgewater’s principles. Greg asked if she was correcting them when that occurred, and Ashley mentioned that she had recently called someone out for a misinterpretation.<br/><br/>By speaking up, Ashley was exemplifying one of Bridgewater’s principles. But rather than responding to the substance of her comment, Greg called her out for violating another Bridgewater principle, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between the forest and the trees, and navigating between the two. He wanted a synthesis of how she handled such situations in general, not her account of a specific case.<br/><br/>A senior manager, Trina Soske, felt that Greg made a bad leadership decision. Although he was attempting to adhere to one Bridgewater principle, Trina was concerned that Ashley—and others—might be discouraged from speaking up in the future. In most organizations, since Greg had higher status than her, a manager in Trina’s position would remain silent and go home thinking he was a jerk. But Trina wrote honest feedback for the whole company to read. She praised Ashley for having the courage and integrity to speak up, and cautioned Greg that his response “signaled the exact opposite of what you, as a CEO, should model.”<br/><br/>In a typical organization, as the senior leader Greg’s opinion would prevail over Trina’s, and her career might be in jeopardy for criticizing him. But at Bridgewater, Trina wasn’t punished, and the resolution wasn’t based on authority, seniority, majority, or who spoke the most loudly or forcefully. It started with a debate via email: Greg disagreed with Trina’s views, as he felt he was being open and direct; after all, principle three stated that no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up. But Trina had heard two different people criticize Greg’s behavior in informal conversations. “The dampening impact is going to be more about what you don’t see and don’t hear,” she wrote to him. She worried that Greg’s behavior would instigate groupthink, causing people to stay silent rather than to challenge leaders. Greg stood his ground: By allowing people to talk behind his back, Trina was failing to hold people accountable for confronting him with their critical opinions. She was allowing them to violate one of Bridgewater’s principles by acting like “slimy weasels.”<br/><br/>It’s extremely rare to see a senior leader open to this kind of thoughtful disagreement, but even more unusual was what Greg did next. “I doubt we’ll be able to resolve this ourselves,” he wrote to Trina, copying the entire management committee—a group of people who had established their believability as leaders. “It’s like agreeing on a judge or a mediator,” Dalio explains. By escalating the disagreement to them, Greg was allowing the idea meritocracy to sort out who was right.<br/><br/>Instead of leaving it to the management committee to resolve, though, Dalio asked Greg and Trina to collaborate on turning their conflict into a case to share with all of Bridgewater. Along with making their debate transtransparent, it forced them to inquire about each other’s perspectives instead of just advocating for their own viewpoints. When the case was finished, to continue the inquiry process Greg and Trina each generated questions to ask the entire company.<br/><br/>Several months after the issue first occurred, it was still being discussed, and the analytics team was preparing to share the data on employees’ reactions. But “resolving the issue itself is in some ways less important than understanding the path to resolving such things in the future, and agreeing on that,” Zack Wieder explains. “No one (including our CEO) has any monopoly on the truth.”</li></ul><li>It’s not just Dalio’s openness that makes people comfortable challenging senior leaders. It’s the fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced, Bridgewater reveals that we can start encouraging originality on day one. In most organizations, the socialization period is passive: We’re busy learning the ropes and familiarizing ourselves with the culture. By the time we’re up to speed, we’re already swamped with work and beginning to see the world in the company way. The early period is the perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture.</li><li> A principle is just some type of event happening over and over again, and how to deal with that event. Life consists of billions of these events, and if you can go from those billions to 250, you can make the connection, ‘Ah, this is one of those ’</li><li>he explained that he favored the debate format between believable people, because it was the fastest way to reach the right answer and it enabled them to learn from each other’s reasoning. He had been testing out different cultural practices at Bridgewater for years, and although they’re not controlled experiments, he felt he’d seen enough to have a good sense of what works. He believes that thoughtful disagreement between experts creates an efficient marketplace of ideas, where the best ones emerge over time.<br/><br/>this is my feeling in a nutshell</li><li>driven and imaginative, but I was intrigued by three other qualities on Dalio’s list. “Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear of failing.<br/><br/>Dalio himself fits this description, and the hurdle facing him now is to find another shaper to fill his shoes. If he doesn’t, Bridgewater may vanish like Polaroid’s instant pictures. But Dalio knows that preventing groupthink is about more than the vision of a single leader. The greatest shapers don’t stop at introducing originality into the world. They create cultures that unleash originality in others.</li><li>an illustration of why we have and must use diverse capabilities at different times <br/><br/>When we’re not yet committed to a particular action, thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous. Since we don’t have our hearts set on charging ahead, envisioning a dismal failure will only activate anxiety, triggering the stop system and slamming our brakes. By looking on the bright side, we’ll activate enthusiasm and turn on the go system.<br/><br/>But once we’ve settled on a course of action, when anxieties creep in, it’s better to think like a defensive pessimist and confront them directly. In this case instead of attempting to turn worries and doubts into positive emotions, we can shift the go system into higher gear by embracing our fear. Since we’ve set our minds to press forward, envisioning the worst-case scenario enables us to harness anxiety as a source of motivation to prepare and succeed. Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more terrifying than the negative. As Julie Norem describes it, once people have imagined the worst, “they feel more in control. In some sense, they’ve peaked in anxiety before their actual performance. By the time they get to the event itself they’ve taken care of almost everything.”</li><li>fighting pluralistic ignorance <br/><br/>When Popovic trained the Egyptian activists, he shared a story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike, they issued a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon, pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars and trucks at a glacial pace. In his inspiring book Blueprint for Revolution, Popovic explains that prior to these activities:<br/><br/>People were afraid to talk openly about despising Pinochet, so if you hated the dictator, you might have imagined that you were the only one. Tactics like these, Chileans used to say, made people realize that “we are the many and they are the few.” And the beauty was that there was no risk involved: Not even in North Korea was it illegal for cars to drive slowly <br/><br/></li><li>Popovic sees a role for amusement wherever fear runs rampant. Instead of trying to decelerate the stop system, he uses laughter to rev up the go system. When you have no power, it’s a powerful way to convert strong negative emotions into positive ones.</li><li>If you want people to modify their behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing? According to Peter Salovey, one of the originators of the concept of emotional intelligence and now the president of Yale, it depends on whether they perceive the new behavior as safe or risky. If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it—they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. They’re already comfortable with the status quo, so the benefits of change aren’t attractive, and the stop system kicks in. Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and accentuate the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. The prospect of a certain loss brings the go system online.</li><li>this is the beauty of the plague inc “destroy” model <br/><br/>This “kill the company” exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain-framed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating about innovation opportunities, the leaders weren’t inclined to take risks. When they considered how their competitors could put them out of business, they realized that it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation was apparent.<br/><br/>To counter apathy, most change agents focus on presenting an inspiring vision of the future. This is an important message to convey, but it’s not the type of communication that should come first. If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with the present. To drive people out of their comfort zones, you have to cultivate dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger at the current state of affairs, making it a guaranteed loss. “The greatest communicators of all time,” says communication expert Nancy Duarte—who has spent her career studying the shape of superb presentations—start by establishing “what is: here’s the status quo.” Then, they “compare that to what could be,” making “that gap as big as possible.”</li></ul><li>commons</li><ul><li>the tragedy of the commons is a problem with no solution, literally. because garrett hardin defines commons as a place where all can do anything without restriction or responsibility. thus it is not surprising that he finds that what will happen in such a place is exactly as he defines it. </li><li>all refuted yet the paper resonates because it has some truth. people are using the earth as a commons not because they rationally justify it to themselves, but because they wish not to understand that they should act differently. the form of why they should act differently is given by hardin as coercion. </li></ul><li>some of my very best friends i know may never fully understand ecology. that&apos;s okay.</li><ul><li>the problem is those people who have taken power who will not understand in time. what is to be done about them?</li><li>to believe only that awareness will solve is naive.</li><li>in a way the situation will resolve itself. if we do nothing, the system will collapse of its own accord. and there will be great suffering. but if we wish to lessen suffering, what can we do?</li><li>first of all we must eliminate violent reactions. killing or punishment has never solved the world&apos;s problems and never will. we are not asking people to abandon anger and hatred of abuse, we just ask that the anger and hatred be directed only at abusive behaviour rather than at abusive people. </li><li>now there will still be people who believe in violent means, and despite what we say or do they will be violent. in this they become the same as the violent oppressors and perpetuate the cycle of oppression no matter how noble their intention.</li><li>yes we are in fact calling for a world-wide enlightenment, even though we know some people will not make it in time. and it may be true that this may not change the world enough to avoid catastrophe. jared diamond in his book, collapse, was not saying the whole story of the easter islanders who destroyed their own island home and civilisation. it was not necessary for the last generation to be abusive. it was only necessary for the last-but-one generation to do so, and the fate of the civilisation had been decided.</li><li>we are not the last generation of this civilisation, but we may very well be the last-but-one. we bear the burdens of our ancestors and it may be too great a burden to lift. but we bear too the hope of those to come, and that is something worth living for.</li></ul><li>why can it difficult to deal with abusive people? unfortunately they have different understanding of what is reasonable; by definition they are acting selfishly when we would expect them to be more considerate. unless we know they have a history of being abusive, we might not trust our judgement that they are abusive — in effect we are treating them as we would like to be treated, as a normal person who may just have some problems. unfortunately when we deal with an abusive person, they are unlike a normal person and treating them with consideration does not produce a good result. they will take advantage of your kindness, not because they are evil but because they they don&apos;t know how to behave better. so to preserve our sanity we need to communicate with them in a way they will understand. there may not be an easy way to do this as each person who acts abusively is abusive in their own way and to communicate you will need to understand their version of reality. one way is to say, &quot;that was mean,&quot; after they do something mean.</li><ul><li>with responsible people this is much easier, because responsible people bring their own resources and act to understand your version of reality too; they are team players who play their part in a two–way communication. with an abusive person, the effort is only one way.</li><li>how do we determine if a person is abusive or not? you can see if they are abusive by their actions. everything they do will point towards their version of reality, and show how it may be distorted.</li></ul><li>is the inability or lack of adequate ability to understand consequences of our behaviour a major factor in why humans act abusively?</li><ul><li>and the different kinds of abuser acting concurrently that make the situation seem intractable? if so would it be an advantage to identify the major types of abuser?</li></ul></ul><li>shaina</li><ul><li>05017<span style="font-size: 10pt;
