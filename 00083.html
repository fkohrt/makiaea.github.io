<h2>wellesbourne river under london road</h2>
<h2>attend talk on prof’s paper</h2>
<h2>The cold air rushes in as I push the bicycle out the front door. Carrying it down the steps is a little awkward as the wires for the brakes are on the undersides of the frame, and I have yet to find good handholds from which to lift it. A glance and listen to left and right, push off into the road. Turning on to the main road, the downhill slope gives me speed and the cold wind chills my bare legs. Whose bright idea is it to wear shorts to get some sun in the winter? No matter, the velodrome is just ahead. Take a short lap around the track and dismount to start the run. On my feet, I feel warmer and safe enough to let my attention drift from the tarmac in front to the green fence and flint rock wall to the side, to the silhouette of the trees against the grey sky above promising rain. Doing more sprints than I'd intended, each lap slightly different</h2>
<h2>The trees were tall, and my daughter wanted to touch the leaves. Higher, she babbled, higher! I could not lift her higher, and I was humbled. But I was joyful too, for one day she would touch the stars.</h2>
<h2>I am on a sand bridge and the breakers crash over the way ahead. I hesitate to move into the spray where I cannot know the safety of the path. I hold in my hands a small branch to probe the sand for weakness.</h2>
<h2>unlikely heroes of an evolution</h2>
<p>on the evolution of heroes in the age of solar</p>
<h2>heroes, like magic and demons, don't exist — their human equivalents do. demons don't exist, but their human equivalent… step too close to the abyss… but you don't need this warning, you're already prepared.</h2>
<h2>good story about a bad story</h2>
<h2>night entry separated and safe from normal, just like dream</h2>
<h2>body on high alert, something is going down</h2>
<h2>speaking for those who cannot yet speak for themselves</h2>
<h2>we suffer under the spells of dark sorcerers— spells like power, money, corruption, greed, envy, hatred, fear — they want us to believe their rule is eternal</h2>
<h2>we choose not reason nor faith, not intuition nor magic, not enlightenment nor epiphany.</h2>
<h2>there’s more than one way to brush a cat</h2>
<h2>cleaving the welkin</h2>
<ul>
<li>from the story of kamar al–zaman in the 1001 nights, translated by burton. a welkin is an english archaic term for the firmament, the heavens, the celestial sphere.</li>
</ul>
<h2>it may be hard to imagine that future ages will look upon ours with the horror that we see in the age of human sacrifice.</h2>
<h2>if you could travel back in time, would you try to stop the suffering that made you into the person you are today?</h2>
<h2>my mum is a witch and my dad was a vampire — who am I?</h2>
<ul>
<li>who the hell do I think I am?</li>
</ul>
<h2>it was just one of those things that change your entire world</h2>
<h2>mentor tires</h2>
<ul>
<li>let's write a story where the mentor is tired of trying with the million failures and is now just going through the motions. and of course the reader is the one who surprises him because is still reading.</li>
<li>if this so powerful why not hide it better? because it has to be within you first for it to work. the spell is self selecting.</li>
<li>not even a catalyst. just a small cleaning cloth for the lamp that holds the fire within.</li>
</ul>

<h2>show location of action by means of maps, not only one but several superimposed sequentially slightly differing and offset maybe also from different time periods. same too with actual satellite scenery, different seasons and different vegetations and landscapes all in various flashes before we zoom in to hero and journey.</h2>

<h2>Though I may not have much time left, and though we are far apart, I hope we will grower closer as friends. Friendship isn't magic, though it is magical.</h2>

<li>its all about the warning. if there are things you can't do because you are in the water, you need to get the warning to those on land so they can do those things, such as locate you both for rescue or take covers off covered exit pools so that you can both reach air and safety.</li>
