<p><em>small molecule modulation of splicing factor expression is associated with rescue from cellular senescence</em><br />
eva latorre et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12860-017-0147-7">dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12860-017-0147-7</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Altered expression of mRNA splicing factors occurs with ageing in vivo and is thought to be an ageing mechanism. The accumulation of senescent cells also occurs in vivo with advancing age and causes much degenerative age-related pathology. However, the relationship between these two processes is opaque. Accordingly we developed a novel panel of small molecules based on resveratrol, previously suggested to alter mRNA splicing, to determine whether altered splicing factor expression had potential to influence features of replicative senescence.<br />
Results<br />
Treatment with resveralogues was associated with altered splicing factor expression and rescue of multiple features of senescence. This rescue was independent of cell cycle traverse and also independent of SIRT1, SASP modulation or senolysis. Under growth permissive conditions, cells demonstrating restored splicing factor expression also demonstrated increased telomere length, re-entered cell cycle and resumed proliferation. These phenomena were also influenced by ERK antagonists and agonists.<br />
Conclusions<br />
This is the first demonstration that moderation of splicing factor levels is associated with reversal of cellular senescence in human primary fibroblasts. Small molecule modulators of such targets may therefore represent promising novel anti-degenerative therapies.</li>

<p><em>eradication of spontaneous malignancy by local immunotherapy</em><br />

<li>It has recently become apparent that the immune system can cure cancer. In some of these strategies, the antigen targets are preidentified and therapies are custom-made against these targets. In others, antibodies are used to remove the brakes of the immune system, allowing preexisting T cells to attack cancer cells. We have used another noncustomized approach called in situ vaccination. Immunoenhancing agents are injected locally into one site of tumor, thereby triggering a T cell immune response locally that then attacks cancer throughout the body. We have used a screening strategy in which the same syngeneic tumor is implanted at two separate sites in the body. One tumor is then injected with the test agents, and the resulting immune response is detected by the regression of the distant, untreated tumor. Using this assay, the combination of unmethylated CG–enriched oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG)—a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand—and anti-OX40 antibody provided the most impressive results. TLRs are components of the innate immune system that recognize molecular patterns on pathogens. Low doses of CpG injected into a tumor induce the expression of OX40 on CD4+ T cells in the microenvironment in mouse or human tumors. An agonistic anti-OX40 antibody can then trigger a T cell immune response, which is specific to the antigens of the injected tumor. Remarkably, this combination of a TLR ligand and an anti-OX40 antibody can cure multiple types of cancer and prevent spontaneous genetically driven cancers.</li>

<p><em>a single-dose plasmid-launched live-attenuated zika vaccine induces protective immunity</em><br />
jing zou et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.08.056">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.08.056</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines are the most effective means to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) usually have the advantages of single dose, rapid onset of immunity, and durable protection. DNA vaccines have the advantages of chemical stability, ease of production, and no cold chain requirement. The ability to combine the strengths of LAV and DNA vaccines may transform future vaccine development by eliminating cold chain and cell culture with the potential for adventitious agents.<br />
Methods<br />
A DNA-launched LAV was developed for ZIKV virus (ZIKV), a pathogen that recently caused a global public health emergency. The cDNA copy of a ZIKV LAV genome was engineered into a DNA plasmid. The DNA-LAV plasmid was delivered into mice using a clinically proven device TriGrid™ to launch the replication of LAV.<br />
Findings<br />
A single-dose immunization as low as 0.5 μg of DNA-LAV plasmid conferred 100% seroconversion in A129 mice. All seroconverted mice developed sterilizing immunity, as indicated by no detectable infectious viruses and no increase of neutralizing antibody titers after ZIKV challenge. The immunization also elicited robust T cell responses. In pregnant mice, the DNA-LAV vaccination fully protected against ZIKV-induced disease and maternal-to-fetal transmission. High levels of neutralizing activities were detected in fetal serum, indicating maternal-to-fetal humoral transfer. In male mice, a single-dose vaccination completely prevented testis infection, injury, and oligospermia.<br />
Interpretation<br />
The remarkable simplicity and potency of ZIKV DNA-LAV warrant further development of this vaccine candidate. The DNA-LAV approach may serve as a universal vaccine platform for other plus-sense RNA viruses.</li>

<p><em>membrane-less and non-evaporative desalination of hypersaline brines by temperature swing solvent extraction</em><br />
chanhee boo et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00182">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00182</a></p>

<p>&quot;temperature swing solvent extraction (TSSE)&quot; -- for hypersaline brines. The study, published online in Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters, demonstrates that TSSE can desalinate very high-salinity brines, up to seven times the concentration of seawater. This is a good deal more than reverse osmosis, the gold-standard for seawater desalination, and can hold handle approximately twice seawater salt concentrations.</p>
<p>VIDEO: https://youtu.be/P8VPVdZm0r8</p>
<p>Currently, hypersaline brines are desalinated either by membrane (reverse osmosis) or water evaporation (distillation). Each approach has limitations. Reverse osmosis methods are ineffective for high-saline brines because the pressures applied in reverse osmosis scale with the amount of salt: hypersaline brines require prohibitively high pressurizations. Distillation techniques, which evaporate the brine, are very energy-intensive.</p>
<p>Yip has been working on solvent extraction, a separation method widely employed for chemical engineering processes. The relatively inexpensive, simple, and effective separation technique is used in a wide range of industries, including production of fine organic compounds, purification of natural products, and extraction of valuable metal complexes.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought solvent extraction could be a good alternative desalination approach that is radically different from conventional methods because it is membrane-less and not based on evaporative phase-change,&quot; Yip says. &quot;Our results show that TSSE could be a disruptive technology -- it's effective, efficient, scalable, and can be sustainably powered.&quot;</p>
<p>TSSE utilizes a low-polarity solvent with temperature-dependent water solubility for the selective extraction of water over salt from saline feeds. Because it is membrane-less and not based on evaporation of water, it can sidestep the technical constraints that limit the more traditional methods. Importantly, TSSE is powered by low-grade heat (&lt; 70 C) that is inexpensive and sometimes even free. In the study, TSSE removed up to 98.4% of the salt, which is comparable to reverse osmosis, the gold standard for seawater desalination. The findings also demonstrated high water recovery &gt;50% for the hypersaline brines, also comparable to current seawater desalination operations. But, unlike TSSE, reverse osmosis cannot handle hypersaline brines.</p>
<p>&quot;We think TSSE will be transformational for the water industry,&quot; he adds. &quot;It can displace the prevailing practice of costly distillation for desalination of high-salinity brines and tackle higher salinities that RO cannot handle,&quot; Yip adds. &quot;This will radically improve the sustainability in the treatment of produced water, inland desalination concentrate, landfill leachate, and other hypersaline streams of emerging importance. We can eliminate the pollution problems from these brines and create cleaner, more useable water for our planet.&quot;</p>
<p>Yip's TSSE approach has a clear path to commercialization. The heat input can be sustainably supplied by low-grade thermal sources such as industrial waste heat, shallow-well geothermal, and low-concentration solar collectors. He is now working on further refining how TSSE works as a desalination method so that he can engineer further improvements in performance and test it with real-world samples in the field.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Hypersaline brines are of growing environmental importance but are technologically under-served by today’s desalination methods. Temperature swing solvent extraction (TSSE) is a radically different desalination technology that is membrane-less and not based on evaporative phase change. TSSE utilizes low-temperature heat and a low-polarity solvent with temperature-dependent water solubility for the selective extraction of water over salt from saline feeds. This study demonstrates TSSE desalination of high-salinity brines simulated by NaCl solutions with three amine solvents: diisopropylamine (DIPA), N-ethylcyclohexylamine (ECHA), and N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA). We show that TSSE can desalinate brines with salinities as high as ≈234000 ppm total dissolved solids (i.e., 4.0 M NaCl) and achieve salt removals up to 98.4%. Among the solvents, DIPA exhibited the highest water extraction efficiency whereas ECHA and DMCHA produced water with the lowest salt content and solvent residue content, respectively. Lastly, a high water recovery of &gt;50% was demonstrated for TSSE desalination of 1.5 M NaCl brine using DIPA in semibatch experiments with multiple extraction cycles. This study underscores the unique capabilities of TSSE for the desalination of hypersaline brines.</p>

<p><em>green synthesis of low-dimensional aluminum oxide hydroxide and oxide using liquid metal reaction media: ultrahigh flux membranes</em><br />
ali zavabeti et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>Liquid metal reaction media provides exciting new avenues for synthesizing low‐dimensional materials. Here, the synthesis of atomically thin sheets and nanofibers of boehmite (γ‐AlOOH) and their transformation into cubic alumina (γ‐Al2O3) via annealing is explored. The sheets are as thin as one orthorhombic boehmite unit cell. The addition of aluminum into a room temperature alloy of gallium, followed by exposing the melt to either liquid water or water vapor, allows growing either 2D sheets or 1D fibers, respectively. The isolated oxide hydroxides feature large surface areas, with the sheet morphologies also showing a high Young’s modulus. The method is green, since the liquid metal solvent can be fully reused. The ultrathin boehmite sheets are found suitable for the development of freestanding membrane filters that enable excellent separation of heavy metal ions and oil from aqueous solutions at extraordinary filtrate flux. The developed liquid metal‐based synthesis process offers a sustainable, green, and rapid method for synthesizing nanomorphologies of metal oxides which are challenging to obtain by conventional methods. The process is both sustainable and scalable and may be explored for the creation of other types of metal oxide compounds.</li>

<p><em>operation of passive membrane systems for drinking water treatment</em><br />
p.a. oka, n. khadem, p.r. bérubé 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>The widespread adoption of submerged hollow fibre ultrafiltration (UF) for drinking water treatment is currently hindered by the complexity and cost of these membrane systems, especially in small/remote communities. Most of the complexity is associated with auxiliary fouling control measures, which include backwashing, air sparging and chemical cleaning. Recent studies have demonstrated that sustained operation without fouling control measures is possible, but little is known regarding the conditions under which extended operation can be sustained with minimal to no fouling control measures. The present study investigated the contribution of different auxiliary fouling control measures to the permeability that can be sustained, with the intent of minimizing the mechanical and operational complexity of submerged hollow fiber UF membrane systems while maximizing their throughput capacity.<br />
Sustained conditions could be achieved without backwashing, air sparging or chemical cleaning (i.e. passive operation), indicating that these fouling control measures can be eliminated, substantially simplifying the mechanical and operational complexity of submerged hollow fiber UF systems. The adoption of hydrostatic pressure (i.e. gravity) to provide the driving force for permeation further reduced the system complexity. Approximately 50% of the organic material in the raw water was removed during treatment. The sustained passive operation and effective removal of organic material was likely due to the microbial community that established itself on the membrane surface. The permeability that could be sustained was however only approximately 20% of that which can be maintained with fouling control measures. Retaining a small amount of air sparging (i.e. a few minutes daily) and incorporating a daily 1-h relaxation (i.e. permeate flux interruption) period prior to sparging more than doubled the permeability that could be sustained. Neither the approach used to interrupt the permeate flux nor that developed to draw air into the system for sparging using gravity add substantial mechanical or operational complexity to the system. The high throughput capacity that can be sustained by eliminating all but a couple of simple fouling control measures make passive membrane systems ideally suited to provide high quality water especially where access to financial resources, technical expertise and/or electrical power is limited.</li>

<li>Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all fresh water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process for capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We report the design and demonstration of a device based on porous metal-organic framework-801 [Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6] that captures water from the atmosphere at ambient conditions using low-grade heat from natural sunlight below one sun (1 kW per square meter). This device is capable of harvesting 2.8 liters of water per kilogram of MOF daily at relative humidity levels as low as 20%, and requires no additional input of energy.</li>

<li>100% efficiency is the ultimate goal for all energy harvesting and conversion applications. However, no energy conversion process is reported to reach this ideal limit before. Here, an example with near perfect energy conversion efficiency in the process of solar vapor generation below room temperature is reported. Remarkably, when the operational temperature of the system is below that of the surroundings (i.e., under low density solar illumination), the total vapor generation rate is higher than the upper limit that can be produced by the input solar energy because of extra energy taken from the warmer environment. Experimental results are provided to validate this intriguing strategy under 1 sun illumination. The best measured rate is ≈2.20 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination, well beyond its corresponding upper limit of 1.68 kg m−2 h−1 and is even faster than the one reported by other systems under 2 sun illumination.</li>

<li>Separation of substances is central to many industrial and medical processes ranging from wastewater treatment and purification to medical diagnostics. Conventional solid-based membranes allow particles below a critical size to pass through a membrane pore while inhibiting the passage of particles larger than that critical size; membranes that are capable of showing reversed behavior, that is, the passage of large particles and inhibition of small ones, are unusual in conventional engineering applications. Inspired by endocytosis and the self-healing properties of liquids, we show that free-standing membranes composed entirely of liquid can be designed to retain particles smaller than a critical size given the particle inertial properties. We further demonstrate that these membranes can be used for previously unachievable applications, including serving as particle barriers that allow macroscopic device access through the membrane (for example, open surgery) or as selective membranes inhibiting gas/vapor passage while allowing solids to pass through them (for example, waste/odor management).</li>

<li>Multifunctional surfaces that are favorable for both droplet nucleation and removal are highly desirable for water harvesting applications but are rare. Inspired by the unique functions of pitcher plants and rice leaves, we present a hydrophilic directional slippery rough surface (SRS) that is capable of rapidly nucleating and removing water droplets. Our surfaces consist of nanotextured directional microgrooves in which the nanotextures alone are infused with hydrophilic liquid lubricant. We have shown through molecular dynamics simulations that the physical origin of the efficient droplet nucleation is attributed to the hydrophilic surface functional groups, whereas the rapid droplet removal is due to the significantly reduced droplet pinning of the directional surface structures and slippery interface. We have further demonstrated that the SRS, owing to its large surface area, hydrophilic slippery interface, and directional liquid repellency, outperforms conventional liquid-repellent surfaces in water harvesting applications.</li>

<ul>
<li>Current technologies for water purification are limited by their contaminant-specific removal capability, requiring multiple processes to meet water quality objectives. Here we show an innovative biomimetic micellar nanocoagulant that imitates the structure of Actinia, a marine predator that uses its tentacles to ensnare food, for the removal of an array of water contaminants with a single treatment step. The Actinia-like micellar nanocoagulant has a core–shell structure and readily disperses in water while maintaining a high stability against aggregation. To achieve effective coagulation, the nanocoagulant everts its configuration, similar to Actinia. The shell hydrolyses into ‘flocs’ and destabilizes and enmeshes colloidal particles while the core is exposed to water, like the extended tentacles of Actinia, and adsorbs the dissolved contaminants. The technology, with its ability to remove a broad spectrum of contaminants and produce high-quality water, has the potential to be a cost-effective replacement for current water treatment processes.</li>

<p>•10.6°C subambient cooling of water around noon under direct sunlight<br />
•Subambient cool-water production at various constant temperatures<br />
•The effect of weather conditions on the performance of radiative sky cooling<br />
•kW-scale radiative sky cooling system to demonstrate scalability of the technology</p>
<p>Radiative sky cooling dumps excessive heat to the low-temperature sky through infrared thermal radiation. Recent advances in materials have led to the breakthrough in daytime radiative cooling, with subambient temperatures achieved. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the cooling of water (with large thermal mass) to 10.6°C below ambient around noon under direct sunlight. The effects of different operating temperatures and weather conditions (local wind speed, precipitable water, and cloud cover) on the performance of radiative sky cooling have been investigated, which are essential for real-world applications. A kW-scale radiative sky cooling system with 13.5 m2 radiative surface area has been built to demonstrate scalability of the technology. As cooling demand increases dramatically in the 21st century, this work paves the way for promoting radiative sky cooling for energy saving, water saving, and more efficient power generation in the near future.</p>
<p>Real-world applications of radiative sky cooling require thoughtful design of the system, along with clear understanding of weather effects on system performance. This work explores application of radiative sky cooling based upon a low-cost radiative cooling metamaterial that can be scalably manufactured. A radiative cooled-cold collection (RadiCold) module is developed to cool water to 10.6°C below ambient at noon under stationary conditions. The effects of different weather conditions (wind speed, precipitable water, and cloud cover) on the performance of radiative cooling have been investigated. A kilowatt (kW)-scale RadiCold system with 13.5 m2 radiative cooling surface area is then built and demonstrated to provide a maximum cooling power of 1,296 W at night, and an average cooling power of 607 W at noon (12–2 p.m.) under 952 W/m2 average solar irradiance at 26.5 L/(h⋅m2) volumetric flow rate. A building-integrated RadiCold system is proposed to provide continuous day-and-night cooling.</p>

<p><em>contactless steam generation and superheating under one sun illumination</em><br />
thomas a. cooper et al. 2018<br />

<p>On a sunny day, the structure can passively pump out steam hot enough to sterilize medical equipment, as well as to use in cooking and cleaning. The steam may also supply heat to industrial processes, or it could be collected and condensed to produce desalinated, distilled drinking water.</p>
<p>The researchers previously developed a sponge-like structure that floated in a container of water and turned the water it absorbed into steam. But a big concern is that contaminants in the water caused the structure to degrade over time. The new device is designed to be suspended over the water, to avoid any possible contamination.</p>
<p>The suspended device is about the size and thickness of a small digital tablet or e-reader, and is structured like a sandwich: The top layer is made from a material that efficiently absorbs the sun's heat, while the bottom layer efficiently emits that heat to the water below. Once the water reaches the boiling point (100 C), it releases steam that rises back up into the device, where it is funneled through the middle layer -- a foam-like material that further heats the steam above the boiling point, before it's pumped out through a single tube.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a completely passive system -- you just leave it outside to absorb sunlight,&quot; says Thomas Cooper, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at York University, who led the work as a postdoc at MIT. &quot;You could scale this up to something that could be used in remote climates to generate enough drinking water for a family, or sterilize equipment for one operating room.&quot;</p>
<p>The team's results are detailed in a paper to be published in Nature Communications. The study includes researchers from the lab of Gang Chen, the Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering at MIT.</p>
<p>A clever combination</p>
<p>In 2014, Chen's group reported the first demonstration of a simple, solar-driven steam generator, in the form of a graphite-covered carbon foam that floats on water. This structure absorbs and localizes the sun's heat to the water's surface (the heat would otherwise penetrate down through the water). Since then, his group and others have looked to improve the efficiency of the design with materials of varying solar-absorbing properties. But almost every device has been designed to float directly on water, and they have all run into the problem of contamination, as their surfaces come into contact with salt and other impurities in water.</p>
<p>The team decided to design a device that instead is suspended above water. The device is structured to absorb short-wavelength solar energy, which in turn heats up the device, causing it to reradiate this heat, in the form of longer-wavelength infrared radiation, to the water below. Interestingly, the researchers note that infrared wavelengths are more readily absorbed by water, versus solar wavelengths, which would simply pass right through.</p>
<p>For the device's top layer, they chose a metal ceramic composite that is a highly efficient solar absorber. They coated the structure's bottom layer with a material that easily and efficiently emits infared heat. Between these two materials, they sandwiched a layer of reticulated carbon foam -- essentially, a sponge-like material studded with winding tunnels and pores, which retains the sun's incoming heat and can further heat up the steam rising back up through the foam. The researchers also attached a small outlet tube to one end of the foam, through which all the steam can exit and be easily collected.</p>
<p>Finally, they placed the device over a basin of water and surrounded the entire setup with a polymer enclosure to prevent heat from escaping.</p>
<p>&quot;It's this clever engineering of different materials and how they're arranged that allows us to achieve reasonably high efficiencies with this noncontact arrangement,&quot; Cooper says.</p>
<p>Full steam ahead</p>
<p>The researchers first tested the structure by running experiments in the lab, using a solar simulator that mimics the characteristics of natural sunlight at varying, controlled intensities. They found that the structure was able to heat a small basin of water to the boiling point and produce superheated steam, at 122 C, under conditions that simulated the sunlight produced on a clear, sunny day. When the researchers increased this solar intensity by 1.7 times, they found the device produced even hotter steam, at 144 C.</p>
<p>On Oct. 21, 2017, they tested the device on the roof of MIT's Building 1, under ambient conditions. The day was clear and bright, and to increase the sun's intensity further, the researchers constructed a simple solar concentrator -- a curved mirror that helps to collect and redirect more sunlight onto the device, thus raising the incoming solar flux, similar to the way a magnifying glass can be used to concentrate a sun's beam to heat up a patch of pavement.</p>
<p>With this added shielding, the structure produced steam in excess of 146 C over the course of 3.5 hours. In subsequent experiments, the team was able to produce steam from sea water, without contaminating the surface of the device with salt crystals. In another set of experiments, they were also able to collect and condense the steam in a flask to produce pure, distilled water.</p>
<p>Chen says that, in addition to overcoming the challenges of contamination, the device's design enables steam to be collected at a single point, in a concentrated stream, whereas previous designs produced more dilute spray.</p>
<p>&quot;This design really solves the fouling problem and the steam collection problem,&quot; Chen says. &quot;Now we're looking to make this more efficient and improve the system. There are different opportunities, and we're looking at what are the best options to pursue.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Steam generation using solar energy provides the basis for many sustainable desalination, sanitization, and process heating technologies. Recently, interest has arisen for low-cost floating structures that absorb solar radiation and transfer energy to water via thermal conduction, driving evaporation. However, contact between water and the structure leads to fouling and pins the vapour temperature near the boiling point. Here we demonstrate solar-driven evaporation using a structure not in contact with water. The structure absorbs solar radiation and re-radiates infrared photons, which are directly absorbed by the water within a sub-100 μm penetration depth. Due to the physical separation from the water, fouling is entirely avoided. Due to the thermal separation, the structure is no longer pinned at the boiling point, and is used to superheat the generated steam. We generate steam with temperatures up to 133 °C, demonstrating superheated steam in a non-pressurized system under one sun illumination.</p>

<p><em>designing bioinspired surfaces for water collection from fog</em><br />
dev gurera, bharat bhushan 2018<br />

<p>The cactus, beetle and desert grasses all collect water condensed from nighttime fog, gathering droplets from the air and filtering them to roots or reservoirs, providing enough hydration to survive.</p>
<p>Drops of water collect on wax-free, water-repellant bumps on a beetle's back, then slide toward the beetle's mouth on the flat surface between the bumps. Desert grasses collect water at their tips, then channel the water toward their root systems via channels in each blade. A cactus collects water on its barbed tips before guiding droplets down conical spines to the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Bhushan's team studied each of these living things and realized they could build a similar -- albeit larger -- system to allow humans to pull water from nighttime fog or condensation.</p>
<p>They started studying the ways by which different surfaces might collect water, and which surfaces might be the most efficient. Using 3D printers, they built surfaces with bumps and barbs, then created enclosed, foggy environments using a commercial humidifier to see which system gathered the most water.</p>
<p>They learned that conical shapes gather more water than do cylindrical shapes -- &quot;which made sense, given what we know about the cactus,&quot; Bhushan said. The reason that happens, he said, is because of a physics phenomenon called the Laplace pressure gradient. Water gathers at the tip of the cone, then flows down the cone's slope to the bottom, where a reservoir is waiting.</p>
<p>Grooved surfaces moved water more quickly than ungrooved surfaces -- &quot;which seems obvious in retrospect, because of what we know about grass,&quot; Bhushan said. In the research team's experiments, grooved surfaces gathered about twice as much water as ungrooved surfaces.</p>
<p>The materials the cones were made out of mattered, too. Hydrophilic surfaces -- those that allowed water to bead up rather than absorbing it -- gathered the most water.</p>
<p>&quot;The beetle's surface material is heterogeneous, with hydrophilic spots surrounded by hydrophobic regions, which allows water to flow more easily to the beetle's mouth,&quot; Bhushan explained.</p>
<p>The research team also experimented on a structure that included multiple cones, and learned that more water accumulated when water droplets could coalesce between cones that were one or two millimeters apart. The team is continuing those experiments, Bhushan said.</p>
<p>The work so far has been done on a laboratory-only level, but Bhushan envisions the work scaled up, with structures in the desert that could gather water from fog or condensation. That water, he thinks, could supplement water from public systems or wells, either on a house-by-house basis, or on a community-wide basis.</p>
<p>There is precedent for the idea: In areas around the world, including the Atacama Desert in Chile, large nets capture water from fog and collect it in reservoirs for farmers and others to use. Those nets might not be the most efficient way of harnessing water from the air, Bhushan believes.</p>
<p>&quot;Water supply is a critically important issue, especially for people of the most arid parts of the world,&quot; Bhushan said. &quot;By using bio-inspired technologies, we can help address the challenge of providing clean water to people around the globe, in as efficient a way as possible.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> A systematic study is presented on various water collectors, bioinspired by desert beetles, desert grass and cacti. Three water collecting mechanisms including heterogeneous wettability, grooved surfaces, and Laplace pressure gradient, were investigated on flat, cylindrical, conical surfaces, and conical array. It is found that higher water repellency in flat surfaces results in higher water collection rate and inclination angle (with respect to the vertical axis) has little effect. Surfaces with heterogeneous wettability have higher water collection rate than surfaces with homogeneous wettability. Both cylindrical and conical surfaces resulted in comparable water collection rate. However, only the cone transported the water droplets to its base. Heterogeneity, higher inclination and grooves increased the water collection rate. A cone has a higher collection rate per unit area than a flat surface with the same wettability. An array of cones has higher collection rate per unit area than a single cone, because droplets in a conical array coalesce, leading to higher frequency of droplets falling. Adding heterogeneity further increases the difference. Based on the findings, scaled-up designs of beetle-, grass- and cactus-inspired surfaces and nets are presented.</p>

<p><em>low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale de-icing</em><br />

<li>
<p>overcame a major limitation of previous ice-repellent coatings -- while they worked well on small areas, researchers found in field testing that they didn't shed ice on very large surfaces as effectively as they had hoped. That's an issue, since ice tends to cause the biggest problems on the biggest surfaces -- sapping efficiency, jeopardizing safety and necessitating costly removal.</p>
<p>They cleared this hurdle with a &quot;beautiful demonstration of mechanics.&quot; Anish Tuteja, an associate professor of materials science and engineering, described how he and his colleagues turned to a property that isn't well-known in icing research.</p>
<p>&quot;For decades, coating research has focused on lowering adhesion strength -- the force per unit area required to tear a sheet of ice from a surface,&quot; Tuteja said. &quot;The problem with this strategy is that the larger the sheet of ice, the more force is required. We found that we were bumping up against the limits of low adhesion strength, and our coatings became ineffective once the surface area got large enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The new coatings solve the problem by introducing a second strategy: low interfacial toughness, abbreviated LIT. Surfaces with low interfacial toughness encourage cracks to form between ice and the surface. And unlike breaking an ice sheet's surface adhesion, which requires tearing the entire sheet free, a crack only breaks the surface free along its leading edge. Once that crack starts, it can quickly spread across the entire iced surface, regardless of its size.</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine pulling a rug across a floor,&quot; said Michael Thouless, the Janine Johnson Weins Professor of Engineering in mechanical engineering. &quot;The larger the rug, the harder it is to move. You are resisted by the strength of the entire interface between the rug and floor. The frictional force is analogous to the interfacial strength.</p>
<p>&quot;But now imagine there's a wrinkle in that rug. It's easy to keep pushing that wrinkle across the rug, regardless of how big the rug is. The resistance to propagating the wrinkle is analogous to the interfacial toughness that resists the propagation of a crack.&quot;</p>
<p>Thouless said the concept of interfacial toughness is well known in the field of fracture mechanics, where it underpins products like laminated surfaces and adhesive-based aircraft joints. But until now, it hadn't been applied in ice mitigation. The advance came when Thouless learned of Tuteja's previous work and saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;Traditionally, fracture mechanics researchers only care about interfacial toughness, and ice mitigation researchers often only care about interfacial strength,&quot; Thouless said. &quot;But both parameters are important for understanding adhesion.</p>
<p>&quot;I pointed out to Anish that if he were to test increasing lengths of ice, he would find the failure load would rise while interfacial strength was important, but then plateau once toughness became important. Anish and his students tried the experiments and ended up with a really beautiful demonstration of the mechanics, and a new concept for ice adhesion.&quot;</p>
<p>To test the idea, Tuteja's team used a technique he honed during previous coating research. By mapping out the properties of a vast library of substances and adding interfacial toughness as well as adhesion strength to the equation, they were able to mathematically predict the properties of a coating without the need to physically test each one. This enabled them to concoct a wide variety of combinations, each with a specifically tailored balance between interfacial toughness and adhesion strength.</p>
<p>They tested a variety of coatings on large surfaces -- a rigid aluminum sheet approximately 3 feet square, and a flexible aluminum piece approximately 1 inch wide and 3 feet long, to mimic a power line. On every surface, ice fell off immediately due to its own weight. It stuck fast, however, to the control surfaces, which were identical in size -- one was uncoated and another was coated with an earlier icephobic coating.</p>
<p>The team's next step is to improve its durability of the LIT coatings.</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite exceptional recent advances in tailoring the wettability of surfaces, to date, no engineered surface can passively suppress the in-plane growth of frost that invariably occurs in humid, subfreezing environments. Here, we show that up to 90% of a surface can exhibit passive antifrosting by using chemical or physical wettability patterns to template “ice stripes” across the surface. As ice exhibits a depressed vapor pressure relative to liquid water, these sacrificial ice stripes siphon the supersaturated water vapor to keep the intermediate surface areas dry from dew and frost. Further, we show that when these sacrificial ice stripes are elevated atop microfins, they diffusively coarsen in a suspended state above the surface. The suspended state of the coarsening ice results in a diffusive growth rate an order of magnitude slower than frost coarsening directly on a solid substrate and should also minimize its adhesive strength to the surface.</li>

<p><em>colossal barocaloric effects near room temperature in plastic crystals of neopentylglycol</em><br />

<p>When put under pressure, plastic crystals of neopentylglycol yield huge cooling effects -- enough that they are competitive with conventional coolants. In addition, the material is inexpensive, widely available and functions at close to room temperature. Details are published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
<p>The gases currently used in the vast majority of refrigerators and air conditioners -- hydrofluorocarbons and hydrocarbons (HFCs and HCs) -- are toxic and flammable. When they leak into the air, they also contribute to global warming.</p>
<p>&quot;Refrigerators and air conditioners based on HFCs and HCs are also relatively inefficient,&quot; said Dr Xavier Moya, from the University of Cambridge, who led the research with Professor Josep Lluís Tamarit, from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. &quot;That's important because refrigeration and air conditioning currently devour a fifth of the energy produced worldwide, and demand for cooling is only going up.&quot;</p>
<p>To solve these problems, materials scientists around the world have sought alternative solid refrigerants. Moya, a Royal Society Research Fellow in Cambridge's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, is one of the leaders in this field.</p>
<p>In their newly published research, Moya and collaborators from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and the Universitat de Barcelona describe the enormous thermal changes under pressure achieved with plastic crystals.</p>
<p>Conventional cooling technologies rely on the thermal changes that occur when a compressed fluid expands. Most cooling devices work by compressing and expanding fluids such as HFCs and HCs. As the fluid expands, it decreases in temperature, cooling its surroundings.</p>
<p>With solids, cooling is achieved by changing the material's microscopic structure. This change can be achieved by applying a magnetic field, an electric field or through mechanic force. For decades, these caloric effects have fallen behind the thermal changes available in fluids, but the discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in a plastic crystal of neopentylglycol (NPG) and other related organic compounds has levelled the playfield.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of their chemical bonds, organic materials are easier to compress, and NPG is widely used in the synthesis of paints, polyesters, plasticisers and lubricants. It's not only widely available but also is inexpensive.</p>
<p>NPG's molecules, composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, are nearly spherical and interact with each other only weakly. These loose bonds in its microscopic structure permit the molecules to rotate relatively freely.</p>
<p>The word &quot;plastic&quot; in &quot;plastic crystals&quot; refers not to its chemical composition but rather to its malleability. Plastic crystals lie at the boundary between solids and liquids.</p>
<p>Compressing NPG yields unprecedentedly large thermal changes due to molecular reconfiguration. The temperature change achieved is comparable with those exploited commercially in HFCs and HCs.</p>
<p>The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in a plastic crystal should bring barocaloric materials to the forefront of research and development to achieve safe environmentally friendly cooling without compromising performance.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> There is currently great interest in replacing the harmful volatile hydrofluorocarbon fluids used in refrigeration and air-conditioning with solid materials that display magnetocaloric, electrocaloric or mechanocaloric effects. However, the field-driven thermal changes in all of these caloric materials fall short with respect to their fluid counterparts. Here we show that plastic crystals of neopentylglycol (CH3)2C(CH2OH)2 display extremely large pressure-driven thermal changes near room temperature due to molecular reconfiguration, that these changes outperform those observed in any type of caloric material, and that these changes are comparable with those exploited commercially in hydrofluorocarbons. Our discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in a plastic crystal should bring barocaloric materials to the forefront of research and development in order to achieve safe environmentally friendly cooling without compromising performance.</p>

<p>making stem cells from normal adult human blood<br />
<em>identification of embryonic neural plate border stem cells and their generation by direct reprogramming from adult human blood cells</em><br />
marc christian thier et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2018.11.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2018.11.015</a></p>

<p>Stem cells are considered to be the all-rounders of our tissues: they can multiply indefinitely and then -- if they are pluripotent embryonic stem cells -- generate all conceivable cell types. In 2006, the Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka recognized that such cells could also be produced in the laboratory -- from mature body cells. Four genetic factors alone are sufficient to reverse the course of development and produce so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) that have identical properties to embryonic stem cells. Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2012 for this discovery.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a major breakthrough for stem cell research,&quot; said Andreas Trumpp, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Director of HI-STEM in Heidelberg. &quot;This applies in particular to for research in Germany, where the generation of human embryonic stem cells is not permitted. Stem cells have enormous potential both for basic research and for the development of regenerative therapies that aim to restore diseased tissue in patients. However, reprogramming is also associated with problems: For example, pluripotent cells can form germ line tumors, so-called teratomas.</p>
<p>Another possibility is not to completely turn back the course of development. For the first time, Trumpp's team has succeeded in reprogramming mature human cells in such a way that a defined type of induced neural stem cells is produced that can multiply almost indefinitely. &quot;We used four genetic factors like Yamanaka, but different ones for our reprogramming,&quot; explains Marc Christian Thier, first author of the study. &quot;We assumed that our factors would allow reprogramming to an early stage of development of the nervous system.&quot;</p>
<p>In the past, other research groups also reprogrammed connective tissue cells into mature nerve cells or neural precursor cells. However, these artificially produced nerve cells often could not be expanded and could therefore hardly be used for therapeutic purposes. &quot;Often, it was a heterogeneous mixture of different cell types that might not exist in the body under physiological conditions,&quot; said Andreas Trumpp explaining the problems.</p>
<p>Together with stem cell researcher Frank Edenhofer from the University of Innsbruck and neuroscientist Hannah Monyer from DKFZ and the Heidelberg University Hospital, Trumpp and his team have succeeded in reprogramming different human cells: connective tissue cells of the skin or pancreas as well as peripheral blood cells. &quot;The origin of the cells had no influence on the properties of the stem cells,&quot; said Thier. In particular, the possibility of extracting neural stem cells from the blood of patients without invasive intervention is a decisive advantage for future therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>What is special about the reprogrammed cells of the Heidelberg researchers is that they are a homogeneous cell type that resembles a stage of neural stem cells that occurs during the embryonic development of the nervous system. &quot;Corresponding cells exist in mice and probably also in humans during early embryonic brain development,&quot; said Thier. &quot;We have described here a new neural stem cell type in the mammalian embryo.</p>
<p>These so called &quot;induced Neural Plate Border Stem Cells&quot; (iNBSCs) have a broad development potential. The iNBSCs of the Heidelberg scientists are expandable and multipotent and can develop in two different directions. On the one hand, they can take the path of development to mature nerve cells and their supplier cells, the glial cells, i.e. become cells of the central nervous system. On the other hand, they can also develop into cells of the neural crest, from which different cell types emerge, for example peripheral sensitive nerve cells or cartilage and bones of the skull.</p>
<p>The iNBSCs thus form an ideal basis for generating a broad range of different cell types for an individual patient. &quot;These cells have the same genetic material as the donor and are therefore presumably recognized as &quot;self&quot; by the immune system and are not rejected,&quot; explains Thier.</p>
<p>The CRISPR/Cas9 gene scissors can be used to modify the iNBSC or repair genetic defects, as the scientists have shown in their experiments. &quot;They are therefore of interesting both for basic research and the search for new active substances and for the development of regenerative therapies, for example in patients with diseases of the nervous system. However until we can use them in patients, a lot of research work will still be necessary,&quot; emphasizes Trumpp</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •Four factors directly reprogram human somatic cells into self-renewing iNBSCs<br />
•Multipotent iNBSCs can generate CNS and neural crest progeny<br />
•NBSCs can also be obtained by iPSC differentiation or from E8.5 mouse neural folds<br />
•Expandable iNBSCs can be easily modified via CRISPR/Cas9 to model neural diseases</p>
<p>We report the direct reprogramming of both adult human fibroblasts and blood cells into induced neural plate border stem cells (iNBSCs) by ectopic expression of four neural transcription factors. Self-renewing, clonal iNBSCs can be robustly expanded in defined media while retaining multilineage differentiation potential. They generate functional cell types of neural crest and CNS lineages and could be used to model a human pain syndrome via gene editing of SCN9A in iNBSCs. NBSCs can also be derived from human pluripotent stem cells and share functional and molecular features with NBSCs isolated from embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) mouse neural folds. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified the anterior hindbrain as the origin of mouse NBSCs, with human iNBSCs sharing a similar regional identity. In summary, we identify embryonic NBSCs and report their generation by direct reprogramming in human, which may facilitate insights into neural development and provide a neural stem cell source for applications in regenerative medicine.</p>

<p><em>annexin-enriched osteoblast-derived vesicles act as an extracellular site of mineral nucleation within developing stem cell cultures</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The application of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as natural delivery vehicles capable of enhancing tissue regeneration could represent an exciting new phase in medicine. We sought to define the capacity of EVs derived from mineralising osteoblasts (MO-EVs) to induce mineralisation in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) cultures and delineate the underlying biochemical mechanisms involved. Strikingly, we show that the addition of MO-EVs to MSC cultures significantly (P &lt; 0.05) enhanced the expression of alkaline phosphatase, as well as the rate and volume of mineralisation beyond the current gold-standard, BMP-2. Intriguingly, these effects were only observed in the presence of an exogenous phosphate source. EVs derived from non-mineralising osteoblasts (NMO-EVs) were not found to enhance mineralisation beyond the control. Comparative label-free LC-MS/MS profiling of EVs indicated that enhanced mineralisation could be attributed to the delivery of bridging collagens, primarily associated with osteoblast communication, and other non-collagenous proteins to the developing extracellular matrix. In particular, EV-associated annexin calcium channelling proteins, which form a nucleational core with the phospholipid-rich membrane and support the formation of a pre-apatitic mineral phase, which was identified using infrared spectroscopy. These findings support the role of EVs as early sites of mineral nucleation and demonstrate their value for promoting hard tissue regeneration.</li>

<li>Clonal microbial populations often harbor rare phenotypic variants that are typically hidden within the majority of the remaining cells, but are crucial for the population’s resilience to external perturbations. Persister and viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells are two important clonal bacterial subpopulations that can survive antibiotic treatment. Both persister and VBNC cells pose a serious threat to human health. However, unlike persister cells, which quickly resume growth following drug removal, VBNC cells can remain non-growing for prolonged periods of time, thus eluding detection via traditional microbiological assays. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of VBNC cells requires the characterization of the clonal population with single-cell resolution. A combination of microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and fluorescent reporter strains offers the perfect platform for investigating individual cells while manipulating their environment.</li>

<ul>
<li>True physiological imaging of subcellular dynamics requires studying cells within their parent organisms, where all the environmental cues that drive gene expression, and hence the phenotypes that we actually observe, are present. A complete understanding also requires volumetric imaging of the cell and its surroundings at high spatiotemporal resolution, without inducing undue stress on either. We combined lattice light-sheet microscopy with adaptive optics to achieve, across large multicellular volumes, noninvasive aberration-free imaging of subcellular processes, including endocytosis, organelle remodeling during mitosis, and the migration of axons, immune cells, and metastatic cancer cells in vivo. The technology reveals the phenotypic diversity within cells across different organisms and developmental stages and may offer insights into how cells harness their intrinsic variability to adapt to different physiological environments.</li>

<p><em>yet another text captcha solver: a generative adversarial network based approach</em><br />
guixin ye et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243754">http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243754</a></p>

<p>The new algorithm, based on deep learning methods, is the most effective solver of captcha security and authentication systems to date and is able to defeat versions of text captcha schemes used to defend the majority of the world's most popular websites.</p>
<p>Text-based captchas use a jumble of letters and numbers, along with other security features such as occluding lines, to distinguish between humans and malicious automated computer programmes. It relies on people finding it easier to decipher the characters than machines.</p>
<p>Developed by computer scientists at Lancaster University in the UK as well as Northwest University and Peking University in China, the solver delivers significantly higher accuracy than previous captcha attack systems, and is able to successfully crack versions of captcha where previous attack systems have failed.</p>
<p>The solver is also highly efficient. It can solve a captcha within 0.05 of a second by using a desktop PC.</p>
<p>It works by using a technique known as a 'Generative Adversarial Network', or GAN. This involves teaching a captcha generator programme to produce large numbers of training captchas that are indistinguishable from genuine captchas. These are then used to rapidly train a solver, which is then refined and tested against real captchas.</p>
<p>By using a machine-learned automatic captcha generator the researchers, or would be attackers, are able to significantly reduce the effort, and time, needed to find and manually tag captchas to train their software. It only requires 500 genuine captchas, instead of the millions that would normally be needed to effectively train an attack programme.</p>
<p>Previous captcha solvers are specific to one particular captcha variation. Prior machine-learning attack systems are labour intensive to build, requiring a lot of manual tagging of captchas to train the systems. They are also easily rendered obsolete by small changes in the security features used within captchas.</p>
<p>Because the new solver requires little human involvement it can easily be rebuilt to target new, or modified, captcha schemes.</p>
<p>The programme was tested on 33 captcha schemes, of which 11 are used by many of the world's most popular websites -- including eBay, Wikipedia and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Dr Zheng Wang, Senior Lecturer at Lancaster University's School of Computing and Communications and co-author of the research, said: &quot;This is the first time a GAN-based approach has been used to construct solvers. Our work shows that the security features employed by the current text-based captcha schemes are particularly vulnerable under deep learning methods.</p>
<p>&quot;We show for the first time that an adversary can quickly launch an attack on a new text-based captcha scheme with very low effort. This is scary because it means that this first security defence of many websites is no longer reliable. This means captcha opens up a huge security vulnerability which can be exploited by an attack in many ways.</p>
<p>Mr Guixin Ye, the lead student author of the work said: &quot;It allows an adversary to launch an attack on services, such as Denial of Service attacks or spending spam or fishing messages, to steal personal data or even forge user identities. Given the high success rate of our approach for most of the text captcha schemes, websites should be abandoning captchas.&quot;</p>
<p>Researchers believe websites should be considering alternative measures that use multiple layers of security, such as a user's use patterns, the device location or even biometric information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Despite several attacks have been proposed, text-based CAPTCHAs are still being widely used as a security mechanism. One of the reasons for the pervasive use of text captchas is that many of the prior attacks are scheme-specific and require a labor-intensive and time-consuming process to construct. This means that a change in the captcha security features like a noisier background can simply invalid an earlier attack. This paper presents a generic, yet effective text captcha solver based on the generative adversarial network. Unlike prior machine-learning-based approaches that need a large volume of manually-labeled real captchas to learn an effective solver, our approach requires significantly fewer real captchas but yields much better performance. This is achieved by first learning a captcha synthesizer to automatically generate synthetic captchas to learn a base solver, and then fine-tuning the base solver on a small set of real captchas using transfer learning. We evaluate our approach by applying it to 33 captcha schemes, including 11 schemes that are currently being used by 32 of the top-50 popular websites including Microsoft, Wikipedia, eBay and Google. Our approach is the most capable attack on text captchas seen to date. It outperforms four state-of-the-art text-captcha solvers by not only delivering a significant higher accuracy on all testing schemes, but also successfully attacking schemes where others have zero chance. We show that our approach is highly efficient as it can solve a captcha within 0.05 second using a desktop GPU. We demonstrate that our attack is generally applicable because it can bypass the advanced security features employed by most modern text captcha schemes. We hope the results of our work can encourage the community to revisit the design and practical use of text captchas.</p>

<p><em>nilm dashboard: a power system monitor for electromechanical equipment diagnostics</em><br />
andre aboulian et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tii.2018.2843770">http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tii.2018.2843770</a></p>

<p>a sensor that simply is attached to the outside of an electrical wire at a single point, without requiring any cutting or splicing of wires. From that single point, it can sense the flow of current in the adjacent wire, and detect the distinctive &quot;signatures&quot; of each motor, pump, or piece of equipment in the circuit by analyzing tiny, unique fluctuations in the voltage and current whenever a device switches on or off. The system can also be used to monitor energy usage, to identify possible efficiency improvements and determine when and where devices are in use or sitting idle.</p>
<p>The technology is especially well-suited for relatively small, contained electrical systems such as those serving a small ship, building, or factory with a limited number of devices to monitor. In a series of tests on a Coast Guard cutter based in Boston, the system provided a dramatic demonstration last year.</p>
<p>About 20 different motors and devices were being tracked by a single dashboard, connected to two different sensors, on the cutter USCGC Spencer. The sensors, which in this case had a hard-wired connection, showed that an anomalous amount of power was being drawn by a component of the ship's main diesel engines called a jacket water heater. At that point, Leeb says, crewmembers were skeptical about the reading but went to check it anyway. The heaters are hidden under protective metal covers, but as soon as the cover was removed from the suspect device, smoke came pouring out, and severe corrosion and broken insulation were clearly revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;The ship is complicated,&quot; Leeb says. &quot;It's magnificently run and maintained, but nobody is going to be able to spot everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Nicholas Galanti, engineer officer on the cutter, says &quot;the advance warning from NILM enabled Spencer to procure and replace these heaters during our in-port maintenance period, and deploy with a fully mission-capable jacket water system. Furthermore, NILM detected a serious shock hazard and may have prevented a class Charlie [electrical] fire in our engine room.&quot;</p>
<p>The system is designed to be easy to use with little training. The computer dashboard features dials for each device being monitored, with needles that will stay in the green zone when things are normal, but swing into the yellow or red zone when a problem is spotted.</p>
<p>Detecting anomalies before they become serious hazards is the dashboard's primary task, but Leeb points out that it can also perform other useful functions. By constantly monitoring which devices are being used at what times, it could enable energy audits to find devices that were turned on unnecessarily when nobody was using them, or spot less-efficient motors that are drawing more current than their similar counterparts. It could also help ensure that proper maintenance and inspection procedures are being followed, by showing whether or not a device has been activated as scheduled for a given test.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a three-legged stool,&quot; Leeb says. The system allows for &quot;energy scorekeeping, activity tracking, and condition-based monitoring.&quot; But it's that last capability that could be crucial, &quot;especially for people with mission-critical systems,&quot; he says. In addition to the Coast Guard and the Navy, he says, that includes companies such as oil producers or chemical manufacturers, who need to monitor factories and field sites that include flammable and hazardous materials and thus require wide safety margins in their operation.</p>
<p>One important characteristic of the system that is attractive for both military and industrial applications, Leeb says, is that all of its computation and analysis can be done locally, within the system itself, and does not require an internet connection at all, so the system can be physically and electronically isolated and thus highly resistant to any outside tampering or data theft.</p>
<p>Although for testing purposes the team has installed both hard-wired and noncontact versions of the monitoring system -- both types were installed in different parts of the Coast Guard cutter -- the tests have shown that the noncontact version could likely produce sufficient information, making the installation process much simpler. While the anomaly they found on that cutter came from the wired version, Leeb says, &quot;if the noncontact version was installed&quot; in that part of the ship, &quot;we would see almost the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) uses electrical measurements taken at a centralized point in a network to monitor many loads downstream. This paper introduces NILM dashboard, a machine intelligence, and graphical platform that uses NILM data for real-time electromechanical system diagnostics. The operation of individual loads is disaggregated using signal processing and presented as time-based load activity and statistical indicators. The software allows multiple NILM devices to be networked together to provide information about loads residing on different electrical branches at the same time. A graphical user interface provides analysis tools for energy scorekeeping, detecting fault conditions, and determining operating state. The NILM dashboard is demonstrated on the power system data from two United States Coast Guard cutters.</p>

<p>combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (ML-DSP), could for the first time make it possible to definitively answer questions such as how many different species exist on Earth and in the oceans. How are existing, newly-discovered, and extinct species related to each other? What are the bacterial origins of human mitochondrial DNA? Do the DNA of a parasite and its host have a similar genomic signature?</p>
<p>The tool also has the potential to positively impact the personalized medicine industry by identifying the specific strain of a virus and thus allowing for precise drugs to be developed and prescribed to treat it.</p>
<p>ML-DSP is an alignment-free software tool which works by transforming a DNA sequence into a digital (numerical) signal, and uses digital signal processing methods to process and distinguish these signals from each other.</p>
<p>&quot;With this method even if we only have small fragments of DNA we can still classify DNA sequences, regardless of their origin, or whether they are natural, synthetic, or computer-generated,&quot; said Lila Kari, a professor in Waterloo's Faculty of Mathematics. &quot;Another important potential application of this tool is in the healthcare sector, as in this era of personalized medicine we can classify viruses and customize the treatment of a particular patient depending on the specific strain of the virus that affects them.&quot;</p>
<p>In the study, researchers performed a quantitative comparison with other state-of-the-art classification software tools on two small benchmark datasets and one large 4,322 vertebrate mitochondrial genome dataset. &quot;Our results show that ML-DSP overwhelmingly outperforms alignment-based software in terms of processing time, while having classification accuracies that are comparable in the case of small datasets and superior in the case of large datasets,&quot; Kari said. &quot;Compared with other alignment-free software, ML-DSP has significantly better classification accuracy and is overall faster.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors also conducted preliminary experiments indicating the potential of ML-DSP to be used for other datasets, by classifying 4,271 complete dengue virus genomes into subtypes with 100 per cent accuracy, and 4,710 bacterial genomes into divisions with 95.5 per cent accuracy.</p>

<p><em>detecting middle ear fluid using smartphones</em><br />

<p>Ear infections are the most common reason that parents bring their children to a pediatrician, according to the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>This condition occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear behind the eardrum and is infected. This buildup is also common in another condition called otitis media with effusion. Any kind of fluid buildup can be painful and make it hard for children to hear, which can be especially detrimental when they are learning to talk.</p>
<p>Both conditions are hard to diagnose because they have vague symptoms: Sometimes children tug on their ears or have fevers, and sometimes there are no symptoms. In addition, young children may not be able to describe where they hurt.</p>
<p>Now researchers at the University of Washington have created a new smartphone app that can detect fluid behind the eardrum by simply using a piece of paper and a smartphone's microphone and speaker. The smartphone makes a series of soft audible chirps into the ear through a small paper funnel and, depending on the way the chirps are reflected back to the phone, the app determines the likelihood of fluid present with a probability of detection of 85%. This is on par with current methods used by specialists to detect fluid in the middle ear, which involve specialized tools that use acoustics or a puff of air.</p>
<p>The team published its results May 15 in Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Designing an accurate screening tool on something as ubiquitous as a smartphone can be game changing for parents as well as health care providers in resource limited regions,&quot; said co-author Shyam Gollakota, an associate professor in the UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. &quot;A key advantage of our technology is that it does not require any additional hardware other than a piece of paper and a software app running on the smartphone.&quot;</p>
<p>Once diagnosed, ear infections can be easily treated with observation or antibiotics, and persistent fluid can be monitored or drained by a doctor to relieve symptoms of pain or hearing loss. A quick screening at home could help parents decide whether or not they need to take their child to the doctor.</p>
<p>This app works by sending sounds into the ear and measuring how those sound waves change as they bounce off the eardrum. The team's system involves a smartphone and a regular piece of paper that the doctor or parent can cut and fold into a funnel. The funnel rests on the outer ear and guides sound waves in and out of the ear canal. When the phone plays a continuous 150 millisecond sound -- which sounds like a bird chirping -- through the funnel, the sound waves bounce off the eardrum, travel back through the funnel and are picked up by the smartphone's microphone along with the original chirps. Depending on whether there's fluid inside, the reflected sound waves interfere with the original chirp sound waves differently.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like tapping a wine glass,&quot; said co-first author Justin Chan, a doctoral student in the Allen School. &quot;Depending on how much liquid is in it, you get different sounds. Using machine learning on these sounds, we can detect the presence of liquid.&quot;</p>
<p>When there is no fluid behind the eardrum, the eardrum vibrates and sends a variety of sound waves back. These sound waves mildly interfere with the original chirp, creating a broad, shallow dip in the overall signal. But when the eardrum has fluid behind it, it doesn't vibrate as well and reflects the original sound waves back. They interfere more strongly with the original chirp and create a narrow, deep dip in the signal.</p>
<p>To train an algorithm that detects changes in the signal and classifies ears as having fluid or not, the team tested 53 children between the ages of 18 months and 17 years at Seattle Children's Hospital. About half of the children were scheduled to undergo surgery for ear tube placement, a common surgery for patients with chronic or recurrent incidents of ear fluid. The other half were scheduled to undergo a different surgery unrelated to ears, such as a tonsillectomy.</p>
<p>&quot;What is really unique about this study is that we used the gold standard for diagnosing ear infections,&quot; said co-first author Dr. Sharat Raju, a surgical resident in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the UW School of Medicine. &quot;When we put in ear tubes, we make an incision into the eardrum and drain any fluid present. That's the best way to tell if there is fluid behind the eardrum. So these surgeries created the ideal setting for this study.&quot;</p>
<p>After parents provided informed consent, the team recorded the chirps and their resulting sound waves from the patients' ears immediately before surgery. Many of the children responded to the chirps by smiling or laughing.</p>
<p>Among the children getting their ear tubes placed, surgery revealed that 24 ears had fluid behind the eardrum, while 24 ears did not. For children scheduled for other surgeries, two ears had bulging eardrums characteristic of an ear infection, while the other 48 ears were fine. The algorithm correctly identified the likelihood of fluid 85% of the time, which is comparable to current methods that specialized doctors use to diagnose fluid in the inner ear.</p>
<p>Then the team tested the algorithm on 15 ears belonging to younger children between nine and 18 months of age. It correctly classified all five ears that were positive for fluid and nine out of the 10 ears, or 90%, that did not have fluid.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though our algorithm was trained on older kids, it still works well for this age group,&quot; said co-author Dr. Randall Bly, an assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the UW School of Medicine who practices at Seattle Children's Hospital. &quot;This is critical because this group has a high incidence of ear infections.&quot;</p>
<p>Because the researchers want parents to be able to use this technology at home, the team trained parents how to use the system on their own children. Parents and doctors folded paper funnels, tested 25 ears and compared the results. Both parents and doctors successfully detected the six fluid-filled ears. Parents and doctors also agreed on 18 out of the 19 ears with no fluid. In addition, the sound wave curves generated by both parent and doctor tests looked similar.</p>
<p>&quot;The ability to know how often and for how long fluid has been present could help us make the best management decisions with patients and parents,&quot; Bly said. &quot;It also could help primary care providers know when to refer to a specialist.&quot;</p>
<p>The team also tested the algorithm on a variety of smartphones and used different types of paper to make the funnel. The results were consistent regardless of phone or paper type. The researchers plan on commercializing this technology through a spinout company, Edus Health, and then making the app available to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;Fluid behind the eardrum is so common in children that there's a direct need for an accessible and accurate screening tool that can be used at home or clinical settings,&quot; Raju said. &quot;If parents could use a piece of hardware they already have to do a quick physical exam that can say 'Your child most likely doesn't have ear fluid' or 'Your child likely has ear fluid, you should make an appointment with your pediatrician,' that would be huge.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The presence of middle ear fluid is a key diagnostic marker for two of the most common pediatric ear diseases: acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. We present an accessible solution that uses speakers and microphones within existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. We conducted a clinical study on 98 patient ears at a pediatric surgical center. Using leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate performance on unseen data, we obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.898 for the smartphone-based machine learning algorithm. In comparison, commercial acoustic reflectometry, which requires custom hardware, achieved an AUC of 0.776. Furthermore, we achieved 85% sensitivity and 82% specificity, comparable to published performance measures for tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy. Similar results were obtained when testing across multiple smartphone platforms. Parents of pediatric patients (n = 25 ears) demonstrated similar performance to trained clinicians when using the smartphone-based system. These results demonstrate the potential for a smartphone to be a low-barrier and effective screening tool for detecting the presence of middle ear fluid.</p>

<ul>
<li>The devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caught millions of coastal residents and the scientific community off-guard. Subsequent research in the Indian Ocean basin has identified prehistoric tsunamis, but the timing and recurrence intervals of such events are uncertain. Here we present an extraordinary 7,400 year stratigraphic sequence of prehistoric tsunami deposits from a coastal cave in Aceh, Indonesia. This record demonstrates that at least 11 prehistoric tsunamis struck the Aceh coast between 7,400 and 2,900 years ago. The average time period between tsunamis is about 450 years with intervals ranging from a long, dormant period of over 2,000 years, to multiple tsunamis within the span of a century. Although there is evidence that the likelihood of another tsunamigenic earthquake in Aceh province is high, these variable recurrence intervals suggest that long dormant periods may follow Sunda megathrust ruptures as large as that of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.</li>

<p><em>processing bulk natural wood into a high-performance structural material</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Synthetic structural materials with exceptional mechanical performance suffer from either large weight and adverse environmental impact (for example, steels and alloys) or complex manufacturing processes and thus high cost (for example, polymer-based and biomimetic composites). Natural wood is a low-cost and abundant material and has been used for millennia as a structural material for building and furniture construction9. However, the mechanical performance of natural wood (its strength and toughness) is unsatisfactory for many advanced engineering structures and applications. Pre-treatment with steam, heat, ammonia or cold rolling followed by densification has led to the enhanced mechanical performance of natural wood. However, the existing methods result in incomplete densification and lack dimensional stability, particularly in response to humid environments, and wood treated in these ways can expand and weaken. Here we report a simple and effective strategy to transform bulk natural wood directly into a high-performance structural material with a more than tenfold increase in strength, toughness and ballistic resistance and with greater dimensional stability. Our two-step process involves the partial removal of lignin and hemicellulose from the natural wood via a boiling process in an aqueous mixture of NaOH and Na2SO3 followed by hot-pressing, leading to the total collapse of cell walls and the complete densification of the natural wood with highly aligned cellulose nanofibres. This strategy is shown to be universally effective for various species of wood. Our processed wood has a specific strength higher than that of most structural metals and alloys, making it a low-cost, high-performance, lightweight alternative.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most optoelectronic components and consumer display devices require glass or plastic covers for protection against the environment. Optical reflections from these encapsulation layers can degrade the device performance or lessen the user experience. Here, we use a highly scalable self-assembly based approach to texture glass surfaces at the nanoscale, reducing reflections by such an extent so as to make the glass essentially invisible. Our nanotextures provide broadband antireflection spanning visible and infrared wavelengths (450–2500 nm) that is effective even at large angles of incidence. This technology can be used to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices by eliminating reflection losses, which can be as much as 8% for glass encapsulated cells. In contrast, solar cells encapsulated with nanotextured glass generate the same photocurrent as when operated without a cover. Ultra-transparent windows having surface nanotextures on both sides can withstand three times more optical fluence than commercial broadband antireflection coatings, making them useful for pulsed laser applications.</li>

<ul>
<li>Recent work suggests that thermally stable nanocrystallinity in metals is achievable in several binary alloys by modifying grain boundary energies via solute segregation. The remarkable thermal stability of these alloys has been demonstrated in recent reports, with many alloys exhibiting negligible grain growth during prolonged exposure to near‐melting temperatures. Pt–Au, a proposed stable alloy consisting of two noble metals, is shown to exhibit extraordinary resistance to wear. Ultralow wear rates, less than a monolayer of material removed per sliding pass, are measured for Pt–Au thin films at a maximum Hertz contact stress of up to 1.1 GPa. This is the first instance of an all‐metallic material exhibiting a specific wear rate on the order of 10−9 mm3 N−1 m−1, comparable to diamond‐like carbon (DLC) and sapphire. Remarkably, the wear rate of sapphire and silicon nitride probes used in wear experiments are either higher or comparable to that of the Pt–Au alloy, despite the substantially higher hardness of the ceramic probe materials. High‐resolution microscopy shows negligible surface microstructural evolution in the wear tracks after 100k sliding passes. Mitigation of fatigue‐driven delamination enables a transition to wear by atomic attrition, a regime previously limited to highly wear‐resistant materials such as DLC.</li>

<p>•Production of iron-based shape memory alloy (Fe-SMA) strips at industrial level for civil engineering applications.<br />
•Fe-SMA strips were characterized for application as externally fixed reinforcements for RC members.<br />
•The relaxation behavior of Fe-SMA strips for durations of more than 1000 h was studied.<br />
•The effects of different parameters on the recovery stress of Fe-SMA strips are investigated.<br />
•Long Fe-SMA strips are activated in air by resistive heating.</p>
<p>Shape memory alloys (SMAs), in the form of bars and strips, can be used as prestressing elements in new reinforced concrete (RC) members or for strengthening existing RC structures, owing to their special characteristic known as the shape memory effect (SME). When the SME comes into play, the material returns to its initial shape upon heating after having been deformed at ambient temperatures. If a return to the initial shape is prevented by mechanical fixation, stress develops in the SMA. A cost-effective iron-based SMA (Fe-SMA) has been developed for application in civil engineering structures. The composition of the developed alloy is Fe–17Mn–5Si–10Cr–4Ni–1(V,C) (mass%). This Fe-SMA exhibits high tensile strength, excellent shape recovery stress (prestress force), and high elastic stiffness. Moreover, its material cost is low and it is easier to manufacture than nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys. Recently, Fe-SMA strip production has been started at an industrial scale. In this study, the experimentally determined properties of such industrially produced Fe-SMA strips are presented, and their recovery stress and recovery strain have been measured. The effects of prestraining and maximum heating temperature on the obtained recovery stress have been studied. These Fe-SMA strips can be used as external end-fixed reinforcements to strengthen RC structures.</p>

<p><em>phillipsite and Al-tobermorite mineral cements produced through low-temperature water-rock reactions in roman marine concrete</em><br />

<li>Pozzolanic reaction of volcanic ash with hydrated lime is thought to dominate the cementing fabric and durability of 2000-year-old Roman harbor concrete. Pliny the Elder, however, in first century CE emphasized rock-like cementitious processes involving volcanic ash (pulvis) “that as soon as it comes into contact with the waves of the sea and is submerged becomes a single stone mass (fierem unum lapidem), impregnable to the waves and every day stronger” (Naturalis Historia 35.166). Pozzolanic crystallization of Al-tobermorite, a rare, hydrothermal, calcium-silicate-hydrate mineral with cation exchange capabilities, has been previously recognized in relict lime clasts of the concrete. Synchrotron-based X-ray microdiffraction maps of cementitious microstructures in Baianus Sinus and Portus Neronis submarine breakwaters and a Portus Cosanus subaerial pier now reveal that Al-tobermorite also occurs in the leached perimeters of feldspar fragments, zeolitized pumice vesicles, and in situ phillipsite fabrics in relict pores. Production of alkaline pore fluids through dissolution-precipitation, cation-exchange and/or carbonation reactions with Campi Flegrei ash components, similar to processes in altered trachytic and basaltic tuffs, created multiple pathways to post-pozzolanic phillipsite and Al-tobermorite crystallization at ambient seawater and surface temperatures. Long-term chemical resilience of the concrete evidently relied on water-rock interactions, as Pliny the Elder inferred. Raman spectroscopic analyses of Baianus Sinus Al-tobermorite in diverse microstructural environments indicate a cross-linked structure with Al3+ substitution for Si4+ in Q3 tetrahedral sites, and suggest coupled [Al3++Na+] substitution and potential for cation exchange. The mineral fabrics provide a geoarchaeological prototype for developing cementitious processes through low-temperature rock-fluid interactions, subsequent to an initial phase of reaction with lime that defines the activity of natural pozzolans. These processes have relevance to carbonation reactions in storage reservoirs for CO2 in pyroclastic rocks, production of alkali-activated mineral cements in maritime concretes, and regenerative cementitious resilience in waste encapsulations using natural volcanic pozzolans.<br />

<p><em>extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals</em><br />

<p>varying the spacing between twin boundaries, as opposed to maintaining consistent spacing throughout, produces dramatic improvements in a metal’s strength and rate of work hardening — the extent to which a metal strengthens when deformed.<br />
Huajian Gao, a professor in Brown’s School of Engineering who co-led the work, says the research could point toward new manufacturing techniques for high-performance materials.<br />
“This work deals with what’s known as a gradient material, meaning a material in which there’s some gradual variation in its internal makeup,” Gao said. “Gradient materials are a hot research area because they often have desirable properties compared to homogeneous materials. In this case, we wanted to see if a gradient in nanotwin spacing produced new properties.”<br />
Gao and his colleagues have already shown that nanotwins themselves can improve material performance. Nanotwinned copper, for example, has shown to be significantly stronger than standard copper, with an unusually high resistance to fatigue. But this is the first study to test the effects of variable nanotwin spacing.<br />
Gao and his colleagues created copper samples using four distinct components, each with different nanotwin boundary spacing. Spacings ranging from 29 nanometers between boundaries to 72 nanometers. The copper samples were comprised of different combinations of the four components arranged in different orders across the thickness of the sample. The researchers then tested the strength of each composite sample, as well as the strength of each of the four components.<br />
The tests showed that all of the composites were stronger than the average strength of the four components from which they were made. Remarkably, one of the composites was actually stronger than the strongest of its constituent components.<br />
“To give an analogy, we think of a chain as being only as strong as its weakest link,” Gao said. “But here, we have a situation in which our chain is actually stronger than its strongest link, which is really quite amazing.”<br />
Other tests showed that the composites also had higher rates of work hardening than the average of their constituent components.<br />
To understand the mechanism behind these increases in performance, the researchers used computer simulations of their samples’ atomic structure under strain. At the atomic level, metals respond to strain through the motion of dislocations — line defects in the crystalline structure where atoms are pushed out of place. The way in which those dislocations grow and interact with each other is what determines a metal’s strength.<br />
The simulations revealed that the density of dislocations is much higher in the gradient copper than in a normal metal.<br />
“We found a unique type of dislocation we call bundles of concentrated dislocations, which lead to dislocations an order of magnitude denser than normal,” Gao said. “This type of dislocation doesn’t occur in other materials and it’s why this gradient copper is so strong.”<br />
Gao said that while the research team used copper for this study, nanotwins can be produced in other metals as well. So it’s possible that nanotwin gradients could improve the properties of other metals.</p>

Microstructural gradients are increasingly being introduced into a wide range of engineering materials, providing them with enhanced strength, hardness, work hardening, ductility, and fatigue resistance through deformation mechanisms that are distinct from those operating in gradient-free counterparts.</p>

<p>Platinum is expensive, so it would be desirable to find other alternative materials to replace it,&quot; said senior author Liwei Lin, professor of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. &quot;We are actually using something similar to the Jell-O that you can eat as the foundation, and mixing it with some of the abundant earth elements to create an inexpensive new material for important catalytic reactions.&quot;</p>
<p>This study was made available online in Oct. 2018 in the journal Advanced Materials ahead of final publication in print on Dec. 13.</p>
<p>A zap of electricity can break apart the strong bonds that tie water molecules together, creating oxygen and hydrogen gas, the latter of which is an extremely valuable source of energy for powering hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen gas can also be used to help store energy from renewable yet intermittent energy sources like solar and wind power, which produce excess electricity when the sun shines or when the wind blows, but which go dormant on rainy or calm days.</p>
<p>But simply sticking an electrode in a glass of water is an extremely inefficient method of generating hydrogen gas. For the past 20 years, scientists have been searching for catalysts that can speed up this reaction, making it practical for large-scale use.</p>
<p>&quot;The traditional way of using water gas to generate hydrogen still dominates in industry. However, this method produces carbon dioxide as byproduct,&quot; said first author Xining Zang, who conducted the research as a graduate student in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. &quot;Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation is growing in the past decade, following the global demand to lower emissions. Developing a highly efficient and low-cost catalyst for electrohydrolysis will bring profound technical, economical and societal benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>To create the catalyst, the researchers followed a recipe nearly as simple as making Jell-O from a box. They mixed gelatin and a metal ion -- either molybdenum, tungsten or cobalt -- with water, and then let the mixture dry.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that as gelatin dries, it self-assembles layer by layer,&quot; Lin said. &quot;The metal ion is carried by the gelatin, so when the gelatin self-assembles, your metal ion is also arranged into these flat layers, and these flat sheets are what give Jell-O its characteristic mirror-like surface.&quot;</p>
<p>Heating the mixture to 600 degrees Celsius triggers the metal ion to react with the carbon atoms in the gelatin, forming large, nanometer-thin sheets of metal carbide. The unreacted gelatin burns away.</p>
<p>The researchers tested the efficiency of the catalysts by placing them in water and running an electric current through them. When stacked up against each other, molybdenum carbide split water the most efficiently, followed by tungsten carbide and then cobalt carbide, which didn't form thin layers as well as the other two. Mixing molybdenum ions with a small amount of cobalt boosted the performance even more.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible that other forms of carbide may provide even better performance,&quot; Lin said.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional shape of the catalyst is one of the reasons why it is so successful. That is because the water has to be in contact with the surface of the catalyst in order to do its job, and the large surface area of the sheets mean that the metal carbides are extremely efficient for their weight.</p>
<p>Because the recipe is so simple, it could easily be scaled up to produce large quantities of the catalyst, the researchers say.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that the performance is very close to the best catalyst made of platinum and carbon, which is the gold standard in this area,&quot; Lin said. &quot;This means that we can replace the very expensive platinum with our material, which is made in a very scalable manufacturing process.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Low‐dimensional (0/1/2 dimension) transition metal carbides (TMCs) possess intriguing electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties, and they serve as convenient supports for transition metal catalysts. Large‐area single‐crystalline 2D TMC sheets are generally prepared by exfoliating MXene sheets from MAX phases. Here, a versatile bottom‐up method is reported for preparing ultrathin TMC sheets (≈10 nm in thickness and &gt;100 μm in lateral size) with metal nanoparticle decoration. A gelatin hydrogel is employed as a scaffold to coordinate metal ions (Mo5+, W6+, Co2+), resulting in ultrathin‐film morphologies of diverse TMC sheets. Carbonization of the scaffold at 600 °C presents a facile route to the corresponding MoCx, WCx, CoCx, and to metal‐rich hybrids (Mo2−xWxC and W/Mo2C–Co). Among these materials, the Mo2C–Co hybrid provides excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency (Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1 and 48 mVj = 10 mA cm‐2 in overpotential in 0.5 m H2SO4). Such performance makes Mo2C–Co a viable noble‐metal‐free catalyst for the HER, and is competitive with the standard platinum on carbon support. This template‐assisted, self‐assembling, scalable, and low‐cost manufacturing process presents a new tactic to construct low‐dimensional TMCs with applications in various clean‐energy‐related fields.</p>

<p>But while we've been producing ammonia at a large scale since the 1930s, it has been accomplished mainly in hulking chemical plants requiring vast amounts of hydrogen gas from fossil fuels -- making ammonia among the most energy-intensive among all large-volume chemicals.</p>
<p>A pair of researchers at Case Western Reserve University -- one an expert in electro-chemical synthesis, the other in applications of plasmas -- are working on fixing that.</p>
<p>Researchers Julie Renner and Mohan Sankaran have come up with a new way to create ammonia from nitrogen and water at low temperature and low pressure. They've done it successfully so far in a laboratory without using hydrogen or the solid metal catalyst necessary in traditional processes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our approach -- an electrolytic process with a plasma -- is completely new,&quot; said Mohan Sankaran, the Goodrich Professor of Engineering Innovation at the Case School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Plasmas, often referred to as the fourth state of matter (apart from solid, liquid or gas), are ionized clouds of gas, consisting of positive ions and free electrons, which give it the unique ability to activate chemical bonds, including the rather challenging nitrogen molecule, at room temperature.</p>
<p>Renner, a Climo Assistant Professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department, added that because this new process doesn't need high pressure or high temperature or hydrogen, it makes it scalable -- &quot;the ideal kind of technology for a much smaller plant, one with high potential to be powered by renewable energy.&quot;</p>
<p>The results of their two-year collaboration were published this month in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>History lesson: The Haber-Bosch process</p>
<p>Virtually all commercial ammonia is made from nitrogen and hydrogen, using an iron catalyst at high temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>German physical chemist Fritz Haber received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1918 for developing this process, which made manufacturing ammonia economically feasible.</p>
<p>But the process became more economically profitable when industrial chemist Carl Bosch (who also won a Nobel Prize in 1931) brought the method into a large-scale system. The process was further propelled by a second innovation: the development of steam methane reforming that made hydrogen more accessible and less expensive.</p>
<p>So, what became known as the Haber-Bosch process became the go-to global method for fixing nitrogen and hydrogen to make ammonia.</p>
<p>But Haber-Bosch was never the only approach to nitrogen fixation, it was just the turn-of-the-century winner.</p>
<p>A new, old method rises</p>
<p>Renner and Sankaran have resurrected an element from a little-known Norwegian method that predated Haber-Bosch (the Birkeland-Eyde process) which reacted nitrogen and oxygen to produce nitrates, another chemical that can be used in agriculture. That process lost out to Haber-Bosch mostly because it required even more energy in the form of electricity, a limited resource in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>&quot;Our approach is similar to electrolytic synthesis of ammonia, which has gained interest as an alternative to Haber-Bosch because it can be integrated with renewable energy,&quot; Sankaran said. &quot;However, like the Birkeland-Eyde process, we use a plasma, which is energy intensive. Electricity is still a barrier, but less so now, and with the increase in renewables, it may not be a barrier at all in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;And perhaps most significantly, our process does not produce hydrogen gas,&quot; he said. &quot;This has been the major bottleneck of other electrolytic approaches to forming ammonia from water (and nitrogen), the undesirable formation of hydrogen.&quot;</p>
<p>The Renner-Sankaran process also does not use a solid metal catalyst that could be one of the reasons ammonia is obtained instead of hydrogen.</p>
<p>&quot;In our system, the ammonia is formed at the interface of a gas plasma and liquid water surface and forms freely in solution,&quot; Sankaran said.</p>
<p>So far, the &quot;table-top batches&quot; of ammonia produced by the duo have been very small and the energy efficiency is still less than Haber-Bosch. But with continued optimization, their discovery and development of a new process could someday lead to smaller, more localized ammonia plants which use green energy</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> There is a growing need for scalable ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions that relies on renewable sources of energy and feedstocks to replace the Haber-Bosch process. Electrically driven approaches are an ideal strategy for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia but, to date, have suffered from low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Here, we present a hybrid electrolytic system characterized by a gaseous plasma electrode that facilitates the study of ammonia formation in the absence of any material surface. We find record-high faradaic efficiency (up to 100%) for ammonia from nitrogen and water at atmospheric pressure and temperature with this system. Ammonia measurements under varying reaction conditions in combination with scavengers reveal that the unprecedented selectivity is achieved by solvated electrons produced at the plasma-water interface, which react favorably with protons to produce the key hydrogen radical intermediate. Our results demonstrate that limitations in selectivity can be circumvented by using catalyst-free solvated electron chemistry. In the absence of adsorption steps, the importance of controlling proton concentration and transport is also revealed.</p>

<p><em>cooking chemistry transforms proteins into high-strength adhesives</em><br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>Wilker studies how marine animals, such as oysters and mussels, create natural adhesives. Unlike most glues you'd find in a hardware store, these adhesives are non-toxic, and many hold up underwater. While trying to re-create a new glue in his lab one day, Wilker noticed something strange.</p>
<p>&quot;Things were sticking when they shouldn't have been,&quot; he said. &quot;We found that the components being used, proteins and sugar, were reacting and turning into an adhesive.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the essence of Maillard chemistry, or &quot;cooking chemistry,&quot; for those of us who aren't chemists. It happens when you grill a streak or bake bread in the oven; after a while, the edges start to brown and a savory smell fills the air. Chemically, sugars and proteins are combining to create aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Usually, it takes heat to kick off this process, but Maillard chemistry is a whole class of messy reactions, and it can happen a few different ways. Products of each reaction get involved in their own reactions and can release chemicals that we experience as flavors. Describing the Maillard reaction in detail would take up an entire book alone, according to PBS.</p>
<p>&quot;When foods brown, certain molecules are linking together. Proteins can connect to one another by reacting with sugars,&quot; Wilker said. &quot;When sea creatures make their adhesives, they are also cross-linking proteins together. They use totally different chemistry, but the idea is somewhat similar; cross-linking proteins can create an adhesive.&quot;</p>
<p>This new soy-based adhesive doesn't hold up well under water, so it probably isn't a perfect replacement for the toxic glues used in plywood and chipboard (the fumes from which, when used to build houses, can be breathed in by homeowners for many years). However, it may find use in packaging of organic-certified food products.</p>
<p>&quot;Food packaging usually relies on typical petroleum-based adhesives, which can leach out toxins,&quot; Wilker said.</p>
<p>Not only is this new adhesive made from food components, but it's even stronger than Gorilla Glue on wood. On aluminum, it's about the same. The findings were published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.</p>
<p>To test the strength of the adhesive, Wilker's team glued two pieces of wood or aluminum together. The far ends have a hole for a pin, and a machine pulls them in opposite directions to test their strength. The new adhesive was so strong on wood that the pin ripped through the hole.</p>
<p>Although the soy-based adhesive was pretty strong, the team achieved even better results with a different protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA is a generic protein often used in labs for experiments. It's cheap for researchers, but not cheap enough to make a BSA-based adhesive affordable on a large commercial scale.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to break into the adhesive market, your product needs to be cheap, high-performance, and the material also has to be available on large scales,&quot; Wilker said. &quot;This new soy-based adhesive may be able to hit these requirements while also being grown renewably.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> In prior generations, proteins were taken from horses and other animals to make glues. Petroleum-derived polymers including epoxies and cyanoacrylates have since replaced proteins owing to improved performance. These modern materials come at a cost of toxicity as well as being derived from limited resources. Ideally, replacement adhesives will be made from benign, cheap, and renewable feedstocks. Such a transition to biobased materials, however, will not occur until similar or improved performance can be achieved. We have discovered that coupling of proteins and sugars gives rise to strong adhesives. An unexpected connection was made between adhesion and Maillard chemistry, known to be at the heart of cooking foods. Cross-linked proteins bonded metal and wood with high strengths, in some cases showing forces exceeding those withstood by the substrates themselves. Simple cooking chemistry may provide a route to future high-performance materials derived from low-cost, environmentally benign components.</p>

<p><em>squid-inspired tandem repeat proteins: functional fibers and films</em><br />

<p>&quot;Nature produces a variety of smart materials capable of environmental sensing, self-healing and exceptional mechanical function. These materials, or biopolymers, have unique physical properties that are not readily found in synthetic polymers like plastic. Importantly, biopolymers are sustainable and can be engineered to enhance their physical properties,&quot; explains Demirel.</p>
<p>The oceans, which have borne the brunt of plastic pollution, are at the center of the search for sustainable alternatives. A newly-discovered protein from squid ring teeth (SRT) -- circular predatory appendages located on the suction cups of squid, used to strongly grasp prey -- has gained interest because of its remarkable properties and sustainable production.</p>
<p>The elasticity, flexibility and strength of SRT-based materials, as well as their self-healing, optical, and thermal and electrical conducting properties, can be explained by the variety of molecular arrangements they can adopt. SRT proteins are composed of building blocks arranged in such a way that micro-phase separation occurs. This is a similar situation to oil and water but on a much smaller, nano-scale. The blocks cannot separate completely to produce two distinct layers, so instead molecular-level shapes are created, such as repeating cylindrical blocks, disordered tangles or ordered layers. The shapes formed dictate the property of the material and scientists have experimented with these to produce SRT-based products for a variety of uses.</p>
<p>In the textiles industry, SRT protein could address one of the main sources of microplastic pollution by providing an abrasion-resistant coating that reduces microfiber erosion in washing machines. Similarly, a self-healing SRT protein coating could increase the longevity and safety of damage-prone biochemical implants, as well as garments tailored for protection against chemical and biological warfare agents.</p>
<p>It is even possible to interleave multiple layers of SRT proteins with other compounds or technology, which could lead to the development of 'smart' clothes that can protect us from pollutants in the air while also keeping an eye on our health. The optical properties of SRT-based materials mean these clothes could also display information about our health or surroundings. Flexible SRT-based photonic devices -- components that create, manipulate or detect light, such as LEDs and optical displays, which are typically manufactured with hard materials like glass and quartz -- are currently in development.</p>
<p>&quot;SRT photonics are biocompatible and biodegradable, so could be used to make not only wearable health monitors but also implantable devices for biosensing and biodetection,&quot; adds Demirel.</p>
<p>No squid was harmed in the making of this film</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of SRT-based materials over synthetic materials and plastics made from fossil fuels are its eco-credentials. SRT proteins are cheaply and easily produced from renewable resources and researchers have found a way of producing it without catching a squid. &quot;We don't want to deplete natural squid resources and hence we produce these proteins in genetically modified bacteria. The process is based on fermentation and uses sugar, water, and oxygen to produce biopolymers,&quot; explains Demirel.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the SRT-based prototypes will soon become available more widely, but more development is needed.</p>
<p>Demirel explains, &quot;Scaling up these materials requires additional work. We are now working on the processing technology of these materials so that we can make them available in industrial manufacturing processes.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Production of repetitive polypeptides that comprise one or more tandem copies of a single unit with distinct amorphous and ordered regions have been an interest for the last couple of decades. Their molecular structure provides a rich architecture that can micro-phase-separate to form periodic nanostructures (e.g., lamellar and cylindrical repeating phases) with enhanced physicochemical properties via directed or natural evolution that often exceed those of conventional synthetic polymers. Here, we review programmable design, structure, and properties of functional fibers and films from squid-inspired tandem repeat proteins, with applications in soft photonics and advanced textiles among others.</p>

<p><em>nanoparticle-enabled phase control for arc welding of unweldable aluminum alloy 7075</em><br />

<li>Lightweight materials are of paramount importance to reduce energy consumption and emissions in today’s society. For materials to qualify for widespread use in lightweight structural assembly, they must be weldable or joinable, which has been a long-standing issue for high strength aluminum alloys, such as 7075 (AA7075) due to their hot crack susceptibility during fusion welding. Here, we show that AA7075 can be safely arc welded without hot cracks by introducing nanoparticle-enabled phase control during welding. Joints welded with an AA7075 filler rod containing TiC nanoparticles not only exhibit fine globular grains and a modified secondary phase, both which intrinsically eliminate the materials hot crack susceptibility, but moreover show exceptional tensile strength in both as-welded and post-weld heat-treated conditions. This rather simple twist to the filler material of a fusion weld could be generally applied to a wide range of hot crack susceptible materials.</li>

<p><em>bacterially produced, nacre‐inspired composite materials</em><br />
ewa m. spiesz et al. 2019<br />

<p>One natural substance scientists have looked to in creating synthetic materials is nacre, also known as mother-of-pearl. An exceptionally tough, stiff material produced by some mollusks and serving as their inner shell layer, it also comprises the outer layer of pearls, giving them their lustrous shine.</p>
<p>But while nacre's unique properties make it an ideal inspiration in the creation of synthetic materials, most methods used to produce artificial nacre are complex and energy intensive.</p>
<p>Now, a biologist at the University of Rochester has invented an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method for making artificial nacre using an innovative component: bacteria. The artificial nacre created by Anne S. Meyer, an associate professor of biology at Rochester, and her colleagues is made of biologically produced materials and has the toughness of natural nacre, while also being stiff and, surprisingly, bendable.</p>
<p>The method used to create the novel material could lead to new applications in medicine, engineering -- and even constructing buildings on the moon.</p>
<p>IMPRESSIVE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES</p>
<p>The impressive mechanical properties of natural nacre arise from its hierarchical, layered structure, which allows energy to disperse evenly across the material. In a paper published in the journal Small, Meyer and her colleagues outline their method of using two strains of bacteria to replicate these layers. When they examined the samples under an electron microscope, the structure created by the bacteria was layered similarly to nacre produced naturally by mollusks.</p>
<p>Although nacre-inspired materials have been created synthetically before, the methods used to make them typically involve expensive equipment, extreme temperatures, high-pressure conditions, and toxic chemicals, Meyer says. &quot;Many people creating artificial nacre use polymer layers that are only soluble in nonaqueous solutions, an organic solvent, and then they have this giant bucket of waste at the end of the procedure that has to be disposed of.&quot;</p>
<p>To produce nacre in Meyer's lab, however, all researchers have to do is grow bacteria and let it sit in a warm place.</p>
<p>FROM BACTERIA TO NACRE</p>
<p>In order to make the artificial nacre, Meyer and her team create alternating thin layers of crystalized calcium carbonate -- like cement -- and sticky polymer. They first take a glass or plastic slide and place it in a beaker containing the bacteria Sporosarcina pasteurii, a calcium source, and urea (in the human body, urea is the waste product excreted by the kidneys during urination). This combination triggers the crystallization of calcium carbonate. To make the polymer layer, they place the slide into a solution of the bacteria Bacillus licheniformis, then let the beaker sit in an incubator.</p>
<p>Right now it takes about a day to build up a layer, approximately five micrometers thick, of calcium carbonate and polymer. Meyer and her team are currently looking at coating other materials like metal with the nacre, and &quot;we're trying new techniques to make thicker, nacre-like materials faster and that could be the entire material itself,&quot; Meyer says.</p>
<p>BUILDING HOUSES ON THE MOON</p>
<p>One of the most beneficial characteristics of the nacre produced in Meyer's lab is that it is biocompatible -- made of materials the human body produces or that humans can eat naturally anyway. This makes the nacre ideal for medical applications like artificial bones and implants, Meyer says. &quot;If you break your arm, for example, you might put in a metal pin that has to be removed with a second surgery after your bone heals. A pin made out of our material would be stiff and tough, but you wouldn't have to remove it.&quot;</p>
<p>And, while the material is tougher and stiffer than most plastics, it is very lightweight, a quality that is especially valuable for transportation vehicles like airplanes, boats, or rockets, where every extra pound means extra fuel. Because the production of bacterial nacre doesn't require any complex instruments, and the nacre coating protects against chemical degradation and weathering, it holds promise for civil engineering applications like crack prevention, protective coatings for erosion control, or for conservation of cultural artifacts, and could be useful in the food industry, as a sustainable packaging material.</p>
<p>The nacre might also be an ideal material to build houses on the moon and other planets: the only necessary &quot;ingredients&quot; would be an astronaut and a small tube of bacteria, Meyer says. &quot;The moon has a large amount of calcium in the moon dust, so the calcium's already there. The astronaut brings the bacteria, and the astronaut makes the urea, which is the only other thing you need to start making calcium carbonate layers.&quot;</p>
<p>Even beyond its qualities as an ideal structural material, nacre itself -- as any pearl jewelry owner knows -- is &quot;very beautiful,&quot; Meyer says, owing to its stacked layers. Each stacked layer is approximately the same wavelength as visible light. When light hits the nacre, &quot;the wavelengths of light interact with these layers of the same height so it bounces back off in the same wavelength as visible light.&quot; While the bacterial nacre does not interact with visible light because the layers are thicker than natural nacre, it could interact with infrared wavelengths and bounce infrared off itself, Meyer says, which &quot;may offer unique optical properties.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The impressive mechanical properties of natural composites, such as nacre, arise from their multiscale hierarchical structures, which span from nano‐ to macroscale and lead to effective energy dissipation. While some synthetic bioinspired materials have achieved the toughness of natural nacre, current production methods are complex and typically involve toxic chemicals, extreme temperatures, and/or high pressures. Here, the exclusive use of bacteria to produce nacre‐inspired layered calcium carbonate‐polyglutamate composite materials that reach and exceed the toughness of natural nacre, while additionally exhibiting high extensibility and maintaining high stiffness, is introduced. The extensive diversity of bacterial metabolic abilities and the possibility of genetic engineering allows for the creation of a library of bacterially produced, cost‐effective, and eco‐friendly composite materials.</p>

<p><em>piece by piece-electrochemical synthesis of individual nanoparticles and their performance in orr electrocatalysis</em><br />

<p>Researchers at Ruhr-Universität Bochum and the Fritz Haber Institute Berlin have developed a new method of using rare and expensive catalysts as sparingly as possible. They enclosed a precious metal salt in outer shells, tiny micelles, and had them strike against a carbon electrode, thus coating the surface with nanoparticles of the precious metal contained in the micelles. At the same time, the team was able to precisely analyse how much of the metal was deposited. The researchers then showed that the electrode coated in this manner could efficiently catalyse the oxygen reduction, which is the limiting chemical process in fuel cells.</p>
<p>The team led by Professor Kristina Tschulik and Mathies Evers from the Bochum Research Group for Electrochemistry and Nanoscale Materials describes the process in the journal Angewandte Chemie, published online in advance on 11 April 2019.</p>
<p>Producing particles of the same size</p>
<p>The research group produced the gold nanoparticles with the help of micelles. The particles initially consisted of a precursor substance, chloroauric acid, which was wrapped in an outer polymer shell. The benefit: &quot;When we produce gold nanoparticles using micelles, the nanoparticles are all of an almost identical size,&quot; says Kristina Tschulik, a Principal Investigator of the Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation (Resolv). Only a certain load of the precursor material, from which a single particle of a certain size is produced, fits inside the small micelles. &quot;As particles of different sizes have different catalytic properties, it is important to control the particle size by means of the load quantity of the micelle,&quot; adds Tschulik.</p>
<p>Uniform coating, even on complex surfaces</p>
<p>To coat the cylindrical electrode, the researchers immersed it in a solution containing the loaded micelles and applied a voltage to the electrode. The random motion of the micelles in the solution caused them to strike against the electrode surface over time. There, the outer shell burst open and the gold ions from the chloroauric acid reacted to form elemental gold, which adhered to the electrode surface as a uniform layer of nanoparticles. &quot;Only flat substrates can be coated uniformly with nanoparticles using standard methods,&quot; explains Tschulik. &quot;Our process means that even complex surfaces can be loaded uniformly with a catalyst.&quot;</p>
<p>Separated quantity precisely controllable</p>
<p>While the gold ions from the chloroauric acid react to form elemental gold, electrons flow. By measuring the resulting current, the chemists can determine exactly how much material was used to coat the electrode. At the same time, the method registers the impact of each individual particle and its size.</p>
<p>The researchers successfully tested the oxygen reduction reaction of the electrodes coated using the new process. They achieved an activity as high as that of naked gold nanoparticles without an outer shell. Due to the uniform coating of the surface, they also observed a reaction rate almost as high as that of electrodes completely covered with gold and solid gold electrodes at just eleven percent coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The impact of individual HAuCl4 nanoreactors is measured electrochemically, which provides operando insights and precise control over the modification of electrodes with functional nanoparticles of well‐defined size. Uniformly sized micelles are loaded with a dissolved metal salt. These solution‐phase precursor entities are then reduced electrochemically—one by one—to form nanoparticles (NPs). The charge transferred during the reduction of each micelle is measured individually and allows operando sizing of each of the formed nanoparticles. Thus, particles of known number and sizes can be deposited homogenously even on nonplanar electrodes. This is demonstrated for the decoration of cylindrical carbon fibre electrodes with 25±7 nm sized Au particles from HAuCl4‐filled micelles. These Au NP‐decorated electrodes show great catalyst performance for ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) already at low catalyst loadings. Hence, collisions of individual precursor‐filled nanocontainers are presented as a new route to nanoparticle‐modified electrodes with high catalyst utilization.</p>

We produce all of the necessary single strands of DNA for several DNA origami using shaker-flask cultures, and demonstrate end-to-end production of macroscopic amounts of a DNA origami nanorod in a litre-scale stirred-tank bioreactor. Our method is compatible with existing DNA origami design frameworks and retains the modularity and addressability of DNA origami objects that are necessary for implementing custom modifications using functional groups. With all of the production and purification steps amenable to scaling, we expect that our method will expand the scope of DNA nanotechnology in many areas of science and technology.</li>

<p><em>directing the outcome of co2 reduction at bismuth cathodes using varied ionic liquid promoters</em><br />

<li>Ionic liquids (ILs) have been established as effective promoters for the electrocatalytic upconversion of CO2 to various commodity chemicals. Imidazolium ([Im]+) cathode combinations have been reported to selectively catalyze the 2e–/2H+ reduction of CO2 to CO. Recently our laboratory has reported energy-efficient systems for CO production featuring inexpensive bismuth-based cathode materials and ILs comprised of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium cations. As part of our ongoing efforts to understand the factors that drive CO2 reduction at electrode interfaces, we sought to evaluate the catalytic performance of alternative ILs in combination with previously described Bi cathodes. In this work, we demonstrate that protic ionic liquids (PILs) derived from 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) effectively promote the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate (HCOO–) with high selectivity. The use of PILs comprised of the conjugate acid of DBU, [DBU-H]+, efficiently catalyzed the reduction of CO2 to HCOO– (FEFA ≈ 80%) with significant suppression of CO production (FECO ≈ 20%) in either MeCN or MeCN/H2O (95/5) solution. When they were used in combination with [DBU-H]+-based PILs, Bi-based cathodes achieved current densities for CO2 reduction (<em>j</em>tot ≈ 25–45 mA/cm2) that are comparable to or greater than those reported with imidazolium ILs such as [BMIM]PF6. As we demonstrate herein, the selectivity of the 2e– reduction of CO2 toward HCOO– or CO can be dictated through the choice of the IL promoter present in the electrolysis solution, even in cases in which the same electrocatalyst material is studied. These findings highlight the tunability of bismuth/IL systems for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with high efficiency and rapid kinetics.</li>

<li>Proteins are insulating molecular solids, yet even those containing easily reduced or oxidized centers can have single-molecule electronic conductances that are too large to account for with conventional transport theories. Here, we report the observation of remarkably high electronic conductance states in an electrochemically-inactive protein, the ~200 kD V3 extracelluar domain of human integrin. Large current pulses (up to nA) were observed for long durations (many ms, corresponding to many pC of charge transfer) at large gap (&gt;5nm) distances in an STM when the protein was bound specifically by a small peptide ligand attached to the electrodes. The effect is greatly reduced when a homologous, weakly-binding protein (41) is used as a control. In order to overcome the limitations of the STM, the time- and voltage-dependence of the conductance were further explored using a fixed-gap (5 nm) tunneling junction device that was small enough to trap a single protein molecule at any one time. Transitions to a high conductance (~ nS) state were observed, the protein being “on” for times from ms to tenths of a second. The high-conductance states only occur above ~ 100mV applied bias, and thus are not an equilibrium property of the protein. Nanoamp two-level signals indicate the specific capture of a single molecule in an electrode gap functionalized with the ligand. This offers a new approach to label-free electronic detection of single protein molecules. Electronic structure calculations yield a distribution of energy level spacings that is consistent with a recently proposed quantum-critical state for proteins, in which small fluctuations can drive transitions between localized and band-like electronic states.</li>

<li>Regenerative medicine holds substantial promise for repairing or replacing tissues and organs damaged by disease, injury, and degeneration. Much of the field has focused on development of cell-based therapeutics, gene-based therapeutics, and tissue engineering-based therapeutics. In contrast, development of small molecule regenerative medicine therapies is an emerging area. Using the adult zebrafish as a novel screening platform, we identified MSI-1436 as a first-in-class regenerative medicine drug candidate. MSI-1436 is a naturally occurring aminosterol that inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. Treatment of adult zebrafish by intraperitoneal injection of MSI-1436 increased the rate of regeneration of the amputated caudal fin, which is comprised of bone, connective, skin, vascular and nervous tissues and also increased the rate of adult zebrafish heart regeneration. Intraperitoneal administration of MSI-1436 to adult mice for 4 weeks after induction of myocardial infarction increased survival, improved heart function, reduced infarct size, reduced ventricular wall thinning and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation. Satellite cell activation in injured mouse skeletal muscle was stimulated by MSI-1436. MSI-1436 was well tolerated by patients in Phase 1 and 1b obesity and type 2 diabetes clinical trials. Doses effective at stimulating regeneration are 5–50-times lower than the maximum well tolerated human dose. The demonstrated safety and well established pharmacological properties of MSI-1436 underscore the potential of this molecule as a novel treatment for heart attack and multiple other degenerative diseases.</li>

<p><em>biomimetic tooth repair: amelogenin-derived peptide enables in vitro remineralization of human enamel</em><br />

<li>White spot lesions (WSL) and incipient caries on enamel surfaces are the earliest clinical outcomes for demineralization and caries. If left untreated, the caries can progress and may cause complex restorative procedures or even tooth extraction which destroys soft and hard tissue architecture as a consequence of connective tissue and bone loss. Current clinical practices are insufficient in treating dental caries. A long-standing practical challenge associated with demineralization related to dental diseases is incorporating a functional mineral microlayer which is fully integrated into the molecular structure of the tooth in repairing damaged enamel. This study demonstrates that small peptide domains derived from native protein amelogenin can be utilized to construct a mineral layer on damaged human enamel in vitro. Six groups were prepared to carry out remineralization on artificially created lesions on enamel: (1) no treatment, (2) Ca2+ and PO43– only, (3) 1100 ppm fluoride (F), (4) 20 000 ppm F, (5) 1100 ppm F and peptide, and (6) peptide alone. While the 1100 ppm F sample (indicative of common F content of toothpaste for homecare) did not deliver F to the thinly deposited mineral layer, high F test sample (indicative of clinical varnish treatment) formed mainly CaF2 nanoparticles on the surface. Fluoride, however, was deposited in the presence of the peptide, which also formed a thin mineral layer which was partially crystallized as fluorapatite. Among the test groups, only the peptide-alone sample resulted in remineralization of fairly thick (10 μm) dense mineralized layer containing HAp mineral, resembling the structure of the healthy enamel. The newly formed mineralized layer exhibited integration with the underlying enamel as evident by cross-sectional imaging. The peptide-guided remineralization approach sets the foundation for future development of biomimetic products and treatments for dental health care.</li>

<li>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly envisioned as the next generation of biological pro-regenerative nanotherapeutic agents, as has already been demonstrated for heart, kidney, liver, and brain tissues; lung injury repair; and skin regeneration. Herein, we explore another potential EV therapeutic application, fistula healing, together with a local minimally invasive delivery strategy. Allogenic extracellular vesicles (EVs) from adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are administered in a porcine fistula model through a thermoresponsive Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) gel, injected locally at 4 °C and gelling at body temperature to retain EVs in the entire fistula tract. Complete fistula healing is reported to be 100% for the gel plus EVs group, 67% for the gel group, and 0% for the control, supporting the therapeutic use of Pluronic F-127 gel alone or combined with EVs. However, only the combination of gel and EVs results in a statistically significant (i) reduction of fibrosis, (ii) decline of inflammatory response, (iii) decrease in the density of myofibroblasts, and (iv) increase of angiogenesis. Overall, we demonstrate that ASC-EV delivery into a PF-127 gel represents a successful local minimally invasive strategy to induce a therapeutic effect in a swine fistula model. Our study presents prospects for EV administration strategies and for the management of post-operative fistulas.</li>

<li>Large skeletal defects caused by trauma, congenital malformations, and post-oncologic resections of the calvarium present major challenges to the reconstructive surgeon. We previously identified BMP-9 as the most osteogenic BMP in vitro and in vivo. Here we sought to investigate the bone regenerative capacity of murine-derived calvarial mesenchymal progenitor cells (iCALs) transduced by BMP-9 in the context of healing critical-sized calvarial defects. To accomplish this, the transduced cells were delivered to the defect site within a thermoresponsive biodegradable scaffold consisting of poly(polyethylene glycol citrate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide mixed with gelatin (PPCN-g). A total of three treatment arms were evaluated: PPCN-g alone, PPCN-g seeded with iCALs expressing GFP, and PPCN-g seeded with iCALs expressing BMP-9. Defects treated only with PPCN-g scaffold did not statistically change in size when evaluated at eight weeks postoperatively (p = 0.72). Conversely, both animal groups treated with iCALs showed significant reductions in defect size after 12 weeks of follow-up (BMP9-treated: p = 0.0025; GFP-treated: p = 0.0042). However, H&amp;E and trichrome staining revealed more complete osseointegration and mature bone formation only in the BMP9-treated group. These results suggest that BMP9-transduced iCALs seeded in a PPCN-g thermoresponsive scaffold is capable of inducing bone formation in vivo and is an effective means of creating tissue engineered bone for critical sized defects.</li>

<ul>
<li>Without oxygen, most vertebrates die within minutes as they cannot meet cellular energy demands with anaerobic metabolism. However, fish of the genus <em>Carassius</em> (crucian carp and goldfish) have evolved a specialized metabolic system that allows them to survive prolonged periods without oxygen by producing ethanol as their metabolic end-product. Here we show that this has been made possible by the evolution of a pyruvate decarboxylase, analogous to that in brewer’s yeast and the first described in vertebrates, in addition to a specialized alcohol dehydrogenase. Whole-genome duplication events have provided additional gene copies of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex that have evolved into a pyruvate decarboxylase, while other copies retained the essential function of the parent enzymes. We reveal the key molecular substitution in duplicated pyruvate dehydrogenase genes that underpins one of the most extreme hypoxic survival strategies among vertebrates and that is highly deleterious in humans.</li>

<li>Micro air vehicles (MAVs) are finding use across an expanding range of applications. However, when interacting with the environment, they are limited by the maximum thrust they can produce. Here, we describe FlyCroTugs, a class of robots that adds to the mobility of MAVs the capability of forceful tugging up to 40 times their mass while adhering to a surface. This class of MAVs, which finds inspiration in the prey transportation strategy of wasps, exploits controllable adhesion or microspines to firmly adhere to the ground and then uses a winch to pull heavy objects. The combination of flight and adhesion for tugging creates a class of 100-gram multimodal MAVs that can rapidly traverse cluttered three-dimensional terrain and exert forces that affect human-scale environments. We discuss the energetics and scalability of this approach and demonstrate it for lifting a sensor into a partially collapsed building. We also demonstrate a team of two FlyCroTugs equipped with specialized end effectors for rotating a lever handle and opening a heavy door.</li>

<ul>
<li>We construct genomic predictors for heritable but extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning). The constructed predictors explain, respectively, ∼40, 20, and 9% of total variance for the three traits, in data not used for training. For example, predicted heights correlate ∼0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few centimeters of the prediction. The proportion of variance explained for height is comparable to the estimated common SNP heritability from genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for SNPs. Thus, our results close the gap between prediction R-squared and common SNP heritability. The ∼20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common variants. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for out-of-sample validation of our results.</li>

<ul>
<li>Surgical sealants have been used for sealing or reconnecting ruptured tissues but often have low adhesion, inappropriate mechanical strength, cytotoxicity concerns, and poor performance in biological environments. To address these challenges, we engineered a biocompatible and highly elastic hydrogel sealant with tunable adhesion properties by photocrosslinking the recombinant human protein tropoelastin. The subcutaneous implantation of the methacryloyl-substituted tropoelastin (MeTro) sealant in rodents demonstrated low toxicity and controlled degradation. All animals survived surgical procedures with adequate blood circulation by using MeTro in an incisional model of artery sealing in rats, and animals showed normal breathing and lung function in a model of surgically induced rat lung leakage. In vivo experiments in a porcine model demonstrated complete sealing of severely leaking lung tissue in the absence of sutures or staples, with no clinical or sonographic signs of pneumothorax during 14 days of follow-up. The engineered MeTro sealant has high potential for clinical applications because of superior adhesion and mechanical properties compared to commercially available sealants, as well as opportunity for further optimization of the degradation rate to fit desired surgical applications on different tissues.</li>

<li>In nature, load‐bearing polymeric materials that do not present significant trade‐off between elongation and elastic modulus are often found, but are rare in synthetic systems. One mechanism for emulating these natural systems is with functionally graded materials (FGMs). The development of synthetic FGM systems with varying moduli gradient using tuned poly(meth)acrylate multilayers is shown. Such localized tuning of crosslink density is shown as a mechanism to increase rigidity without significant compromise to maximum strain. The toughest FGM shows 43% higher tensile strength and 9% higher stiffness than copolymer elastomers with similar maximum strain (εmax ≈ 110%), increasing toughness by 25%. These improved tensile mechanical properties can be due to beneficial interlayer crack deflection and delamination. This gradient approach provides potential to improve toughness of various load‐bearing polymeric materials.</li>

<li>Nanoscale emulsions are essential components in numerous products, ranging from processed foods to novel drug delivery systems. Existing emulsification methods rely either on the breakup of larger droplets or solvent exchange/inversion. Here we report a simple, scalable method of creating nanoscale water-in-oil emulsions by condensing water vapor onto a subcooled oil-surfactant solution. Our technique enables a bottom-up approach to forming small-scale emulsions. Nanoscale water droplets nucleate at the oil/air interface and spontaneously disperse within the oil, due to the spreading dynamics of oil on water. Oil-soluble surfactants stabilize the resulting emulsions. We find that the oil-surfactant concentration controls the spreading behavior of oil on water, as well as the peak size, polydispersity, and stability of the resulting emulsions. Using condensation, we form emulsions with peak radii around 100 nm and polydispersities around 10%. This emulsion formation technique may open different routes to creating emulsions, colloidal systems, and emulsion-based materials.</li>

We synthesized a wide range of multicomponent nanoparticles with a desired chemistry (composition), size, and phase (solid solution, phase-separated) by controlling the carbothermal shock (CTS) parameters (substrate, temperature, shock duration, and heating/cooling rate). To prove utility, we synthesized quinary HEA-NPs as ammonia oxidation catalysts with ~100% conversion and &gt;99% nitrogen oxide selectivity over prolonged operations.</li>

<p>new type of origami that can morph from one pattern into a different one, or even a hybrid of two patterns, instantly altering many of its structural characteristics.<br />
The research, which was supported by the National Science Foundation and is to be published April 19 in the journal <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, could unlock new types of origami-based structures or metamaterials that leverage the characteristics of two types of origami.<br />
“This hybrid origami allows for reprogrammable mechanical properties and the ability to change those properties while the material is in service,” said Glaucio Paulino, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.<br />
The researchers started with two types of origami patterns: the Miura-ori and the eggbox, both of which can be formed into sheets of repeating patterns. The Miura-ori looks like rows of folded zig-zags, while the eggbox pattern resembles a mountain range with repeating peaks and valleys.<br />
Both are capable of being compressed into a very small space, but when expanded they behave differently from one another in how they respond to bending. The eggbox pattern resembles a dome when bent, and the Miura-ori takes the shape of a saddle.<br />
“Traditionally, if you have an eggbox pattern, you are locked into the characteristics of that particular pattern,” said Paulino, who is also the Raymond Allen Jones Chair of Engineering in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “With this new pattern, which we are calling morph, that’s no longer the case.”<br />
The new origami pattern achieves its morphing ability by a redesign of the geometry of two of the four planes that comprise one section of the origami. By shrinking those two planes on one side, it enables their creases to shift from a mountain to a valley, or in other words, to fold in the opposite direction.<br />
And importantly, the transition from peak to valley can occur whether the origami is formed from a flexible material such as paper or a rigid material such as metal.<br />
That means, for example, that origami-based structures used for acoustic systems — which already are capable of expanding and contracting to increase or decrease the volume of the sound response — could go one step further, changing how they bend to potentially offer an even greater range of resonant responses. In the example of the drone crash protection system, the new origami pattern could potentially offer other customization options or alter aspects of its impact resistance, Paulino said.<br />
“NSF’s investments in fundamental research of architected materials has pushed the frontiers and created ‘shape-shifting’ structures for applications in space exploration, robotics and medicine,” said Robert B. Stone, NSF’s Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation division director.<br />
The new origami pattern is also capable of taking on a hybrid structure, where certain rows are folded into one configuration and others were folded in the other. In such a configuration, the structure would exhibit characteristics of both types.<br />
“There are a large number of combinations in terms of how these could be configured, which offers a lot of customization possibilities for structures based on the morph pattern,” said Ke Liu, a former graduate student at Georgia Tech and now a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology.<br />
Another unique characteristic of the morph pattern is what happens when a Miura-ori row is situated between two eggbox rows. Typically, when tension is applied to pull apart either of the patterns, they respond by giving in and flattening their shape. However, in this new instance, the Miura-ori pattern locks into place.<br />
“The locking is very strong, and there is no way to break that hold other than to tear the entire structure apart,” said Phanisri Pratapa, a former postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech and now an assistant professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.<br />
The locking could enable structures to limit the amount of expansion possible and change that limit on the fly, Pratapa said.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Exploring the configurational space of specific origami patterns [e.g., Miura-ori (flat surface with parallelogram crease patterns), eggbox] has led to notable advances in science and technology. To augment the origami design space, we present a pattern, named “Morph,” which combines the features of its parent patterns. We introduce a four-vertex origami cell that morphs continuously between a Miura mode and an eggbox mode, forming an homotopy class of configurations. This is achieved by changing the mountain and valley assignment of one of the creases, leading to a smooth switch through a wide range of negative and positive Poisson’s ratios. We present elegant analytical expressions of Poisson’s ratios for both in-plane stretching and out-of-plane bending and find that they are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. Further, we show that by combining compatible unit cells in each of the aforementioned modes through kinematic bifurcation, we can create hybrid origami patterns that display unique properties, such as topological mode locking and tunable switching of Poisson’s ratio.</p>

<li>Solar steam generation, due to its capability of producing clean water directly by solar energy, is emerging as a promising eco-friendly and energy-efficient technology to address global challenges of water crisis and energy shortage. Although diverse materials and architectures have been explored to improve solar energy utilization, high efficiency in solar steam generation could be accomplished only with external optical and thermal management. For the first time, we report a deployable, three-dimensional (3D) origami-based solar steam generator capable of near full utilization of solar energy. This auxetic platform is designed based on Miura-ori tessellation and is able to efficiently recover radiative and convective heat loss as well as to trap solar energy via its periodic concavity pattern. The 3D solar steam generator device with a nanocarbon composite of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes being photothermal component in this work shows a very strong dependence between its solar energy efficiency and surface areal density. The device yields an extraordinary solar energy efficiency close to 100% under 1 sun illumination at a highly folded configuration. The 3D origami device can withstand a great number of folding and unfolding cycles and shows unimpaired solar steam generation performances. The unique structural feature of the 3D origami structure offers a new insight into the future development of highly efficient and easily deployable solar steam generator.</li>

<li>Stretchable conductors are essential components of wearable electronics. However, such materials typically sacrifice their electronic conductivity to achieve mechanical stretchability and elasticity. Here, the nanoconfinement and air/water interfacial assembly is explored to grow freestanding mechanical endurance conducting polymer nanosheets that can be stretched up to 2000% with simultaneously high electrical conductivity, inspired by kirigami. Such stretchable conductors show remarkable electronic and mechanical reversibility and reproducibility under more than 1000 cycle durability tests with 2000% deformability, which can be accurately predicted using finite element modeling. The conductivity of nanoconfined freestanding conductor nanosheets increases by three orders of magnitude from 2.2 × 10−3 to 4.002 S cm−1 is shown, due to the charge‐transfer complex formation between polymer chain and halogen, while the electrical conductance of the stretchable kirigami nanosheets can be maintained over the entire strain regime. The nanoconfined polymer nanosheets can also act as a sensor capable of sensing the pressure with high durability and real‐time monitoring.</li>

<p>&quot;If you were wearing a football helmet made of this material and something hit the helmet, you'd never feel that hit on your head. By the time the energy reaches you, it's no longer pushing. It's pulling,&quot; said corresponding author Jinkyu Yang, a UW associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics.</p>
<p>Yang and his team designed this new metamaterial to have the properties they wanted.</p>
<p>&quot;Metamaterials are like Legos. You can make all types of structures by repeating a single type of building block, or unit cell as we call it,&quot; he said. &quot;Depending on how you design your unit cell, you can create a material with unique mechanical properties that are unprecedented in nature.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers turned to the art of origami to create this particular unit cell.</p>
<p>&quot;Origami is great for realizing the unit cell,&quot; said co-author Yasuhiro Miyazawa, a UW aeronautics and astronautics doctoral student. &quot;By changing where we introduce creases into flat materials, we can design materials that exhibit different degrees of stiffness when they fold and unfold. Here we've created a unit cell that softens the force it feels when someone pushes on it, and it accentuates the tension that follows as the cell returns to its normal shape.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like origami, these unit cell prototypes are made out of paper. The researchers used a laser cutter to cut dotted lines into paper to designate where to fold. The team folded the paper along the lines to form a cylindrical structure, and then glued acrylic caps on either end to connect the cells into a long chain.</p>
<p>The researchers lined up 20 cells and connected one end to a device that pushed and set off a reaction throughout the chain. Using six GoPro cameras, the team tracked the initial compression wave and the following tension wave as the unit cells returned to normal.</p>
<p>The chain composed of the origami cells showed the counterintuitive wave motion: Even though the compressive pushing force from the device started the whole reaction, that force never made it to the other end of the chain. Instead, it was replaced by the tension force that started as the first unit cells returned to normal and propagated faster and faster down the chain. So the unit cells at the end of the chain only felt the tension force pulling them back.</p>
<p>&quot;Impact is a problem we encounter on a daily basis, and our system provides a completely new approach to reducing its effects. For example, we'd like to use it to help both people and cars fare better in car accidents,&quot; Yang said. &quot;Right now it's made out of paper, but we plan to make it out of a composite material. Ideally, we could optimize the material for each specific application.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The principles underlying the art of origami paper folding can be applied to design sophisticated metamaterials with unique mechanical properties. By exploiting the flat crease patterns that determine the dynamic folding and unfolding motion of origami, we are able to design an origami-based metamaterial that can form rarefaction solitary waves. Our analytical, numerical, and experimental results demonstrate that this rarefaction solitary wave overtakes initial compressive strain waves, thereby causing the latter part of the origami structure to feel tension first instead of compression under impact. This counterintuitive dynamic mechanism can be used to create a highly efficient—yet reusable—impact mitigating system without relying on material damping, plasticity, or fracture.</p>

<p><em>remote detection of radioactive material using mid-ir laser–driven electron avalanche</em><br />

<p>&quot;Traditional detection methods rely on a radioactive decay particle interacting directly with a detector. All of these methods decline in sensitivity with distance,&quot; said Robert Schwartz, a physics graduate student at UMD and the lead author of the research paper. &quot;The benefit of our method is that it is inherently a remote process. With further development, it could detect radioactive material inside a box from the length of a football field.&quot;</p>
<p>As radioactive material emits decay particles, the particles strip electrons from -- or ionize -- nearby atoms in the air, creating a small number of free electrons that quickly attach to oxygen molecules. By focusing an infrared laser beam into this area, Schwartz and his colleagues easily detached these electrons from their oxygen molecules, seeding an avalanche-like rapid increase in free electrons that is relatively easy to detect.</p>
<p>&quot;An electron avalanche can start with a single seed electron. Because the air near a radioactive source has some charged oxygen molecules -- even outside a shielded container -- it provides an opportunity to seed an avalanche by applying an intense laser field,&quot; said Howard Milchberg, a professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering at UMD and senior author of the research paper, who also has an appointment at IREAP. &quot;Electron avalanches were among the first demonstrations after the laser was invented. This is not a new phenomenon, but we are the first to use an infrared laser to seed an avalanche breakdown for radiation detection. The laser's infrared wavelength is important, because it can easily and specifically detach electrons from oxygen ions.&quot;</p>
<p>Applying an intense, infrared laser field causes the free electrons caught in the beam to oscillate and collide with atoms nearby. When these collisions become energetic enough, they can rip more electrons away from the atoms.</p>
<p>&quot;A simple view of avalanche is that after one collision, you have two electrons. Then, this happens again and you have four. Then the whole thing cascades until you have full ionization, where all atoms in the system have at least one electron removed,&quot; Milchberg explained.</p>
<p>As the air in the laser's path begins to ionize, it has a measurable effect on the infrared light reflected, or backscattered, toward a detector. By tracking these changes, Schwartz, Milchberg and their colleagues were able to determine when the air began to ionize and how long it took to reach full ionization.</p>
<p>The timing of the ionization process, or the electron avalanche breakdown, gives the researchers an indication of how many seed electrons were available to begin the avalanche. This estimate, in turn, can indicate how much radioactive material is present in the target.</p>
<p>&quot;Timing of ionization is one of the most sensitive ways to detect initial electron density,&quot; said Daniel Woodbury, a physics graduate student at UMD and a co-author of the research paper. &quot;We're using a relatively weak probe laser pulse, but it's 'chirped,' meaning that shorter wavelengths pass though the avalanching air first, then longer ones. By measuring the spectral components of the infrared light that passes through versus what is reflected, we can determine when ionization starts and reaches its endpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers note that their method is highly specific and sensitive to the detection of radioactive material. Without a laser pulse, radioactive material alone will not induce an electron avalanche. Similarly, a laser pulse alone will not induce an avalanche, without the seed electrons created by the radioactive material.</p>
<p>While the method remains a proof-of-concept exercise for now, the researchers envision further engineering developments that they hope will enable practical applications to enhance security at ports of entry across the globe.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we're working with a lab-sized laser, but in 10 years or so, engineers may be able to fit a system like this inside a van,&quot; Schwartz said. &quot;Anywhere you can park a truck, you can deploy such a system. This would provide a very powerful tool to monitor activity at ports.&quot;</p>

<p><em>bioinspired mechanical device generates plasma in water via cavitation</em><br />

<p>3D printing technology to replicate not only the physical shape of a snapping shrimp's claw, but also the complex mechanism through which it generates plasma.</p>
<p>The team's research was published March 15 in the online journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally, when you look to nature, evolutionary pressure makes it so that nature is very efficient at doing things,&quot; Staack said. &quot;I find it interesting that the shrimp has been doing intense shock waves, plasma chemistry and nanoparticle synthesis for millions of years.&quot;</p>
<p>When the snapping shrimp -- also known as the pistol shrimp -- snaps its claw, it shoots out a jet of water fast enough to generate a bubble which, when it collapses, creates a loud noise and emits light. The high pressures and temperatures produced in this process lead to plasma formation.</p>
<p>The project, led by Staack, began more than four years ago as an offshoot of a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project on electrical discharge plasma in liquids. In comparing the plasma-generation process of the snapping shrimp to their electrical plasma process, the researchers became curious if they could find a way to measure and replicate its properties.</p>
<p>The researchers set out to mimic the mechanics of the snapping shrimp's claw with initial support from the NSF, carefully studying how the sea creature creates a cavitation bubble that generates plasma at upwards of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>&quot;In our paper, we report the first direct imaging of the light emission induced by the same method the shrimp uses: the mechanically generated energy focusing on a collapsingcavitation and the following shockwave propagation,&quot; Staack said. &quot;The bio-inspired mechanical design allowed us to carry out repetitive and consistent experiments on the plasma generation and indicate a significant increase in conversion efficiency compared to sonic, laser and electric induced cavitation.&quot;</p>
<p>Staack said the use of 3D printing was instrumental in the progression of this project, allowing the researchers to create an accurate, scaled-up model of the snapping shrimp's claw in a way that was impossible just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at replicating the shrimp's behavior focused on the two-dimensional geometry of the shrimp, ultimately missing some of the complex 3D processes that newer technology allowed the researchers to recreate the mechanism successfully.</p>
<p>Staack and Tang created a 3D model of a snapping shrimp's molted claw husk five-times larger than it appears in nature. To power the mechanism without the aid of the shrimp's muscles, the researchers implemented a mousetrap-like spring system.</p>
<p>In nature, shrimp use the cavitation bubble as a weapon to generate shocks and stun their prey. A scaled-up version of the shrimp's mechanism could be used for a broad range of disciplines including analytical chemistry, physics and material processing.</p>
<p>&quot;Shrimp use the systems as a weapon and that is certainly one application,&quot; Staack said. &quot;The pressure and shocks can stun small fish or break-up a kidney stone. The cavitation and dynamics can be used to modify boundary layer flow and reduce drag for a boat. Other applications take advantage of the chemistry of the plasma state. Nanoparticles can be synthesized with exotic phases due to the extreme conditions during synthesis. Water can be sterilized. Oil can be upgraded.&quot;</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the snapping shrimp's plasma and shockwave capabilities, Staack is working with a team of colleagues from the mechanical engineering department on a spin-off project to advance the drilling technology used to create geothermal wells that tap into the Earth's natural heat. By enabling electrodes on the tip of a drill bit to emit a microscopic plasma discharge, the technology will help break through hard rock and streamline the drilling process.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Staack said some of the goals for future research include determining the temperature of the plasma generated, finding out how large they can scale up the mechanism and testing some potential applications.</p>
<p>They are also working on refining the most efficient version of the mechanism, removing parts from the claw model that do not serve a purpose in the creation of plasma.</p>
<p>&quot;What we've learned from this is that we don't need all of this shrimp biology,&quot; Staack said. &quot;We need the little back plunger and we need the channel, but we don't need the part that the shrimp uses to hit with. There are some things which evolved for different reasons. Some of the things we're doing now are figuring out what the distilled version of this mechanism is.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Nature can generate plasma in liquids more efficiently than human-designed devices using electricity, acoustics, or light. In the animal world, snapping shrimp can induce cavitation that collapses to produce high pressures and temperatures, leading to efficient plasma formation with photon and shock wave emission via energy focusing. Here, we report a bioinspired mechanical device that mimics the plasma generation technique of the snapping shrimp. This device was manufactured using additive manufacturing based on micro–x-ray computed tomography of a snapping shrimp claw molt. A spring fixture was designed to reliably actuate the claw with appropriate force and velocity to produce a high-speed water jet that matches the cavitation number and Reynolds number of the shrimp. Light emission and shocks were imaged, which indicate that our device reproduces the shrimp’s plasma generation technique and is more efficient than other plasma generation methods.</p>

<p><em>the macaque anterior cingulate cortex translates counterfactual choice value into actual behavioral change</em><br />
elsa f. fouragnan et al. 2019<br />

<p>low–intensity ultrasound affecting the brain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>counterfactual thinking is causally related to a frontal part of the brain, called the anterior cingulate cortex. And scientists have proven that the process can be changed by targeting neurons (nerve cells) in this region using low-intensity ultrasound.</p>
<p>The study was led by Dr Elsa Fouragnan at the University of Plymouth and published Monday 15 April in Nature Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Counterfactual thinking is an important cognitive process by which humans and animals make decisions -- not only based on what they are currently experiencing, but by comparing their present experience with potential alternatives. In typical circumstances, should these alternatives become available in the near future, one would adaptively switch to them. For example, if the sun was shining while working, one would go out and enjoy the sun as soon as work is done.</p>
<p>If neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex are not working properly, then it would not be possible to switch to alternative options, even when these alternatives are the best available. Scientists believe that this is what happens in some psychiatric conditions where people are stuck in dysfunctional habits.</p>
<p>The study showed for the first time how low-intensity ultrasonic waves can be used to non-invasively, and with pinpoint accuracy, modulate normal brain function -- affecting counterfactual thinking and the ability to switch to better alternative.</p>
<p>The research, conducted in macaques monkeys, follows previous work highlighting the safeness of the non-invasive ultrasound technique and its effect on the brain.</p>
<p>In the study, the macaques were tasked with finding a treat from a variety of options. They quickly learned which one was best, but the 'best' option was not always available to choose. Thus, they had to keep it in mind for when it became available again.</p>
<p>After showing that the cingulate cortex was linked with remembering which option was best, researchers used low intensity ultrasound to modulate the activity in this brain region and see its effect on behaviours. When the neurons were stimulated, their counterfactual thinking was impaired.</p>
<p>Dr Fouragnan explained why the findings were so significant and what it could mean for future treatment: &quot;This is a really exciting study for two main reasons -- firstly because we discovered that the cingulate cortex is crucial to help switch to better alternatives, and secondly because low-intensity ultrasound can be used to reversibly change brain activity in very precise part of the brain,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is well known as an imaging tool -- in pregnancy, for example -- but it can also be used as a therapeutic method, particularly for safely modulating brain activity. This is possible because the mechanical vibrations caused by ultrasonic waves can cause the generation or suppression of electrical signals in the brain, which in turn can be used to restore normal brain function.</p>
<p>Dr Fouragnan continued: &quot;Ultrasound neurostimulation is an early-stage, non-invasive therapeutic technology that has the potential to improve the lives of millions of patients with mental health conditions by stimulating brain tissues with millimetre accuracy. Presently, neuromodulation techniques do exist for humans, to help people with conditions such as major depression or Parkinson's. But there are no techniques that have this level of accuracy while remaining non-invasive.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The neural mechanisms mediating sensory-guided decision-making have received considerable attention, but animals often pursue behaviors for which there is currently no sensory evidence. Such behaviors are guided by internal representations of choice values that have to be maintained even when these choices are unavailable. We investigated how four macaque monkeys maintained representations of the value of counterfactual choices—choices that could not be taken at the current moment but which could be taken in the future. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found two different patterns of activity co-varying with values of counterfactual choices in a circuit spanning the hippocampus, the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Anterior cingulate cortex activity also reflected whether the internal value representations would be translated into actual behavioral change. To establish the causal importance of the anterior cingulate cortex for this translation process, we used a novel technique, transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation, to reversibly disrupt anterior cingulate cortex activity.</p>

<p><em>temperature and humidity based projections of a rapid rise in global heat stress exposure during the 21st century</em><br />
ethan david coffel et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa00e">http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa00e</a></p>
<ul>
<li>As a result of global increases in both temperature and specific humidity, heat stress is projected to intensify throughout the 21st century. Some of the regions most susceptible to dangerous heat and humidity combinations are also among the most densely populated. Consequently, there is the potential for widespread exposure to wet bulb temperatures that approach and in some cases exceed postulated theoretical limits of human tolerance by mid- to late-century. We project that by 2080 the relative frequency of present-day extreme wet bulb temperature events could rise by a factor of 100–250 (approximately double the frequency change projected for temperature alone) in the tropics and parts of the mid-latitudes, areas which are projected to contain approximately half the world’s population. In addition, population exposure to wet bulb temperatures that exceed recent deadly heat waves may increase by a factor of five to ten, with 150–750 million person-days of exposure to wet bulb temperatures above those seen in today’s most severe heat waves by 2070–2080. Under RCP 8.5, exposure to wet bulb temperatures above 35 °C—the theoretical limit for human tolerance—could exceed a million person-days per year by 2080. Limiting emissions to follow RCP 4.5 entirely eliminates exposure to that extreme threshold. Some of the most affected regions, especially Northeast India and coastal West Africa, currently have scarce cooling infrastructure, relatively low adaptive capacity, and rapidly growing populations. In the coming decades heat stress may prove to be one of the most widely experienced and directly dangerous aspects of climate change, posing a severe threat to human health, energy infrastructure, and outdoor activities ranging from agricultural production to military training.</li>

<p><em>a robust data-driven approach identifies four personality types across four large data sets</em><br />

<li>Understanding human personality has been a focus for philosophers and scientists for millennia<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR1">57</a>. It is now widely accepted that there are about five major personality domains that describe the personality profile of an individual<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR2">58</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR3">59</a>. In contrast to personality traits, the existence of personality types remains extremely controversial<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR4">60</a>. Despite the various purported personality types described in the literature, small sample sizes and the lack of reproducibility across data sets and methods have led to inconclusive results about personality types<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR5">61</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0419-z#ref-CR6">62</a>. Here we develop an alternative approach to the identification of personality types, which we apply to four large data sets comprising more than 1.5 million participants. We find robust evidence for at least four distinct personality types, extending and refining previously suggested typologies. We show that these types appear as a small subset of a much more numerous set of spurious solutions in typical clustering approaches, highlighting principal limitations in the blind application of unsupervised machine learning methods to the analysis of big data.</li>
