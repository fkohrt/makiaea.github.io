<p><em>rational snacking: young children’s decision-making on the marshmallow task is moderated by beliefs about environmental reliability</em><br />
celeste kidd et al. 2012<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2012.08.004">doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2012.08.004</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Children wait longer in the marshmallow task when the experimenter is reliable. • Children’s behavior on this task is likely influenced by rational factors. • Self-control is not the sole determinant in delay-of-gratification success.</p>
<p>Children are notoriously bad at delaying gratification to achieve later, greater rewards (e.g., Piaget, 1970)—and some are worse at waiting than others. Individual differences in the ability-to-wait have been attributed to self-control, in part because of evidence that long-delayers are more successful in later life (e.g., Shoda, Mischel, &amp; Peake, 1990). Here we provide evidence that, in addition to self-control, children’s wait-times are modulated by an implicit, rational decision-making process that considers environmental reliability. We tested children (M = 4;6, N = 28) using a classic paradigm—the marshmallow task (Mischel, 1974)—in an environment demonstrated to be either unreliable or reliable. Children in the reliable condition waited significantly longer than those in the unreliable condition (p &lt; 0.0005), suggesting that children’s wait-times reflected reasoned beliefs about whether waiting would ultimately pay off. Thus, wait-times on sustained delay-of-gratification tasks (e.g., the marshmallow task) may not only reflect differences in self-control abilities, but also beliefs about the stability of the world.</p>

<p>Memory consolidation during infant sleep parallels early stages of lexical development<br />
The duration of sleep stage 2 determines the developmental stage of new infant memories<br />
Local sleep spindles in N2 are involved in the formation of lexical-semantic LTM<br />
Sleep-dependent memory consolidation precedes the normal course of development</p>
<p>From the age of 3 months, infants learn relations between objects and co-occurring words <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/the-desire-to-have-a-child-never-goes-away-how-the-involuntarily-childless-are-forming-a-new-movement"> 1 </a>. These very first representations of object-word pairings in infant memory are considered as non-symbolic proto-words comprising specific visual-auditory associations that can already be formed in the first months of life [ 2–5 ]. Genuine words that refer to semantic long-term memory have not been evidenced prior to 9 months of age [ 6–9 ]. Sleep is known to facilitate the reorganization of memories [ 9–14 ], but its impact on the perceptual-to-semantic trend in early development is unknown. Here we explored the formation of word meanings in 6- to 8-month-old infants and its reorganization during the course of sleep. Infants were exposed to new words as labels for new object categories. In the memory test about an hour later, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In infants who took a short nap during the retention period, a brain response of 3-month-olds <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/the-desire-to-have-a-child-never-goes-away-how-the-involuntarily-childless-are-forming-a-new-movement"> 1 </a> was observed, indicating generalizations based on early developing perceptual-associative memory. In those infants who napped longer, a semantic priming effect [ 15, 16 ] usually found later in development [ 17–19 ] revealed the formation of genuine words. The perceptual-to-semantic shift in memory was related to the duration of sleep stage 2 and to locally increased sleep spindle activity. The finding that, after the massed presentation of several labeled category exemplars, sleep enabled even 6-month-olds to create semantic long-term memory clearly challenges the notion that immature brain structures are responsible for the typically slower lexical development.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple lines of research indicate that fathers often treat boys and girls differently in ways that impact child outcomes. The complex picture that has emerged, however, is obscured by methodological challenges inherent to the study of parental caregiving, and no studies to date have examined the possibility that gender differences in observed real-world paternal behavior are related to differential paternal brain responses to male and female children. Here we compare fathers of daughters and fathers of sons in terms of naturalistically observed everyday caregiving behavior and neural responses to child picture stimuli. Compared with fathers of sons, fathers of daughters were more attentively engaged with their daughters, sang more to their daughters, used more analytical language and language related to sadness and the body with their daughters, and had a stronger neural response to their daughter’s happy facial expressions in areas of the brain important for reward and emotion regulation (medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]). In contrast, fathers of sons engaged in more rough and tumble play (RTP), used more achievement language with their sons, and had a stronger neural response to their son’s neutral facial expressions in the medial OFC (mOFC). Whereas the mOFC response to happy faces was negatively related to RTP, the mOFC response to neutral faces was positively related to RTP, specifically for fathers of boys. These results indicate that real-world paternal behavior and brain function differ as a function of child gender.</li>

<ul>
<li>A population-based pregnancy cohort study including 754 women who enrolled in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy (SELMA) study in pregnancy week 8–13. Two exposure measures were used: (1) maternally reported number of APAP tablets taken between conception and enrollment; (2) APAP urinary concentration at enrollment. Language development at 30 months was assessed by nurse’s evaluation and parental questionnaire, including the number of words the child used (&lt;25, 25–50 and &gt;50). Main study outcome; parental report of use of fewer than 50 words, termed language delay (LD).<br />
Results<br />
59.2% of women enrolled in weeks 8–13 reported taking APAP between conception and enrollment. APAP was measurable in all urine samples and urinary APAP was correlated with the number of APAP taken during pregnancy (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01). Language delay was more prevalent in boys (12.6%) than girls (4.1%) (8.5% in total). Both the number of APAP tablets and urinary APAP concentration were associated with greater LD in girls but not in boys. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for LD among girls whose mothers reported &gt;6 <em>vs.</em> 0 APAP tablets was 5.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–31.94). The OR for LD in girls whose mothers’ urinary APAP was in the highest compared to the lowest quartile was 10.34 (95% CI 1.37–77.86). While it cannot be ruled out, our available data do not support confounding by indication.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Given the prevalence of prenatal APAP use and the importance of language development, these findings, if replicated, would suggest that pregnant women should limit their use of this analgesic during pregnancy.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of the lawlike regularities of psychological science is that of developmental progression—an increase in sensorimotor, cognitive, and social functioning from childhood to adulthood. Here, we report a rare violation of this law, a developmental reversal in attention. In Experiment 1, 4- to 5-year-olds (<em>n</em> = 34) and adults (<em>n</em> = 35) performed a change-detection task that included externally cued and uncued shapes. Whereas the adults outperformed the children on the cued shapes, the children outperformed the adults on the uncued shapes. In Experiment 2, the same participants completed a visual search task, and their memory for search-relevant and search-irrelevant information was tested. The young children outperformed the adults with respect to search-irrelevant features. This demonstration of a paradoxical property of early attention deepens current understanding of the development of attention. It also has implications for understanding early learning and cognitive development more broadly.</li>

<li>rhythm matters</li>
<li>The aim of the present study was to examine how the social norms shared in a classroom environment influence the development of movement dynamics of handwriting of children who participate in the environment. To look into this issue, the following aspects of the entire period of classroom learning of <em>hiragana</em> letters in Japanese 1st graders who had just entered primary school were studied: First, the structure of classroom events and the specific types of interaction and learning within such environment were described. Second, in the experiment involving 6-year-old children who participated in the class, writing movements of children and their changes over the period of <em>hiragana</em> education were analyzed for each stroke composing letters. It was found that writing movement of children became differentiated in a manner specific to the different types of stroke endings, to which children were systematically encouraged to attend in the classroom. The results provide a detailed description of the process of how dynamics of fine motor movement of children is modulated by the social norms of a populated, classroom environment in a non-Latin alphabet writing system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Interoception, the sensitivity to visceral sensations, plays an important role in homeostasis and guiding motivated behaviour. It is also considered to be fundamental to self-awareness. Despite its importance, the developmental origins of interoceptive sensitivity remain unexplored. We here provide the first evidence for implicit, flexible interoceptive sensitivity in 5 month old infants using a novel behavioural measure, coupled with an established cortical index of interoceptive processing. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early developmental stages of self-awareness, self-regulation and socio-emotional abilities.</li>

<p><em>human milk oligosaccharides exhibit antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties against group b streptococcus</em><br />

<ul>
<li><em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> (Group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes invasive infections in both children and adults. During pregnancy, GBS is a significant cause of infection of the fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), which can lead to intra-amniotic infection, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis. Recently, breastfeeding has been thought to represent a potential mode of GBS transmission from mother to newborn, which might increase the risk for late-onset sepsis. Little is known, however, about the molecular components of breast milk that may support or prevent GBS colonization. In this study, we examine how human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) affect the pathogenesis of GBS. HMOs from discrete donor samples were isolated and profiled by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). Growth and biofilm assays show that HMOs from mothers of specific milk groups can modulate the growth and biofilm formation of GBS. High-resolution field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the quantitative biofilm assays and demonstrated cell arrangement perturbations in bacterial cultures treated with specific oligosaccharides. These findings demonstrate that HMOs affect the growth and cell biology of GBS. Finally, this study provides the first example of HMOs functioning as antibiofilm agents against GBS.</li>

<li>a successful guide dog must navigate a complex world, avoid distractions, and respond adaptively to unpredictable events. what leads to success? we followed 98 puppies from birth to adulthood. puppies were enrolled in a training program where only ∼70% achieved success as guide dogs. more intense mothering early in life was associated with program failure. in addition, mothers whose nursing style required greater effort by puppies produced more successful offspring. among young adult dogs, poor problem-solving abilities, perseveration, and apparently greater anxiety when confronted with a novel object were also associated with program failure. results mirror the results from rodents and humans, reaffirming the enduring effects on adult behavior of maternal style and individual differences in temperament and cognition.</li>

<p><em>infants make more attempts to achieve a goal when they see adults persist</em><br />
julia leonard et al. 2017<br />
10.1126/science.aan2317</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistence, above and beyond IQ, is associated with long-term academic outcomes.<br />
To look at the effect of adult models on infants’ persistence, we conducted an experiment in which 15-month-olds were assigned to one of three conditions: an Effort condition in which they saw an adult try repeatedly, using various methods, to achieve each of two different goals; a No Effort condition in which the adult achieved the goals effortlessly; or a Baseline condition. Infants were then given a difficult, novel task. Across an initial study and two preregistered experiments (N = 262), infants in the Effort condition made more attempts to achieve the goal than did infants in the other conditions. Pedagogical cues modulated the effect. The results suggest that adult models causally affect infants’ persistence and that infants can generalize the value of persistence to novel tasks</li>

<p><em>ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such as “force,” “work,” or “effort”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults.</li>

<p><em>practicing for the future: deliberate practice in early childhood</em><br />
melissa brinums et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12938">dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12938</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate practice is essential for acquiring a wide range of skills that have been central to humans’ adaptive success, yet little is known about when and how children develop this capability. The current study examined 4- to 7-year-olds’ (*N *= 120) ability to selectively practice a skill that would be useful in the near future, as well as their broader understanding of the role of deliberate practice in skill acquisition. Six- and 7-year-olds demonstrated both an explicit understanding of deliberate practice and the capacity to practice without being prompted. Five-year-olds showed an understanding of deliberate practice and some capacity to practice, whereas 4-year-olds showed neither of these capabilities. Findings reveal important developments in children’s future-directed behavior beyond the preschool years.</li>
<li>“Our study contributes to our understanding of how young children start to regulate their own learning to achieve their long-term goals, as well as the development of the cognitive processes that allow people to acquire a range of general skills and highly specialized expertise throughout life,” explains Melissa Brinums, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Queensland who led the study. “It is one of only a small number of studies documenting age-related differences in children’s future-oriented behavior beyond the preschool period.”<br />
To learn more about young children’s understanding of practice and the age at which they start to practice without being prompted, researchers tested 120 children ages 4 to 7 years. Most were from European-Australian, middle- to upper-middle-class families — and the authors caution that more study is needed to examine the influence of social factors (including socioeconomic status) and individual differences on children’s understanding of and engagement in deliberate practice.<br />
In the study, children in one room were shown three games involving motor skills and told they would be tested on one of them (a target game) later, winning stickers based on their performance. Children were then brought to a different room with replicas of the games they had seen in the first room and told they had five minutes to play before returning to the first room for the test. The researchers anticipated that children who understood that practice could help their future performance would spend more time playing the target game than the other two games. After playing, children were asked which game they played the longest and why, what they could do to improve on the games, and if they could explain what practice is.<br />
Most 6- and 7-year-olds explained what practice is and knew that it helped improve their skills, and most played the target game longer than the other games and said they did so to practice for the test. Most 5-year-olds showed an understanding of practice and spent slightly longer playing the target game; however, when asked why they had chosen to play that game, the 5-year-olds said they did so for reasons other than practice. Most 4-year-olds did not understand the concept of practice and did not spend more time playing the target game.<br />
Overall, these findings reveal clear improvements in children’s deliberate practice from ages 4 to 7. These increases in understanding of and engagement in deliberate practice may be due to age-related improvements in cognitive capacities such as episodic foresight, metacognition, and executive functions, the researchers suggest. Episodic foresight, the capacity to envision the future, allows children to foresee the future utility of a skill. Metacognition, the capacity to reflect on and monitor mental states, and executive functions, the cognitive processes that allow us to control our thoughts and behavior, play important roles in allowing children to monitor and control their own learning.<br />
“By providing insight into children’s understanding of practice and the age at which they start to practice for the future with and without prompting, our study may help caregivers and teachers structure age-appropriate learning activities for children,” notes Kana Imuta, a psychology researcher at the University of Queensland, who coauthored the study. “For example, out findings suggest that it may be beneficial to start having conversations with children as young as 6 about their future goals, and encourage them to think about and work toward those goals. A focus on the future may help kids understand why practicing is so important.”</li>

<p><em>speaker gaze increases infant-adult connectivity</em><br />

<ul>
<li>When infants and adults communicate, they exchange social signals of availability and communicative intention such as eye gaze. Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers’ and listeners’ neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult-infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (a) Direct gaze (looking forward); (b) Indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20 degrees); or (c) Direct-Oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In Experiment 2 (N=19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with Direct or Indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult-infant neural network connectivity were measured using Partial Directed Coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger)-causal influence on infants’ neural activity, which was stronger during Direct and Direct-Oblique gaze relative to Indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during Direct than Indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalised more frequently during live Direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronisation from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bi-directional adult-infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a joint-networked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.</li>

<p><em>do lessons in nature boost subsequent classroom engagement? refueling students in flight</em><br />
ming kuo et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02253">http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02253</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers wishing to offer lessons in nature may hold back for fear of leaving students keyed up and unable to concentrate in subsequent, indoor lessons. This study tested the hypothesis that lessons in nature have positive—not negative—aftereffects on subsequent classroom engagement. Using carefully matched pairs of lessons (one in a relatively natural outdoor setting and one indoors), we observed subsequent classroom engagement during an indoor instructional period, replicating these comparisons over 10 different topics and weeks in the school year, in each of two third grade classrooms. Pairs were roughly balanced in how often the outdoor lesson preceded or followed the classroom lesson. Classroom engagement was significantly better after lessons in nature than after their matched counterparts for four of the five measures developed for this study: teacher ratings; third-party tallies of “redirects” (the number of times the teacher stopped instruction to direct student attention back onto the task at hand); independent, photo-based ratings made blind to condition; and a composite index each showed a nature advantage; student ratings did not. This nature advantage held across different teachers and held equally over the initial and final 5 weeks of lessons. And the magnitude of the advantage was large. In 48 out of 100 paired comparisons, the nature lesson was a full standard deviation better than its classroom counterpart; in 20 of the 48, the nature lesson was over two standard deviations better. The rate of “redirects” was cut almost in half after a lesson in nature, allowing teachers to teach for longer periods uninterrupted. Because the pairs of lessons were matched on teacher, class (students and classroom), topic, teaching style, week of the semester, and time of day, the advantage of the nature-based lessons could not be attributed to any of these factors. It appears that, far from leaving students too keyed up to concentrate afterward, lessons in nature may actually leave students more able to engage in the next lesson, even as students are also learning the material at hand. Such “refueling in flight” argues for including more lessons in nature in formal education.</li>

<li>hand operated breast pumps
<ul>
<li>buy four so you can rotate washing cycles, for example wash batch of pumps after every fourth pump, placing production of fourth pumping in separate non–pumping botte for feeding so that last pumping bottle can be washed together with rest of pumps</li>

<li>continue bottle feeding stimulus
<ul>
<li>if sleeping in carry pouch, change position from sitting upright to leaning forward so baby changes position from upright to almost horizontal. this change in position seems to trigger new bout of sucking of bottle</li>
<li>if awake, after feeding tails off simply wait ten seconds and offer bottle again</li>

<li>by being too unreliable, abusive parents force a child to fend for themselves, or die trying. conversely, parents who are too coddling, anticipating a child’s every need, stunt the child’s ability by educing the practice they need in order to fend for themselves.</li>

<li>early each day / to the steps of saint paul’s<br />
the little old bird woman comes<br />
in her own special way / to the people she calls<br />
come / buy my bags / full of crumbs<br />
come feed the little birds<br />
show them you care<br />
and you’ll be glad if you do<br />
their young ones are hungry<br />
their nests are so bare<br />
all it takes / is tuppence from you<br />
　<br />
feed the birds / tuppence a bag<br />
tuppence / tuppence / tuppence a bag<br />
feed the birds / that’s what she cries<br />
while overhead / her birds fill the skies<br />
　<br />
all around / the cathedral / the saints and apostles<br />
look down / as she sells her wares<br />
although you can’t see it<br />
you know / they are smiling<br />
each time / someone shows / that he cares<br />
　<br />
though her words / are simple and few<br />
listen / listen / she’s calling to you<br />
feed the birds / tuppence a bag<br />
tuppence / tuppence / tuppence a bag</li>

<li>i see trees of green / red roses too<br />
i see them bloom / for me and you<br />
and i think to myself / what a wonderful world<br />
　<br />
i see skies of blue / and clouds of white<br />
the bright blessed day / the dark sacred night<br />
and i think to myself / what a wonderful world<br />
　<br />
the colours of the rainbow / so pretty in the sky<br />
are also on the faces / of people going by<br />
i see friends / shaking hands / saying “how do you do?”<br />
they’re really saying / i love you<br />
　<br />
i hear babies cry / i watch them grow<br />
they’ll learn much more / than i’ll ever know<br />
and i think to myself / what a wonderful world<br />
　<br />
yes / i think to myself / what a wonderful world<br />
oh / yeah</li>

<li>feed powdered/dissolved formula at a slight angle to the horizontal, say 45 degrees, this allows any undissolved particles to accumulate away from the teat end, so that it does not become clogged</li>

<li>feed pumped breastmilk or formula at a slight angle towards the roof of the mouth, say 30 degrees, this allows the teat end to be in the roof of the mouth where suction and tongue can work well</li>

<li>for early morning wake-ups, (illness, travel etc) if you have a room available to yourself and the baby, then paradoxically “sleep-time” television programmes such as ‘in the night garden” can be helpful at quarter volume as they are more calming. if it is so early that i need to not have my eyes open, i put earmuffs on and use touch to keep track of what baby is doing. right now at age one baby is more into twirliwoos than night garden</li>
