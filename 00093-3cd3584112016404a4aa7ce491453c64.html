<p><em>adaptation of a chytrid parasite to its cyanobacterial host is hampered by host intraspecific diversity</em><br />
ramsy agha et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00921">http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00921</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental evolution can be used to test for and characterize parasite and pathogen adaptation. We undertook a serial-passage experiment in which a single parasite population of the obligate fungal (chytrid) parasite <em>Rhizophydium megarrhizum</em> was maintained over a period of 200 days under different mono- and multiclonal compositions of its phytoplankton host, the bloom-forming cyanobacterium <em>Planktothrix</em>. Despite initially inferior performance, parasite populations under sustained exposure to novel monoclonal hosts experienced rapid fitness increases evidenced by increased transmission rates. This demonstrates rapid adaptation of chytrids to novel hosts and highlights their high evolutionary potential. In contrast, increased fitness was not detected in parasites exposed to multiclonal host mixtures, indicating that cyanobacterial intraspecific diversity hampers parasites adaptation. Significant increases in intensity of infection were observed in monoclonal and multiclonal treatments, suggesting high evolvability of traits involved in parasite attachment onto hosts (i.e., encystment). A comparison of the performance of evolved and unevolved (control) parasite populations against their common ancestral host did not reveal parasite attenuation. Our results exemplify the ability of chytrid parasites to adapt rapidly to new hosts, while providing experimental evidence that genetic diversity in host populations grants increased resistance to disease by hindering parasite adaptation.</li>

<p><em>functional reduction in pollination through herbivore-induced pollinator limitation and its potential in mutualist communities</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Plant–pollinator interactions are complex because they are affected by both interactors’ phenotypes and external variables. Herbivory is one external variable that can have divergent effects on the individual and the population levels depending on specific phenotypic plastic responses of a plant to herbivory. In the wild tomato, <em>Solanum peruvianum</em>, herbivory limits pollinator visits, which reduces individual plant fitness due to herbivore-induced chemical defenses and signaling on pollinators (herbivore-induced pollinator limitation). We showed these herbivory-induced decreases in pollination to individual plants best match a Type II functional-response curve. We then developed a general model that shows these individual fitness reductions from herbivore-induced changes in plant metabolism can indirectly benefit overall populations and community resilience. These results introduce mechanisms of persistence in antagonized mutualistic communities that were previously found prone to extinction in theoretical models. Results also imply that emergent ecological dynamics of individual fitness reductions may be more complex than previously thought.</li>

<p><em>flowering phenology shifts in response to biodiversity loss</em><br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>Advanced spring flowering has been described as a fingerprint of climate change—a public, visible display of the detrimental effects of global warming. However, warming experiments fail to account for the full magnitude of observed changes in phenology, suggesting that other factors may play important roles. We show that peak flowering time shifts earlier for most species when we experimentally reduce plant diversity. Additionally, peak flowering times of plant species are more evenly distributed across the season in high-diversity plots. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of biotic interactions in influencing flowering times and indicate that advancing phenology, one of the most well-described and well-publicized phenomena linking global warming to plant communities, may result equally from biodiversity declines.</p>
<p>Observational studies and experimental evidence agree that rising global temperatures have altered plant phenology—the timing of life events, such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity, with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures.</p>

Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref8">10</a>, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref9">11</a>, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential.</li>

<p><em>a systematic review of ecological attributes that confer resilience to climate change in environmental restoration</em><br />

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173812">dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173812</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual- (9), population- (6), community- (7), ecosystem- (7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species- or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.</li>

<p><em>contrasting responses of functional diversity to major losses in taxonomic diversity</em><br />

<p>Global biodiversity consists not only of the sum of taxonomic units such as species, but also of their ecological or functional variety. These two components of biodiversity might be expected to rise or fall in tandem, but we find they are capable of strikingly independent behavior. In three major declines in taxonomic diversity—spatially from equator to poles today and temporally in the Permian–Triassic and Cretaceous–Paleogene extinctions—only the first one shows a concomitant drop in the number of functional groups, whereas virtually all functional categories survived the extinction events. We present a conceptual framework for understanding this contrast, and we suggest that the differing behavior of these two biodiversity components will be important in anticipating the impacts of impending losses in today’s biota.</p>
<p>Taxonomic diversity of benthic marine invertebrate shelf species declines at present by nearly an order of magnitude from the tropics to the poles in each hemisphere along the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), most steeply along the western Pacific where shallow-sea diversity is at its tropical maximum. In the Bivalvia, a model system for macroevolution and macroecology, this taxonomic trend is accompanied by a decline in the number of functional groups and an increase in the evenness of taxa distributed among those groups, with maximum functional evenness (FE) in polar waters of both hemispheres. In contrast, analyses of this model system across the two era-defining events of the Phanerozoic, the Permian–Triassic and Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinctions, show only minor declines in functional richness despite high extinction intensities, resulting in a rise in FE owing to the persistence of functional groups. We hypothesize that the spatial decline of taxonomic diversity and increase in FE along the present-day LDG primarily reflect diversity-dependent factors, whereas retention of almost all functional groups through the two mass extinctions suggests the operation of diversity-independent factors. Comparative analyses of different aspects of biodiversity thus reveal strongly contrasting biological consequences of similarly severe declines in taxonomic diversity and can help predict the consequences for functional diversity among different drivers of past, present, and future biodiversity loss.</p>

<p><em>uplift-driven diversification in the hengduan mountains, a temperate biodiversity hotspot</em><br />
yaowu xinga, richard h. ree 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1616063114">dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1616063114</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why do so many species occur in mountains? A popular but little-tested hypothesis is that tectonic uplift creates environmental conditions (new habitats, dispersal barriers, etc.) that increase the rate at which resident species divide and evolve to form new ones. In China’s Hengduan Mountains region, a biodiversity hotspot uplifted over the last 8 million years, this rate does in fact show a significant increase during that time, relative to the rate for adjacent older mountains, and to the rate of species immigration. The Hengduan Mountains flora is thus made up disproportionately of species that evolved within the region during its uplift, supporting the original hypothesis and helping to explain the prevalence of mountains as global biodiversity hotspots.</p>
<p>A common hypothesis for the rich biodiversity found in mountains is uplift-driven diversification—that orogeny creates conditions favoring rapid in situ speciation of resident lineages. We tested this hypothesis in the context of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjoining mountain ranges, using the phylogenetic and geographic histories of multiple groups of plants to infer the tempo (rate) and mode (colonization versus in situ diversification) of biotic assembly through time and across regions. We focused on the Hengduan Mountains region, which in comparison with the QTP and Himalayas was uplifted more recently (since the late Miocene) and is smaller in area and richer in species. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses show that about 8 million y ago the rate of in situ diversification increased in the Hengduan Mountains, significantly exceeding that in the geologically older QTP and Himalayas. By contrast, in the QTP and Himalayas during the same period the rate of in situ diversification remained relatively flat, with colonization dominating lineage accumulation. The Hengduan Mountains flora was thus assembled disproportionately by recent in situ diversification, temporally congruent with independent estimates of orogeny. This study shows quantitative evidence for uplift-driven diversification in this region, and more generally, tests the hypothesis by comparing the rate and mode of biotic assembly jointly across time and space. It thus complements the more prevalent method of examining endemic radiations individually and could be used as a template to augment such studies in other biodiversity hotspots.</p>

<p><em>polygamy slows down population divergence in shorebirds</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Sexual selection may act as a promotor of speciation since divergent mate choice and competition for mates can rapidly lead to reproductive isolation. Alternatively, sexual selection may also retard speciation since polygamous individuals can access additional mates by increased breeding dispersal. High breeding dispersal should hence increase gene flow and reduce diversification in polygamous species. Here, we test how polygamy predicts diversification in shorebirds using genetic differentiation and subspecies richness as proxies for population divergence. Examining microsatellite data from 79 populations in 10 plover species (Genus: <em>Charadrius</em>) we found that polygamous species display significantly less genetic structure and weaker isolation-by-distance effects than monogamous species. Consistent with this result, a comparative analysis including 136 shorebird species showed significantly fewer subspecies for polygamous than for monogamous species. By contrast, migratory behavior neither predicted genetic differentiation nor subspecies richness. Taken together, our results suggest that dispersal associated with polygamy may facilitate gene flow and limit population divergence. Therefore, intense sexual selection, as occurs in polygamous species, may act as a brake rather than an engine of speciation in shorebirds. We discuss alternative explanations for these results and call for further studies to understand the relationships between sexual selection, dispersal, and diversification.</li>

<p>In <em>Antifragile</em>, Nassim Taleb makes a point about complex systems. He says that to thrive they <em>need</em> variety and novelty. For a complex system, randomness is a <em>necessity</em>.<br />
This applies to the human body, a gloriously complex system. Muscles need a range of stimulation that varies in frequency, intensity and duration to be at their most strong and supple. Joints need to be moved through multiple planes under a variety of loads to retain their stability and mobility. The cardiovascular systems needs to be challenged and tested to be at its most effective. All this needs to be done, but not in an organised way. The human body needs random variety, not regimented variety.</p>

<li>Large-scale deletions and duplications of genes, referred to as structural variants (SVs), are common within the human genome and have been linked to disease. Examining a genomic region that appears to confer a selective benefit, Leffler <em>et al.</em> used fine mapping to identify a specific SV that reduces the risk of severe malaria by an estimated 40% (see the Perspective by Winzeler). Data from African individuals revealed that populations harbor different SVs in this region. Furthermore, by dissecting a highly complex genomic region, the authors identified the likely causal element. This element encodes hybrid genes that affect glycophorin proteins, which are used by the malarial parasite in infection and are associated with resistance to severe disease.</li>
<li>The malaria parasite <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> invades human red blood cells via interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. By analyzing genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a diverse array of large copy number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes <em>GYPA</em> and <em>GYPB</em>. We find that a nearby association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural rearrangement involving the loss of <em>GYPB</em> and gain of two <em>GYPB-A</em> hybrid genes, which encode a serologically distinct blood group antigen known as Dantu. This variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently risen in frequency in parts of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These findings link structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors with natural resistance to severe malaria.</li>

<p>Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a cause of individual differences in responses to medications and is an underappreciated burden on public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of μ-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, improving patients’ quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal burden due to variable drug responsiveness.</p>

<li>Fundamental ecological processes, such as extrinsic mortality, determine population age structure. This influences disease spread when individuals of different ages differ in susceptibility or when maternal age determines offspring susceptibility. We show that <em>Daphnia magna</em> offspring born to young mothers are more susceptible than those born to older mothers, and consider this alongside previous observations that susceptibility declines with age in this system. We used a susceptible-infected compartmental model to investigate how age-specific susceptibility and maternal age effects on offspring susceptibility interact with demographic factors affecting disease spread. Our results show a scenario where an increase in extrinsic mortality drives an increase in transmission potential. Thus, we identify a realistic context in which age effects and maternal effects produce conditions favouring disease transmission.</li>

<li>When one child goes to school with a throat infection, many of his or her classmates will often start to come down with a sore throat after two or three days. A few of the children will get sick sooner, the very next day, while others may take about a week. As such, there is a distribution of incubation periods – the time from exposure to illness – across the children in the class.<br />
When plotted on a graph, the distribution of incubation periods is not the normal bell curve. Rather the curve looks lopsided, with a long tail on the right. Plotting the logarithms of the incubation periods, however, rather than the incubation periods themselves, does give a normal distribution. As such, statisticians refer to this kind of curve as a “lognormal distribution”. Remarkably, many other, completely unrelated, diseases – like typhoid fever or bladder cancer – also have approximately lognormal distributions of incubation periods. This raised the question: why do such different diseases show such a similar curve?<br />
Working with a simple mathematical model in which chance plays a key role, Ottino-Löffler et al. calculate how long it takes for a bacterial infection or cancer cell to take over a network of healthy cells. The model explains why a lognormal-like distribution of incubation periods, modeled as takeover times, is so ubiquitous. It emerges from the random dynamics of the incubation process itself, as the disease-causing microbe or mutant cancer cell competes with the cells of the host.<br />
Intuitively, this new analysis builds on insights from the “coupon collector’s problem”: a classical problem in mathematics that describes the situation where a person collects items like baseball cards, stamps, or cartoon monsters in a videogame. If a random item arrives every day, and the collector’s luck is bad, they may have to wait a long time to collect those last few items. Similarly, in the model of Ottino-Löffler et al., the takeover time is dominated by dramatic slowdowns near the start or end of the infection process. These effects lead to an approximately lognormal distribution, with long waits, as seen in so many diseases.<br />
Ottino-Löffler et al. do not anticipate that their findings will have direct benefits for medicine or public health. Instead, they believe their results could help to advance basic research in the fields of epidemiology, evolutionary biology and cancer research. The findings might also make an impact outside biology. The term “contagion” has now become a familiar metaphor for the spread of everything from computer viruses to bank failures. This model sheds light on how long it takes for a contagion to take over a network, for a variety of idealized networks and spreading processes.</li>

<li>Natural ecosystems are shaped along two fundamental axes, space and time, but how biodiversity is partitioned along both axes is not well understood. Here, we show that the relationship between temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns can vary predictably according to habitat characteristics. By quantifying seasonal and annual changes in larval dragonfly communities across a natural predation gradient we demonstrate that variation in the identity of top predator species is associated with systematic differences in spatio-temporal β-diversity patterns, leading to consistent differences in relative partitioning of biodiversity between time and space across habitats. As the size of top predators increased (from invertebrates to fish) habitats showed lower species turnover across sites and years, but relatively larger seasonal turnover within a site, which ultimately shifted the relative partitioning of biodiversity across time and space. These results extend community assembly theory by identifying common mechanisms that link spatial and temporal patterns of β*-*diversity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Coral reefs are among Earth’s best-studied ecosystems, yet the degree to which large predators influence the ecology of coral reefs remains an open and contentious question. Recent studies indicate the consumptive effects of large reef predators are too diffuse to elicit trophic cascades. Here, we provide evidence that such predators can produce non-consumptive (fear) effects that flow through herbivores to shape the distribution of seaweed on a coral reef. This trophic cascade emerged because reef topography, tidal oscillations, and shark hunting behaviour interact to create predictable “hot spots” of fear on the reef where herbivores withhold feeding and seaweeds gain a spatial refuge. Thus, in risky habitats, sharks can exert strong ecological impacts even though they are trophic generalists that rarely feed. These findings contextualize the debate over whether predators influence coral reef structure and function and move us to ask not if, but under what specific conditions, they generate trophic cascades.</li>

<p>Culture is typically viewed as consisting of traits inherited epigenetically, through social learning. However, cultural diversity has species-typical constraints<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref1">25</a>, presumably of genetic origin. A celebrated, if contentious, example is whether a universal grammar constrains syntactic diversity in human languages<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref2">26</a>. Oscine songbirds exhibit song learning and provide biologically tractable models of culture: members of a species show individual variation in song<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref3">27</a> and geographically separated groups have local song dialects<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref4">28</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref5">29</a>.

Without such constraints, innovations and copying errors should cause unbounded variation over multiple generations or geographical distance, contrary to observations<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref9">33</a>. Here we report an experiment designed to determine whether wild-type song culture might emerge over multiple generations in an isolated colony founded by isolates, and, if so, how this might happen and what type of social environment is required<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref10">34</a>. Zebra finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in laboratory<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref11">35</a> or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations in two social environments: tutor–pupil pairs in sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations. Thus, species-typical song culture can appear <em>de novo</em>. Our study has parallels with language change and evolution<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref12">36</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref13">37</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07994#ref14">38</a>.

<p><em>crowd vocal learning induces vocal dialects in bats: playback of conspecifics shapes fundamental frequency usage by pups</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Vocal learning, the substrate of human language acquisition, has rarely been described in other mammals. Often, group-specific vocal dialects in wild populations provide the main evidence for vocal learning. While social learning is often the most plausible explanation for these intergroup differences, it is usually impossible to exclude other driving factors, such as genetic or ecological backgrounds. Here, we show the formation of dialects through social vocal learning in fruit bats under controlled conditions. We raised 3 groups of pups in conditions mimicking their natural roosts. Namely, pups could hear their mothers’ vocalizations but were also exposed to a manipulation playback. The vocalizations in the 3 playbacks mainly differed in their fundamental frequency. From the age of approximately 6 months and onwards, the pups demonstrated distinct dialects, where each group was biased towards its playback. We demonstrate the emergence of dialects through social learning in a mammalian model in a tightly controlled environment. Unlike in the extensively studied case of songbirds where specific tutors are imitated, we demonstrate that bats do not only learn their vocalizations directly from their mothers, but that they are actually influenced by the sounds of the entire crowd. This process, which we term “crowd vocal learning,” might be relevant to many other social animals such as cetaceans and pinnipeds.<br />
Author summary<br />
The spontaneous acquisition of speech by human infants is considered a keystone of human language, but the ability to reproduce vocalizations acquired by hearing is not commonly described in other mammals. This skill, termed vocal learning, is challenging to study in nonhuman animals since such investigation requires the detection and exclusion of innate developmental effects. The recognition of vocal dialects among different populations can open a window on the vocal learning abilities of animals, but such findings in the wild may reflect genetic or ecological differences between groups rather than the learning of group-specific vocal behavior. In this study, we used a playback-based lab experiment to induce vocal dialects in fruit bat pups. By exposing groups of pups to different playbacks of conspecific calls, we could establish separate dialects, demonstrating the vocal learning skill of these bats. Furthermore, while songbirds, for instance, learn their songs directly from a specific tutor, our bats showed the ability to pick up vocal variations from the surrounding crowd, without direct interaction with any given tutor.</li>

<li>“fragmentation is the key to stable cooperation,” can vural said. “if groups manage to fragment more often than mutants appear, then cooperation will prevail. it’s a bit like starting a new forest before the fire catches on.”</li>
<li>How producers of public goods persist in microbial communities is a major question in evolutionary biology. Cooperation is evolutionarily unstable, since cheating strains can reproduce quicker and take over. Spatial structure has been shown to be a robust mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Here we study how spatial assortment might emerge from native dynamics and show that fluid flow shear promotes cooperative behavior. Social structures arise naturally from our advection-diffusion-reaction model as self-reproducing Turing patterns. We computationally study the effects of fluid advection on these patterns as a mechanism to enable or enhance social behavior. Our central finding is that flow shear enables and promotes social behavior in microbes by increasing the group fragmentation rate and thereby limiting the spread of cheating strains. Regions of the flow domain with higher shear admit high cooperativity and large population density, whereas low shear regions are devoid of life due to opportunistic mutations.</li>

<li>Neurons act together to encode information such as the nature of a sensory stimulus. The number of neurons used for individual stimuli and the nature of the encoding used are not well understood. Higher sensory areas have been observed to respond sparsely to sensory stimuli, meaning that only a relatively small number of neurons fire action potentials (or “spikes”) when any particular stimulus is present. Sparse spiking activity is present in primary auditory cortex but only after a sound has been playing for some period of time. Dense spiking, however, is present at stimulus onset. We found that each action potential in primary auditory cortex contributed approximately the same amount of information about a tone stimulus, which resulted in more accurate encoding from the dense onset spiking. The later sparse spiking retained stimulus information but required a longer time to read it out. This arrangement allows sensory stimuli to be identified rapidly yet represented efficiently for extended periods, while neurons still retain sensitivity to novel stimuli. Dense and sparse coding may therefore work together dynamically in order to represent complex, temporally overlapping sensory content.</li>

<p><em>biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in a 15-year grassland experiment: patterns, mechanisms, and open questions</em><br />
wolfgang w. weisser et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research.<br />
First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the ‘main experiment’, where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/plant-community">plant communities</a> experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity–stability theory.<br />
Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness.<br />
Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances.<br />
Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nitrogen-cycle">N cycle</a> responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle.<br />
Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions.<br />
Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-carbon">soil carbon</a> storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/invertebrate">invertebrates</a>, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes.<br />
Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/energy-crops">energy crops</a>. These results suggest that diverse ‘High Nature Value Grasslands’ are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services.<br />
A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/monoculture">monoculture</a> performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.<br />
To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/complementarity-molecular-biology">complementarity</a> in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.</p>

<li>Genetic diversity is considered an important factor, stabilizing ecological functions when organisms are faced with changing environmental conditions. Although well known from terrestrial systems, documentations of this relationship from marine organisms, and particularly planktonic microorganisms, are still limited. Here we experimentally tested the effects of genotypic diversity on ecologically relevant cellular parameters (growth, primary production, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, particulate organic phosphorus and biogenic silica) at optimal and suboptimal salinity conditions in a marine phytoplankton species. Multiple clonal genotyped and phenotypically characterized isolates of the diatom <em>Skeletonema marinoi</em> from the Baltic Sea were grown in monocultures and mixes of 5 and 20 clones at native (5 psu) and reduced (3 psu) salinities and respective parameters were compared. Re-genotyping of 30 individuals from each population at five microsatellite loci at the end of the experiment confirmed maintenance of genotypic richness. Although a diversity effect on growth was not detected, primary production and particulate organic nutrients were positively affected by increased diversity independent of salinity condition. Under salinity stress, highest values of primary production and particulate organic nitrogen content were measured at the high diversity level. The observed diversity effects emphasize the importance of genetic diversity of phytoplankton populations for ecological functions.</li>

<li>Biodiversity is an essential determinant of ecosystem functioning. Numerous studies described positive effects of diversity on the functioning of communities arising from complementary resource use and facilitation. However, high biodiversity may also increase competitive interactions, fostering antagonism and negatively affecting community performance. Using experimental bacterial communities we differentiated diversity effects based on genotypic richness and dissimilarity. We show that these diversity characteristics have opposite effects on ecosystem functioning. Genotypic dissimilarity governed complementary resource use, improving ecosystem functioning in complex resource environments. Contrastingly, genotypic richness drove allelopathic interactions, mostly reducing ecosystem functioning. The net biodiversity effect on community performance resulted from the interplay between the genetic structure of the community and resource complexity. These results demonstrate that increasing richness, without concomitantly increasing dissimilarity, can decrease ecosystem functioning in simple environments due to antagonistic interactions, an effect insufficiently considered so far in mechanistic models of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship.</li>

<li>There is a growing awareness that biodiversity not only drives ecosystem services but also affects evolutionary dynamics. However, different theories predict contrasting outcomes on when do evolutionary processes occur within a context of competition. We tested whether functional diversity can explain diversification patterns. We tracked the survival and diversification of a focal bacterial species (<em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>) growing in bacterial communities of variable diversity and composition. We found that high functional diversity reduced the fitness of the focal species and, at the same time, fostered its diversification. This pattern was linked to resource competition: High diversity increased competition on a portion of the resources while leaving most underexploited. The evolved phenotypes of the focal species showed a better use of underexploited resources, albeit at a cost of lower overall growth rates. As a result, diversification alleviated the impact of competition on the fitness of the focal species. We conclude that biodiversity can stimulate evolutionary diversification, provided that sufficient alternative niches are available.</li>

<li>Diversity is a fundamental, yet threatened, property of ecological systems. The idea that diversity can itself favour diversification, in an autocatalytic process, is very appealing but remains controversial. Here, we study a generalized model of ecological communities and investigate how the level of initial diversity influences the possibility of evolutionary diversification. We show that even simple models of intra- and inter-specific ecological interactions can predict a positive effect of diversity on diversification: adaptive radiations may require a threshold number of species before kicking-off. We call this phenomenon DDAR (diversity-dependent adaptive radiations) and identify mathematically two distinct pathways connecting diversity to diversification, involving character displacement and the positive diversity-productivity relationship. Our results may explain observed delays in adaptive radiations at the macroscale and diversification patterns reported in experimental microbial communities, and shed new light on the dynamics of ecological diversity, the diversity-dependence of diversification rates, and the consequences of biodiversity loss.</li>

<p><em>niche tradeoffs, neutrality, and community structure: a stochastic theory of resource competition, invasion, and community assembly</em><br />
david tilman 2004<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403458101">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403458101</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide “slices” of the habitat’s spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity <em>per se</em>, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.<br />
Both tradeoff-based theories of interspecific competition (1–10) and neutral theories (11–13) have been suggested as potential explanations for the assembly, dynamics, and structure of ecological communities. Both approaches have provided insights, and both have shortcomings (11, 14–20). For instance, tradeoff-based theories of resource competition predict patterns of species traits and species separation on nutrient gradients similar to those observed (4, 5, 8–10, 21–24). These theories also provide a potential explanation for the high diversity of nature, predicting that habitat heterogeneity can allow a potentially unlimited number of species to coexist if species that are better at dealing with one environmental constraint are necessarily worse at dealing with another (4, 8, 9, 25). Classical tradeoff-based theories, however, do not predict a limit to diversity, because each point on a tradeoff surface represents traits of a species that could potentially invade into and coexist with any other species from that tradeoff surface (4, 5, 8–10, 26). This feature also means that classical tradeoff theory does not provide a general explanation for species relative abundances (11).<br />
Neutral theory assumes that species are ecologically equivalent in their responses to all constraints and thus have no interspecific tradeoffs (11–13); it predicts that high species diversity could result from a balance between speciation and stochastic extinction caused by random drifts in population size (11). The stochastic drift of neutral theory is the basis for an elegantly simple analytical explanation for species relative abundance patterns (11). However, neutral theory predicts, contrary to numerous observations (e.g., refs. 4, 5, 14–21, and 22–24), that there should be no relation among species traits and their abundances or among community composition and environmental conditions. According to neutral theory, species are rare or abundant not because of their traits and the traits of their competitors but rather solely because of stochastic drift in densities of competitively identical species (11).<br />
In this article, I develop stochastic niche theory, which modifies competitive tradeoff theory by including stochastic processes, such as those that underlie neutral theory. The historical roots of this theory lie in the work of MacArthur, May, Turelli, and others (27–31) on competition and limiting similarity. Stochastic niche theory offers an explanation for diversity, species composition, relative species abundance patterns, and invasion dynamics in ecological communities that resolves many of the shortcomings of both classical tradeoff theory and neutral theory.<br />
Three observations form the heart of stochastic niche theory. First, community assembly results from the success or failure of propagules of invaders that, because of their rarity, are potentially subject to loss by means of demographic stochasticity. Second, successful propagules must be able to grow immensely in biomass and survive long enough to become reproductively successful adults while using the resources left unconsumed by established species. Third, the probability of successful establishment should depend on the resource requirements of an invader relative to those of established species, i.e., on how different an invader is from established species. Note that I call any species that enters a habitat in which it does not currently exist an “invader” or “invading species” whether or not it is a member of the regional flora or fauna or from a different biogeographic realm.</li>

<p>tilman 2004 holds parallels for our diversity: do certain forms take more resources (attention etc) than others, and thus act to suppress other forms? “the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity <em>per se</em>, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly”</p>

<li>Deleterious mutations in different copies of a duplicated gene pair have the potential to cause hybrid incompatibility between diverging subpopulations, contributing to reproductive isolation and speciation. This study demonstrates a case of epigenetic gene silencing rather than pseudogene creation by mutation, contributing to a lethal gene combination on hybridization of two ecotypes of <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. Our findings provide direct evidence that naturally occurring epigenetic variation can contribute to incompatible hybrid genotypes, reducing gene flow between subtypes of the same species.<br />
Abstract<br />
Hybrid incompatibility resulting from deleterious gene combinations is thought to be an important step toward reproductive isolation and speciation. Here, we demonstrate involvement of a silent epiallele in hybrid incompatibility. In <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> accession Cvi-0, one of the two copies of a duplicated histidine biosynthesis gene, <em>HISN6A</em>, is mutated, making <em>HISN6B</em> essential. In contrast, in accession Col-0, <em>HISN6A</em> is essential because <em>HISN6B</em> is not expressed. Owing to these differences, Cvi-0 × Col-0 hybrid progeny that are homozygous for both Cvi-0 <em>HISN6A</em> and Col-0 <em>HISN6B</em> do not survive. We show that <em>HISN6B</em> of Col-0 is not a defective pseudogene, but a stably silenced epiallele. Mutating <em>HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6</em> (<em>HDA6</em>), or the cytosine methyltransferase genes <em>MET1</em> or <em>CMT3,</em> erases <em>HISN6B’s</em> silent locus identity, reanimating the gene to circumvent <em>hisn6a</em> lethality and hybrid incompatibility. These results show that <em>HISN6</em>-dependent hybrid lethality is a revertible epigenetic phenomenon and provide additional evidence that epigenetic variation has the potential to limit gene flow between diverging populations of a species.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rarity is a population characteristic that is usually associated with a high risk of extinction. We argue here, however, that chronically rare species (those with low population densities over many generations across their entire ranges) may have individual-level traits that make populations more resistant to extinction. The major obstacle to persistence at low density is successful fertilisa- tion (union between egg and sperm), and chronically rare species are more likely to survive when (1) fertilisation occurs inside or close to an adult, (2) mate choice involves long-distance signals, (3) adults or their surrogate gamete dispersers are highly mobile, or (4) the two sexes are com- bined in a single individual. In contrast, external fertilisation and wind- or water-driven passive dispersal of gametes, or sluggish or sedentary adult life habits in the absence of gamete vectors, appear to be incompatible with sustained rarity. We suggest that the documented increase in fre- quency of these traits among marine genera over geological time could explain observed secular decreases in rates of background extinction. Unanswered questions remain about how common chronic rarity actually is, which traits are consistently associated with chronic rarity, and how chronically rare species are distributed among taxa, and among the world’s ecosystems and regions.</li>

<ul>
<li>rare species are more likely to go extinct first, before more dominant species do, yet there is increasing evidence that rare species also affect ecosystem functioning, perhaps disproportionally to their abundance (soliveres et al. 2016).</li>
<li>Species diversity promotes the delivery of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, the relative functional importance of rare and common species in driving the biodiversity–multifunctionality relationship remains unknown. We studied the relationship between the diversity of rare and common species (according to their local abundances and across nine different trophic groups), and multifunctionality indices derived from 14 ecosystem functions on 150 grasslands across a land-use intensity (LUI) gradient. The diversity of above- and below-ground rare species had opposite effects, with rare above-ground species being associated with high levels of multifunctionality, probably because their effects on different functions did not trade off against each other. Conversely, common species were only related to average, not high, levels of multifunctionality, and their functional effects declined with LUI. Apart from the community-level effects of diversity, we found significant positive associations between the abundance of individual species and multifunctionality in 6% of the species tested. Species-specific functional effects were best predicted by their response to LUI: species that declined in abundance with land use intensification were those associated with higher levels of multifunctionality. Our results highlight the importance of rare species for ecosystem multifunctionality and help guiding future conservation priorities.</li>
<li>the ability of ecosystems to maintain a large number of functions at average levels (50% threshold) is mainly driven by the diversity of common species and, intuitively, by the prevailing environmental conditions (as shown by the significant interactions found in our models). However, the delivery of a smaller number of functions, but at very high levels (75 and 90% thresholds), was mainly related to the multidiversity of rare species. The level of multifunctionality required will depend on stakeholder preferences, but the performance of many functions at their highest potential (high multifunctionality values at high thresholds) can be generally interpreted as a more desirable state of natural ecosystems. Overall, our study shows that the diversity of rare species is consistently and positively related to multifunctionality at the highest levels, thus implying the existence of ‘win-win’ scenarios between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision.</li>
<li>A high diversity of rare species might be more beneficial for multifunctionality than a high diversity of common species if rare species are less likely to negatively affect ecosystem functions. We found that functional trade-offs between species, where some species have positive effects on multifunctionality and others negative effects, were less common among rare than among common species (<strong>figure 3</strong>). This could explain the stronger positive effect of rare species diversity on multifunctionality. Our correlative study does not allow us to investigate the mechanisms behind the lower incidence of such functional trade-offs in rare species. However, we speculate that if functional effects are driven by the presence of a given species, rather than by its abundance, they are much less likely to be negative. In the case of the presence-based functional effects, the species is either there and promotes a given function, or is absent and has no effect. For example, the presence of certain species can promote recreational services such as birdwatching [<strong>20</strong>], or prevent plant invasions [<strong>18</strong>,<strong>19</strong>]). Such presence-based effects are likely to be the dominant ones among rare species. By contrast, functional effects that are proportional to a species’ abundance [<strong>6</strong>] may also be negative. Abundant species can reduce, rather than promote, a given function, e.g. species with low specific leaf area can reduce rates of nutrient cycling. Common species are more likely than rare species to have such abundance-related effects. Therefore, even if the common species are functionally relevant, they may have opposing functional effects (e.g. the positive effects of a common productive plant on forage production might be balanced by negative effects of a common herbivorous insect that feeds upon it). Such strong functional trade-offs between common species could therefore result in a small effect of common species diversity on multifunctionality and a greater importance of rare species diversity in promoting multifunctionality. A complementary explanation for the higher functional importance of rare species is that they tend to be less redundant than common species in the functional traits they possess and, therefore, support communities with more distinct combinations of functional traits [<strong>52</strong>]. This enhanced functional diversity could also explain the positive functional effect of the multidiversity of rare species, as functional diversity is related to the provision and stability of multiple ecosystem functions [<strong>53</strong>,<strong>54</strong>].</li>

<li>Understanding why some species are rare while others are common remains a central and fascinating question in ecology. Recently, interactions with soil organisms have been shown to affect local abundances of plant species within communities, however, it is not known whether they might also drive patterns of rarity at large scales. Further, little is known about the specificity of soil-feedback effects, and whether closely related plants share more soil pathogens than more distantly related plants. In a multi-species soil-feedback experiment (using 19 species) we tested whether regionally and locally rare species differed in their response to soil biota. Regional rarity was measured using range size or IUCN status and local rarity by typical abundance within an area. All species were grown on soils trained by a variety of regionally and locally rare and common species, which also varied in their degree of relatedness to the target. We found that, in general, regionally rare species suffered more than twice as much from soil biota than regionally common species. Soil cultured by regionally rare species also had a more negative effect on subsequent plant growth, suggesting they may have also accumulated more pathogens. Local rarity did not predict feedback strength. Further, soil trained by closely related plants had a more negative effect on growth than soil trained by distant relatives, which indicates a phylogenetic signal in the host range of soil biota. We conclude that soil biota may well contribute to plant rarity at large spatial scales, which offers a novel explanation for plant rarity and commonness. Moreover, our results show that phylogenetic relatedness between plants was a good predictor of the likelihood that two plant species interacted negatively via soil biota, which might mean that soil pathogens could prevent the coexistence of closely related plants and could drive patterns of phylogenetic overdispersion. Our results suggest that soil pathogens could restrict the ability of rare species to shift their ranges and might need to be considered by conservation biologists seeking to protect populations of rare plants.</li>

•Optimizing drug independence represents a new way to design cancer treatments</p>
<p>Combination cancer therapies aim to improve the probability and magnitude of therapeutic responses and reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance in an individual patient. However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations. This insight represents a different way to interpret trial data and a different way to design combination therapies.</p>

<p><em>economy of scale: third partner strengthens a keystone ant-plant mutualism</em><br />

<ul>
<li>While foundation species can stabilize ecosystems at landscape scales, their ability to persist is often underlain by keystone interactions occurring at smaller scales. <em>Acacia drepanolobium</em> is a foundation tree, comprising &gt;95% of woody cover in East African black-cotton savanna ecosystems. Its dominance is underlain by a keystone mutualistic interaction with several symbiotic ant species in which it provides housing (swollen thorns) and carbohydrate-rich nectar from extra-floral nectaries (EFN). In return, it gains protection from catastrophic damage from mega-herbivores. <em>Crematogaster mimosae</em> is the ecologically dominant symbiotic ant in this system, also providing the highest protection services. In addition to tending EFN, <em>C. mimosae</em> tend scale insects for carbohydrate-rich honeydew. We investigated the role of scale insects in this specialized ant-plant interaction. Specifically, does this putatively redundant third partner strengthen the ant-plant mutualism by making the ant a better protector of the tree? Or does it weaken the mutualism by being costly to the tree while providing no additional benefit to the ant-plant mutualism? We coupled observational surveys with two scale-manipulation experiments and found evidence that this third partner strengthens the ant-plant mutualism. Trees with scale insects experimentally removed experienced a 2.5X increase in elephant damage compared to trees with scale insects present over 10 months. Reduced protection was driven by scale removal causing a decrease in ant colony size and per capita baseline activity and defensive behavior. We also found that ants increased scale-tending and the density of scale insects on trees when EFN were experimentally reduced. Thus, in this system, scale insects and EFN are likely complementary, rather than redundant, resources with scale insects benefitting ants when EFN production is low (such as during annual dry periods in this semi-arid ecosystem). This study reveals that a third-partner strengthens an ant-plant mutualism that serves to stabilize a whole ecosystem.</li>

<ul>
<li>The breadth of habitat occupied by a species, and the rate at which a species can expand into new habitats has important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here we explore when extant species of free-living cupuladriid bryozoans expanded into new benthic Caribbean habitats that emerged during the final stages of formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Habitat breadth was estimated using the abundances of over 90,000 colonies in ten cupuladriid species, along with the ecological and sedimentary characteristics of the samples in which they occurred. Data reveal that all species expanded their habitat breadths during the last 6 Myr, but did so at a different tempo. ‘Young’ species - those that originated after 5 Ma - expanded relatively quickly, whereas ‘old’ species - those that originated before 9 Ma - took a further 2 Myr to achieve a comparable level of expansion. We propose that, like invasive species, young species are less restrained when expanding their habitat breadths compared to older well-established species. Understanding the mechanism causing this restraint requires further research.</li>

<p><em>different megafauna vary in their seed dispersal effectiveness of the megafaunal fruit platymitra macrocarpa (annonaceae)</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The world’s largest terrestrial animals (megafauna) can play profound roles in seed dispersal. Yet, the term ‘megafauna’ is often used to encompass a diverse range of body sizes and physiologies of, primarily, herbivorous animals. To determine the extent to which these animals varied in their seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE), we compared the contribution of different megafauna for the large-fruited <em>Platymitra macrocarpa</em> (Annonaceae), in a tropical evergreen forest in Thailand. We quantified ‘seed dispersal effectiveness’ by measuring the quantity and quality contributions of all consumers of <em>P</em>. <em>macrocarpa</em> fruit. Seed dispersal quantity was the proportion of the crop consumed by each species. Quality was defined as the proportion of seeds handled by each animal taxon that survived to produce a 2-month seedling. Megafauna (elephants, sambar deer, bears) dispersed 78% of seeds that produced seedlings, with 21% dispersed by gibbons (a medium-sized frugivore). The main megafaunal consumers displayed different dispersal strategies. Elephants were the most effective dispersers (37% of seedlings) and they achieved this by being high-quality and low-quantity dispersers. Bears displayed a similar strategy but were especially rare visitors to the trees (24% of the total seedlings produced). Sambar were high-quantity dispersers, but most seeds they handled did not survive and they were responsible for only 17% of seedlings. Gibbons displayed a high SDE relative to their body size, but they probably cannot match the role of elephants despite being more regular consumers of the fruit. The low density and poor regeneration of <em>P</em>. <em>macrocarpa</em> in the study site suggest that current dispersal rates by megafauna are insufficient, possibly reflecting reduced or missing megafauna populations. We show that different megafaunal species disperse seeds in different ways and may make unique contributions to the reproductive success of the plant species.</li>

<p><em>species diversity concurrently dilutes and amplifies transmission in a zoonotic host–pathogen system through competing mechanisms</em><br />

<ul>
<li>In this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and increased zoonotic disease emergence, it is imperative to understand the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic pathogen dynamics in wildlife. Whether increasing biodiversity should lead to a decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an ∼35% mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse, in areas with higher small mammal diversity—a dilution effect. However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher diversity—a component amplification effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same host–pathogen system; there is a component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate), but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on reservoir host population density is stronger. These results suggest we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if we want to make generalizable predictions across host–pathogen systems</li>

<li>Mutations that add, subtract, rearrange, or otherwise refashion genome structure often affect phenotypes, although the fragmented nature of most contemporary assemblies obscures them. To discover such mutations, we assembled the first new reference-quality genome of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> since its initial sequencing. By comparing this new genome to the existing <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly, we created a structural variant map of unprecedented resolution and identified extensive genetic variation that has remained hidden until now. Many of these variants constitute candidates underlying phenotypic variation, including tandem duplications and a transposable element insertion that amplifies the expression of detoxification-related genes associated with nicotine resistance. The abundance of important genetic variation that still evades discovery highlights how crucial high-quality reference genomes are to deciphering phenotypes.</li>

<li>The mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is one of only two self-fertilizing hermaphroditic fish and inhabits mangrove forests. While selfing can be advantageous, it reduces heterozygosity and decreases genetic diversity. Studies using microsatellites found that there are variable levels of selfing among populations of K. marmoratus but overall there is a low rate of outcrossing and therefore, low heterozygosity. In this study, we used whole-genome data to assess the level of genetic diversity in different lineages of the mangrove rivulus and infer the phylogenetic relationships among those lineages. We sequenced whole genomes from 15 lineages that were homozygous at microsatellite loci and used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine heterozygosity levels. More variation was uncovered than in studies using microsatellite data due to the resolution of full genome sequencing data. Inferred phylogenetic relationships suggest that lineages largely group by their geographic distribution. The use of whole-genome data provided further insight into genetic diversity in this unique species. These data suggest that there is previously undescribed variation within lineages of K. marmoratus. Although this study was limited by the number of lineages that were available, these results highlight the need to sequence additional individuals within and among lineages.</li>

<ul>
<li>Environmental heterogeneity is a key determinant of genetic and phenotypic diversity. Stable and homogenous environments tends to result in evolution of specialism and local adaptations, while temporally unpredictable environments may maintain a diversity of specialists, promote generalist strategies, or favour diversified bet hedging strategies. We compared salinity tolerance between two anadromous subpopulations of pike (<em>Esox Lucius</em>) that utilize freshwater spawning sites with different salinity regimes. Eggs from each population were artificially fertilized and incubated in a salinity gradient (0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 psu) using a split-brood design. Effects on embryonic development, hatching success, survival of larvae, and fry body length were compared between populations and families. The population naturally spawning in the stable freshwater habitat showed signs of specialization for freshwater spawning. The population exposed to fluctuating selective pressure in a spawning area with occasional brackish water intrusions tolerated higher salinities and displayed considerable variation in reaction norms. Genetic differences and plasticity of salinity tolerance may enable populations to cope with changes in salinity regimes associated with future climate change. That geographically adjacent subpopulations can constitute separate units with different genetic characteristics must be considered in management and conservation efforts to avoid potentially negative effects of genetic admixture on population fitness and persistence.</li>

<ul>
<li>Evolutionary innovations are often achieved by repurposing existing genes to perform new functions; however, the mechanisms enabling the transition from old to new remain controversial. We identified mutations in bacteriophage λ’s host-recognition gene <em>J</em> that confer enhanced adsorption to λ’s native receptor, LamB, and the ability to access a new receptor, OmpF. The mutations destabilize λ particles and cause conformational bistability of J, which yields progeny of multiple phenotypic forms, each proficient at different receptors. This work provides an example of how nongenetic protein variation can catalyze an evolutionary innovation. We propose that cases where a single genotype can manifest as multiple phenotypes may be more common than previously expected and offer a general mechanism for evolutionary innovation.</li>

<li>Ecological neutral theory has elicited strong opinions in recent years. Here, we review these opinions and strip away some unfortunate problems with semantics to reveal three major underlying questions. Only one of these relates to neutral theory and the importance of ecological drift, whereas the others involve the link between pattern and process, the tradeoff between sim- plicity and complexity in modeling, and the role of stochasticity and drift in ecology. We explain how neutral theory cannot be simultaneously used both as a null hypothesis and as an approximation. However, we also show how neutral theory always has a valuable use in one of these two roles, even though the real world is not neutral.</li>

<p>•Recent analyses of time-series data suggest biodiversity is not declining at local scales as often claimed.<br />
•We argue existing time-series are inappropriate for testing hypotheses about biodiversity change.<br />
•Datasets are low quality, lack spatial representation, and fail to account for key drivers of change.<br />
•Failure to consider these problems has led to misinterpretations and unwarranted extrapolations.<br />
•New analyses must use higher-quality datasets to test improved hypotheses about diversity change.</p>
<p>Recently, a debate has developed over how biodiversity is changing across the planet. While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of time-series data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Specifically, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have different implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using different types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.</p>

<li>The aggregation of many independent estimates can outperform the most accurate individual judgement. This centenarian finding, popularly known as the ‘wisdom of crowds’, has been applied to problems ranging from the diagnosis of cancer to financial forecasting<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21706.html#ref4">5</a>. It is widely believed that social influence undermines collective wisdom by reducing the diversity of opinions within the crowd. Here, we show that if a large crowd is structured in small independent groups, deliberation and social influence within groups improve the crowd’s collective accuracy. We asked a live crowd (<em>N</em> = 5,180) to respond to general-knowledge questions (for example, “What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?”). Participants first answered individually, then deliberated and made consensus decisions in groups of five, and finally provided revised individual estimates. We found that averaging consensus decisions was substantially more accurate than aggregating the initial independent opinions. Remarkably, combining as few as four consensus choices outperformed the wisdom of thousands of individuals.</li>
<li>pooling knowledge from individuals who participated in independent debates reduces collective error. Critically, this is achieved without compromising the democratic principle of ‘one vote, one value’. This builds on the political notion of deliberative polls, as a practical mechanism to solve the conundrum between equality and deliberation, as more and more people’s voices are asked to make a decision and massive deliberation becomes impractical. Here, we demonstrated that in questions of general knowledge, where it is easy to judge the correctness of the group choice and in the absence of strategic voting behaviour, aggregating consensus choices made in small groups increases the wisdom of crowds. This result supports political theories postulating that authentic deliberation, and not simply voting, can lead to better democratic decisions.</li>

<li>Although people assume that their first guess about a matter of fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced second guess contributes additional information, such that the average of two guesses is better than either guess alone. This observed benefit of averaging multiple responses from the same person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.<br />
Temporal separation of guesses increases the benefit of within-person averaging by increasing the independence of guesses, thus making a second guess from the same person more like a guess from a completely different individual. Beyond having theoretical implications about the probabilistic nature of knowledge, these results suggest that the benefit of averaging two guesses from one individual can serve as a quantitative measure of the benefit of ‘‘sleeping on it.’’</li>

<li>We introduce a general framework for modeling functionally diverse problem-solving agents. In this framework, problem-solving agents possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers.

<p><em>thermal niche evolution across replicated anolis lizard adaptive radiations</em><br />
alex r. gunderson et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2241">http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2241</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Elucidating how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms interact to produce and maintain biodiversity is a fundamental problem in evolutionary ecology. Here, we focus on how physiological evolution affects performance and species coexistence along the thermal niche axis in replicated radiations of <em>Anolis</em> lizards best known for resource partitioning based on morphological divergence. We find repeated divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations, and that this divergence significantly affects performance within natural thermal environments. Morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably differ in their thermal physiology, providing evidence that physiological divergence facilitates species coexistence within anole communities. Despite repeated divergence, phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that physiological traits have evolved more slowly than key morphological traits related to the structural niche. Phylogenetic analyses also reveal that physiological divergence is correlated with divergence in broad-scale habitat climatic features commonly used to estimate thermal niche evolution, but that the latter incompletely predicts variation in the former. We provide comprehensive evidence for repeated adaptive evolution of physiological divergence within <em>Anolis</em> adaptive radiations, including the complementary roles of physiological and morphological divergence in promoting community-level diversity. We recommend greater integration of performance-based traits into analyses of climatic niche evolution, as they facilitate a more complete understanding of the phenotypic and ecological consequences of climatic divergence.</li>

<p><em>food availability drives plastic self-repair response in a basal metazoan- case study on the ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi a. agassiz 1865</em><br />
katharina tissy bading et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16346-w">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16346-w</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Many marine invertebrates including ctenophores are capable of extensive body regeneration when injured. However, as for the invasive ctenophore <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, there is a constant subportion of individuals not undergoing whole body regeneration but forming functionally stable half-animals instead. Yet, the driving factors of this phenomenon have not been addressed so far. This study sheds new light on how differences in food availability affect self-repair choice and regeneration success in cydippid larvae of <em>M</em>. <em>leidyi</em>. As expected, high food availability favored whole-body regeneration. However, under low food conditions half-animals became the preferential self-repair mode. Remarkably, both regenerating and half-animals showed very similar survival chances under respective food quantities. As a consequence of impaired food uptake after injury, degeneration of the digestive system would often occur indicating limited energy storage capacities. Taken together, this indicates that half-animals may represent an alternative energy-saving trajectory which implies self-repair plasticity as an adaptive trade-off between high regeneration costs and low energy storage capacities. We conclude that self-repair plasticity could lead to higher population fitness of ctenophores under adverse conditions such as in ships’ ballast water tanks which is postulated to be the major vector source for the species’ spreading around the globe.</li>

<p><em>the effect of nanosecond pulsed high frequency discharges on the temperature evolution of ignition kernels</em><br />
jonathan m. bonebrake et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proci.2018.06.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proci.2018.06.027</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Nanosecond pulsed high frequency discharges (NPHFD) have attracted interest as a means of enhancing ignition probability and ignition kernel growth rates. Previous studies have shown that increasing the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a NPHFD burst can result in enhanced probability of ignition relative to lower values of PRF. The cause of this enhanced ignition probability is not well understood, in part, because the temperature evolution of ignition kernels have not been measured. In this work, an inverse deconvolution technique was developed, evaluated, and used to determine the temporal evolution of the temperature and volume of ignition kernels initiated by NPHFD and single pulse discharges. Radiation intensity measurements of ignition kernels were compared to modeled values to determine path-averaged temperatures. Comparisons of values derived using the deconvolution technique and measured temperatures above a McKenna burner typically agreed within 4%. When the technique was applied to ignition kernels initiated by NPHFD over a range of PRF, it was observed that increasing the PRF of a discharge sequence increased the initial rate of change of the temperature as compared to lower PRF. Additionally, kernels generated with high PRF discharges achieved higher initial peak temperatures than those generated by lower PRF discharges. A relaxation in temperature was observed following the peak, which was followed by a subsequent temperature increase in all cases generated with PRF  &gt; 10 kHz. PRF above 5 kHz result in larger initial kernel volumes and volume rates of change compared to those observed for lower PRF values. This is attributed to pulse-to-pulse coupling during the energy deposition process. The observed relationship between kernel temperature, volume, and PRF help to explain ignition probability measurements reported previously. Findings from the effort illustrate how the rate of energy deposition through pulse-to-pulse coupling can significantly enhance ignition through elevated temperatures.</li>

<p><em>the evolutionary signal in metagenome phyletic profiles predicts many gene functions</em><br />
vedrana vidulin et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>The function of many genes is still not known even in model organisms. An increasing availability of microbiome DNA sequencing data provides an opportunity to infer gene function in a systematic manner.<br />
Results<br />
We evaluated if the evolutionary signal contained in metagenome phyletic profiles (MPP) is predictive of a broad array of gene functions. The MPPs are an encoding of environmental DNA sequencing data that consists of relative abundances of gene families across metagenomes. We find that such MPPs can accurately predict 826 Gene Ontology functional categories, while drawing on human gut microbiomes, ocean metagenomes, and DNA sequences from various other engineered and natural environments. Overall, in this task, the MPPs are highly accurate, and moreover they provide coverage for a set of Gene Ontology terms largely complementary to standard phylogenetic profiles, derived from fully sequenced genomes. We also find that metagenomes approximated from taxon relative abundance obtained via 16S rRNA gene sequencing may provide surprisingly useful predictive models. Crucially, the MPPs derived from different types of environments can infer distinct, non-overlapping sets of gene functions and therefore complement each other. Consistently, simulations on &gt; 5000 metagenomes indicate that the amount of data is not in itself critical for maximizing predictive accuracy, while the diversity of sampled environments appears to be the critical factor for obtaining robust models.<br />
Conclusions<br />
In past work, metagenomics has provided invaluable insight into ecology of various habitats, into diversity of microbial life and also into human health and disease mechanisms. We propose that environmental DNA sequencing additionally constitutes a useful tool to predict biological roles of genes, yielding inferences out of reach for existing comparative genomics approaches.</li>

<li>thus we can also understand how someone becomes intolerant, by the narrowing of their world, when they have or are forced to have lower diversity in friendships, and thus lower diversity in ideas and beliefs.</li>
<li>this could be a major mechanism to explain differences in productiveness to society between groups — for example why spinsters are (collectively) often much more productive in society than unmarried men (who collectively tend to be more destructive). it is not a behaviour inherent in the group, but due to a difference in the diversity, and thus relationships of the group.</li>

<p>what if driving force of evolution is not niche variability but need for diversity? eventually suitable diverse form arrives in niche and happens to be more suited than general or previous form, so comes by chance to be more in that niche. the different species we see in different niches arise not because of the niches themselves but because the species arise or arrive suited to the niche? really need to read darwin’s words closely on this, as the general perception is that a niche causes speciation.</p>

<p>They argued that this positive relationship indicates speciation drives species richness. However, this speciation-driven hypothesis has been challenged by several other studies (Cadena et al. 2005, Kiflawi et al. 2007, Pereira et al. 2007, Whittaker et al. 2007, Witt and Maliakal-Witt 2007, Birand and Howard 2008, Gruner et al. 2008). The point of debate is not so much about how speciation could promote species diversity (this is rather obvious) but about whether the endemics–diversity relationship is a reliable testimony of this speciation-driven hypothesis.</p>

<li>there is a mental shorthand that confuses what exists with what is good. unfortunately people also mistakenly use the theory of evolution in this way, they believe that because something exists it must be the most well adapted, the most evolved. in reality, most things are not as well adapted, that is, not as ideal, as we conceive them to be.
<ul>
<li>just because something is not happening or appears not to be happening at a certain moment in time, does not mean it is “harder” or cannot or does not happen.</li>
<li>for example, it could be just as “easy” as what is happening now, but we don't realise it is, or because actually what's happening now is not really so easy and there are people who want to keep it that way, which makes it harder for everyone to change to a more responsible way of doing things.</li>

<li>a deadly race between our own ability to learn and those who would destroy us, our civilisation and the world. there are even those who claim that these wars make us stronger, that they kill the weak and enhance the strong — but that is an abusive manipulation of reality. evolution is not competition, it is ability to deal with reality as it comes. and so diversity, not perfection, is the way of the world.</li>

<li>we have been taught that surviving is the best that we can do, but it is not — thriving is better.</li>
<li>an understanding of the crucial role of diversity in our flourishing helps us appreciate the differences between people and dispels the myth of similarity which abusers use to manipulate us. if a system does not create diversity, then it is bound to collapse.</li>
