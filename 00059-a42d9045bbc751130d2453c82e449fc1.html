<p><em>cognitive and interpersonal features of intellectual humility</em><br />

<li>Four studies examined intellectual humility—the degree to which people recognize that their beliefs might be wrong. Using a new Intellectual Humility (IH) Scale, Study 1 showed that intellectual humility was associated with variables related to openness, curiosity, tolerance of ambiguity, and low dogmatism. Study 2 revealed that participants high in intellectual humility were less certain that their beliefs about religion were correct and judged people less on the basis of their religious opinions. In Study 3, participants high in intellectual humility were less inclined to think that politicians who changed their attitudes were “flip-flopping,” and Study 4 showed that people high in intellectual humility were more attuned to the strength of persuasive arguments than those who were low. In addition to extending our understanding of intellectual humility, this research demonstrates that the IH Scale is a valid measure of the degree to which people recognize that their beliefs are fallible.</li>

<p><em>preverbal infants affirm third-party interventions that protect victims from aggressors</em><br />
yasuhiro kanakogi et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0037">dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0037</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Protective interventions by a third party on the behalf of others are generally admired, and as such are associated with our notions of morality, justice and heroism 1,​2,​3,​4 . Indeed, stories involving such third-party interventions have pervaded popular culture throughout recorded human history, in myths, books and movies. The current developmental picture is that we begin to engage in this type of intervention by preschool age. For instance, 3-year-old children intervene in harmful interactions to protect victims from bullies 5 , and furthermore, not only punish wrongdoers but also give priority to helping the victim 6 . It remains unknown, however, when we begin to affirm such interventions performed by others. Here we reveal these developmental origins in 6- and 10-month old infants (N = 132). After watching aggressive interactions involving a third-party agent who either interfered or did not, 6-month-old infants preferred the former. Subsequent experiments confirmed the psychological processes underlying such choices: 6-month-olds regarded the interfering agent to be protecting the victim from the aggressor, but only older infants affirmed such an intervention after considering the intentions of the interfering agent. These findings shed light upon the developmental trajectory of perceiving, understanding and performing protective third-party interventions, suggesting that our admiration for and emphasis upon such acts — so prevalent in thousands of stories across human cultures — is rooted within the preverbal infant’s mind.</li>

<p>&quot;The Getzels-Jackson effect is not restricted to schools, and it persists into adulthood. Decision makers and authority figures in business, science, and government all say they value creation, but when tested, they do not value creators.<br />
Why? Because people who are more creative also tend to be more playful, unconventional, and unpredictable, and all of this makes them harder to control. No matter how much we say we value creation, deep down, most of us value control more. And so we fear change and favor familiarity. Rejecting is a reflex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that Galambos eventually turned out to be right is beside the point. Organizations are not supposed to work this way. Brilliant, innovative thinking is meant to be encouraged. Galambos and his idea should and could have made a beachhead on a whole new continent of fertile research opportunities. Instead, important discoveries about glia and the brain were delayed for decades. We are learning things today that we could have found out in the 1970s. So why would a distinguished scientist like David Rioch be provoked to anger by an idea proposed by an equally distinguished scientist like Robert Galambos?<br />
The problem was not Rioch. Robert Galambos’s story is typical—it happens in almost every organization almost all the time. Kelly Johnson’s is not. Both men are examples of what management scholars Larry Downes and Paul Nunes call “truth-tellers”:<br />
Truth-tellers are genuinely passionate about solving big problems. They harangue you with their vision, and as a result they rarely stay in one company for very long. They are not model employees—their true loyalty is to the future, not next quarter’s profits. They can tell you what’s coming, but not necessarily when or how. Truth-tellers are often eccentric and difficult to manage. They speak a strange language, one that isn’t focused on incremental change and polite business-speak. Learning to find them is hard. Learning to understand them, and appreciate their value, is even harder.<br />
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truth-tellers are a bit like the glia of organizations: long overlooked, yet essential for regeneration. They may not be popular. The truth is often awkward and unwelcome, and so are the people who tell it.<br />
As we have seen in our discussions of rejection, confrontations about ideas are hardwired into human nature. The hallmark of a creative organization is that it is much more receptive to new thinking than the world in general. A creative organization does not resent conflicts over concepts; it resolves them. But most organizations are not like Lockheed—they are like Walter Reed. So most truth-tellers are not treated like Kelly Johnson—they are treated like Robert Galambos. We do not walk in a welcoming world when we are given the gift of great thoughts. Great thoughts are great threats.<br />

<p>expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot control the future. Being too rigid about making things happen the way you planned stops you from reacting to emerging problems and causes you to miss unexpected opportunities. Have high expectations about what and few expectations about how. This is the opposite of the way most organizations operate.</li>

Such vigilance is adaptive, but can also be costly in environments where people sometimes make mistakes, because incorrectly attributing bad character to good people damages existing relationships and discourages forming new relationships13,14,15,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0425-1#ref-CR16">16</a>. The ability to accurately infer the moral character of others is critical for healthy social functioning, but the computational processes that support this ability are not well understood. Here, we show that moral inference is explained by an asymmetric Bayesian updating mechanism in which beliefs about the morality of bad agents are more uncertain (and therefore more volatile) than beliefs about the morality of good agents. This asymmetry seems to be a property of learning about immoral agents in general, as we also find greater uncertainty for beliefs about the non-moral traits of bad agents. Our model and data reveal a cognitive mechanism that permits flexible updating of beliefs about potentially threatening others, a mechanism that could facilitate forgiveness when initial bad impressions turn out to be inaccurate. Our findings suggest that negative moral impressions destabilize beliefs about others, promoting cognitive flexibility in the service of cooperative but cautious behaviour.</li>

<p><em>choice overload reduces neural signatures of choice set value in dorsal striatum and anterior cingulate cortex</em><br />
elena reutskaja et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0440-2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0440-2</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>choice overload can sometimes have serious consequences, says Colin Camerer, Caltech’s Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics and the T&amp;C Chen Center for Social and Decision Neuroscience Leadership Chair. As an example, he points to Sweden’s partial privatization of its social security system. The government allowed citizens to move some of their retirement savings into private funds. The government gave them hundreds of funds from which to choose, and conducted a large advertising campaign encouraging them to make their own choice. At first, nearly 70 percent of the eligible adult population took an active role in choosing a fund, but the percentage quickly dropped off. After 10 years, only about 1 percent of newly eligible Swedes were making an active decision about where to put their retirement money.<br />
Now, a study conducted at Caltech by Camerer reveals new insights into choice overload, including the parts of the brain responsible for it, and how many options the brain actually prefers when it is making a choice.<br />
In the study, volunteers were presented with pictures of scenic landscapes that they could have printed on a piece of merchandise such as a coffee mug. Each participant was offered a variety of sets of images, containing six, 12, or 24 pictures. They were asked to make their decisions while a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine recorded activity in their brains. As a control, the volunteers were asked to browse the images again, but this time their image selection was made randomly by a computer.<br />
The fMRI scans revealed brain activity in two regions while the participants were making their choices: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where the potential costs and benefits of decisions are weighed, Camerer says; and the striatum, a part of the brain responsible for determining value.<br />
Camerer and his colleagues also saw that activity in these two regions was highest in subjects who had 12 options to pick from, and lowest in those with either six or 24 items to choose from. Camerer says that pattern of activity is probably the result of the striatum and the ACC interacting and weighing the increasing potential for reward (getting a picture they really like for their mug) against the increasing amount of work the brain will have to do to evaluate possible outcomes.<br />
As the number of options increases, the potential reward increases, but then begins to level off due to diminishing returns. “The idea is that the best out of 12 is probably rather good, while the jump to the best out of 24 is not a big improvement,” Camerer says. At the same time, the amount of effort required to evaluate the options increases. Together, mental effort and the potential reward result in a sweet spot where the reward isn’t too low and the effort isn’t too high. This pattern was not seen when the subjects merely browsed the images because there was no potential for reward, and thus less effort was required when evaluating the options.<br />
Camerer points out that 12 isn’t some magic number for human decision-making, but rather an artifact of the experimental design. He estimates that the ideal number of options for a person is probably somewhere between 8 and 15, depending on the perceived reward, the difficulty of evaluating the options, and the person’s individual characteristics.<br />
Of course, a trip to the nearest grocery store is likely to reveal that lots of products come in many more than a dozen varieties. There might be a whole aisle of toothpastes of varying brands, sizes, flavors, textures, and properties, and on the condiment aisle, there might be dozens of kinds of mustards to choose from.<br />
Camerer says that’s partly because people tend to feel freer and like they have more control over their lives when they have more options to choose from, even if having all those options ends up distressing them at decision time.<br />
“Essentially, our eyes are bigger than our stomachs,” he says. “When we think about how many choices we want, we may not be mentally representing the frustrations of making the decision.”<br />
Camerer says future research in this area could explore and attempt to quantify the mental costs of making a decision.<br />
“What is mental effort? What does thinking cost? It’s poorly understood,” he says.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Modern societies offer a large variety of choices, which is generally thought to be valuable. But having too much choice can be detrimental if the costs of choice outweigh its benefits due to ‘choice overload’. Current explanatory models of choice overload mainly derive from behavioural studies. A neuroscientific investigation could further inform these models by revealing the covert mental processes during decision-making. We explored choice overload using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects were either choosing from varying-sized choice sets or were browsing them. When choosing from sets of 6, 12 or 24 items, functional magnetic resonance imaging activity in the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex resembled an inverted U-shaped function of choice set size. Activity was highest for 12-item sets, which were perceived as having ‘the right amount’ of options and was lower for 6-item and 24-item sets, which were perceived as ‘too small’ and ‘too large’, respectively. Enhancing choice set value by adding a dominant option led to an overall increase of activity. When subjects were browsing, the decision costs were diminished and the inverted U-shaped activity patterns vanished. Activity in the striatum and anterior cingulate reflects choice set value and can serve as neural indicator of choice overload.</p>

<p><em>measuring workload in a multitasking environment using fractal dimension of pupil dilation</em><br />

<p>&quot;If your vitals are bad, then something is wrong with your body and doctors will work to figure out what's wrong with you,&quot; said Jung Hyup Kim, an assistant professor of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering in the MU College of Engineering. &quot;What about your mental health? Many people multitask, but currently there is no measurement for someone's mental well-being. However, we found that the size of a pupil could be the key to measuring someone's mental state while they multitask.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone experiences stress differently. Kim and Xiaonan Yang, a graduate student at MU, wanted to find a data-driven way for different industries -- such as emergency communicators, office workers, industry and manufacturing factory workers -- to universally measure the levels of stress in their employees while they are multitasking, or performing work-related duties with simultaneous low and high complexity tasks.</p>
<p>To do this, they compared data from a workload metric developed by NASA for its astronauts with their observations of pupillary response from participants in a lab study. Using a simulated oil and gas refinery plant control room, Kim and Yang watched, through motion-capture and eye-tracking technology, as the participants reacted to unexpected changes, such as alarms, while simultaneously watching the performance of gauges on two monitors. During the scenario's simple tasks, the participants' eye searching behaviors were more predictable. Yet, as the tasks became more complex and unexpected changes occurred, their eye behaviors became more erratic.</p>
<p>Through the use of the data from this lab study and a formula Kim and Yang applied called &quot;fractal dimension,&quot; Kim and Yang discovered a negative relationship between the fractal dimension of pupil dilation and a person's workload, showing the researchers that pupil dilation could be used to indicate the mental workload of a person in a multitasking environment. Kim and Yang hope this finding can give a better insight into how systems should be designed to avoid mentally overloading workers and build a safer working environment. One day this finding could give employers and educators alike a tool to determine the maximum stress level a person can experience before they become fatigued, and their performance begins to negatively change.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be great if people could work perfectly every time,&quot; Kim said. &quot;But when you're tired, you often make a mistake. So, if we can monitor a worker's mental well-being, then we can hopefully prevent future mistakes from happening.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim and Yang plan to apply this finding to further research involving different age groups and certain biometric measures such as heartbeat, brain signals and muscle or nerve reactions.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of the fractal dimension of pupil dilation as a measure of workload in a multitasking environment. Researchers have found that pupil dilation can reveal the underlying mechanism of the cognitive workload in a dynamic task environment. However, the workload metrics by using pupillary responses in a multitasking environment are not well studied in the literature. In this study, the participants’ pupil dilation was collected and analyzed by using a fractal analysis technique to assess the participants’ workload during the experiment. During the experiment, each participant performed a process monitoring task and Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) task together. The process monitoring task simulated the responsibilities of process operators in the control room of oil and gas refinery plants. The MATB task consisted of system monitoring, target tracking, and dynamic resource management. To validate the outcome of this new metric, NASA-TLX questionnaires were used to measure the subjective workload, and the result of NASA-TLX was compared to the fractal dimension result. The findings from this study showed that the fractal dimension of pupil dilation could be used as a new physiological index to measure the workload in a multitasking environment.</p>

<li>thinking about how we think
<ul>
<li>my empathy and predictive sense as a internalised informal chance forecast</li>
<li>for example, speed. you might remember from physics the definition that something’s speed is the frequency with which it occurs. but what happens when we change a speed? are we increasing the frequency, and is it by changing the likelihood? what does speed mean when we say a catalyst speeds up a reaction? the chemist’s reaction rate is a description of speed.
<ul>
<li>what if we can replace speed with the concept of likelihood? so that something is faster as its likelihood increases? so a catalyst does not increase the speed of a reaction but rather makes it more likely, and the passing of time does the rest.</li>
<li>so too words and concepts, ideas and beliefs are catalysts that make certain actions more or less likely, depending on how you define the action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we are amoral — without morals — when we do not know, have not learned the concept of, or have not gained or have lost the ability to think about how something we do affects others. for young children, this may mean that they have not been taught the concept of caring for others, or that this concept is not salient to them, or that they have been taught to prioritise other things — whether by the intention of their guardians, neglect, or circumstance. it may well be that their frontal brain lobes are not developed enough to learn this yet — but it may be that learning and practicing this social skill is one of the major ways in which our brains develop in complexity and ability as we grow.
<ul>
<li>they are all amoral, because their only way to understand morality is their own internal feelings</li>

<li>why do people devalue what is freely given? it is a response learned from a corrupted culture, a culture that affects us all, no matter whether we realise it or not. it might seem irrelevant, or unimportant, but because this culture shapes so much of our lives, in a way that is very often not understood, it is one of the important things we need to know on our way to leading better lives.</li>

<ul>
<li>salience not importance
<ul>
<li>it can be difficult to understand the dominance that salience has on our lives. what is salient appears more important, although it is almost always not as important as it appears, due to probabilities — the vast majority of important data escape our notice and understanding, so if we base our decisions of importance on only what we can perceive or understand then we are bound to make decisions which do not match reality much more often than our decisions happen to match reality.</li>
<li>we can understand better what real issues are by recognising those which are misleadingly salient</li>
<li>what is most salient is often not what is most important</li>
<li>people don't neglect the environment because they are evil, although some do, but like many human responsibilities, because something else more salient has their attention. that isn't to say that what has caught our attention is more important, simply that we have given it our attention.</li>
<li>“the role of such formal knowledge will be overappreciated precisely because it is highly visible.”</li>
<li>what is salient is taken as reality, when it is not. comparison of different cultures and societies, among many other different ways of experiencing life, can show us that reality is not what somebody tells us it is.</li>
