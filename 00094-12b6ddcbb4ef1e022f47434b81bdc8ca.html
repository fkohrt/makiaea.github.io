<p><em>animals in a bacterial world, a new imperative for the life sciences</em><br />

<li>In the last two decades, the widespread application of genetic and genomic approaches has revealed a bacterial world astonishing in its ubiquity and diversity. This review examines how a growing knowledge of the vast range of animal–bacterial interactions, whether in shared ecosystems or intimate symbioses, is fundamentally altering our understanding of animal biology. Specifically, we highlight recent techno-logical and intellectual advances that have changed our thinking about five questions: how have bacteria facilitated the origin and evolution of animals; how do animals and bacteria affect each other's genomes; how does normal animal development depend on bacterial partners; how is homeostasis maintained between animals and their symbionts; and how can ecological approaches deepen our understanding of the multiple levels of animal–bacterial interaction. As answers to these fundamental questions emerge, all biologists will be challenged to broaden their appreciation of these interactions and to include investigations of the relationships between and among bacteria and their animal partners as we seek a better understanding of the natural world.</li>
<li>the New Synthesis of the 1930s and beyond must be reconsidered in terms of three areas in which it has proven weakest: symbiosis, de-velopment, and microbiology (115). One of these areas, microbiology, presents particular challenges both to the species concept, as formulated by Ernst Mayr in 1942, and to the concept that vertical transmission of genetic information is the only motor of selectable evolutionary change.</li>

<p><em>microbes can help explain the evolution of host altruism</em><br />
ohad lewin-epstein, ranit aharonov &amp; lilach hadany 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>The evolution of altruistic behaviour, which is costly to the donor but beneficial for the recipient, is among the most intriguing questions in evolutionary biology. Several theories have been proposed to explain it, including kin selection, group selection and reciprocity. Here we propose that microbes that manipulate their hosts to act altruistically could be favoured by selection, and may play a role in the widespread occurrence of altruism. Using computational models, we find that microbe-induced altruism can explain the evolution of host altruistic behaviour under wider conditions than host-centred theories, including in a fully mixed host population, without repeating interactions or individual recognition. Our results suggest that factors such as antibiotics that kill microbes might negatively affect cooperation in a wide range of organisms.</li>

<p><em>trees, fungi and bacteria: tripartite metatranscriptomics of a root microbiome responding to soil contamination</em><br />
e. gonzalez et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-018-0432-5">http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-018-0432-5</a></p>
<ul>
<li>From gene expression alone, the major responses of <em>Salix purpurea</em> cv. ‘Fish Creek’ to soil contamination do not seem to be direct degradation, immobilisation or exclusion of contaminants but rather widespread, extraordinarily complex, alterations to interactions with microbiota. The extremely diverse fungal community, revealed using a bioinformatics approach unconstrained by the requirement of <em>a priori</em> nucleotide sequence, responds dynamically to contamination both with changes to gene expression but also with substantial shifts in the community makeup. Much like the host plant, fungal gene expression was dominated by alterations in pathways associated to microbiome interactions as opposed to direct hydrocarbon degradation. Surprisingly, gene expression representing increased petroleum hydrocarbon metabolism equipment came from an <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> species whose total expression was uniformly more abundant in roots of contaminated trees. It seems possible that, given the successful contamination tolerance, willows may depend on symbiosis to tolerate stressful environmental conditions instead of relying solely on their own metabolism.<br />
While polyadenylated bacterial sequences are often not quantified across experimental systems investigated with eukaryote expression in mind, the bacterial functionality observed here is thought-provoking, revealing a plausible set of expressed genes indicating tripartite mutualism. A finding which is useful in providing a convincing reminder that observing the entirety of generated data, even that which is commonly discarded, is always of potential value for exposing the unexpected. Most importantly, with regard to the attempted all-inclusive strategy of observing all expressed sequences within a biological sample, regardless of origin, is how extensively interpretation of expression could be confounded if plant, fungal or bacterial expression were investigated as responsive to treatment (here being contamination) in isolation, and thus how crucial it is to attempt observation of the entire microbiome and wider metaorganism. This metatranscriptomic approach, which marries an understanding of the uncertainty of microbiome biology with the strengths and limitations of current bioinformatics, should be broadly transferable through utility for biological samples containing expressed sequences from well-characterised, poorly characterised or entirely unknown organisms at a diversity of low or high complexity.</li>

<p><em>microbial genetic composition tunes host longevity</em><br />

<pre><code>    •Systematic analysis of longevity-promoting microbial genetic variations  
      •Colanic acid as a pro-longevity natural compound effective in different species  
      •Bacterial metabolites regulate host mitochondrial dynamics and UPRmit  
</code></pre>
<p>Homeostasis of the gut microbiota critically influences host health and aging. Developing genetically engineered probiotics holds great promise as a new therapeutic paradigm to promote healthy aging. Here, through screening 3,983 <em>Escherichia coli</em> mutants, we discovered that 29 bacterial genes, when deleted, increase longevity in the host <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>. A dozen of these bacterial mutants also protect the host from age-related progression of tumor growth and amyloid-beta accumulation. Mechanistically, we discovered that five bacterial mutants promote longevity through increased secretion of the polysaccharide colanic acid (CA), which regulates mitochondrial dynamics and unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in the host. Purified CA polymers are sufficient to promote longevity via ATFS-1, the host UPRmt-responsive transcription factor. Furthermore, the mitochondrial changes and longevity effects induced by CA are conserved across different species. Together, our results identified molecular targets for developing pro-longevity microbes and a bacterial metabolite acting on host mitochondria to promote longevity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;These findings are also interesting and have implications from the biological point of view in the way we understand host-microbe communication,&quot; Wang said. &quot;Mitochondria seem to have evolved from bacteria that millions of years ago entered primitive cells. Our finding suggests that products from bacteria today can still chime in the communication between mitochondria in our cells. We think that this type of communication is very important and here we have provided the first evidence of this. Fully understanding microbe-mitochondria communication can help us understand at a deeper level the interactions between microbes and their hosts.&quot;</p>

<li>“paradoxic” increase of virulence in diverse population versus “pure” population</li>
<li>Existing theory, empirical, clinical and field research all predict that reducing the virulence of individuals within a pathogen population will reduce the overall virulence, rendering disease less severe. Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <em>Magnaporthe oryzae</em>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <em>M. oryzae</em> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy.</li>

<p>Through massive shotgun sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA from the blood of more than 1,000 independent samples, we identified hundreds of new bacteria and viruses which represent previously unidentified members of the human microbiome. Previous studies targeted specific niches such as feces, skin, or the oral cavity, whereas our approach of using blood effectively enables sampling of the entire body and reveals the colonization of niches which have been previously inaccessible. We were thus able to discover that the human body contains a vast and unexpected diversity of microbes, many of which have highly divergent relationships to the known tree of life.</p>
<p>Blood circulates throughout the human body and contains molecules drawn from virtually every tissue, including the microbes and viruses which colonize the body. Through massive shotgun sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA from the blood, we identified hundreds of new bacteria and viruses which represent previously unidentified members of the human microbiome. Analyzing cumulative sequence data from 1,351 blood samples collected from 188 patients enabled us to assemble 7,190 contiguous regions (contigs) larger than 1 kbp, of which 3,761 are novel with little or no sequence homology in any existing databases. The vast majority of these novel contigs possess coding sequences, and we have validated their existence both by finding their presence in independent experiments and by performing direct PCR amplification. When their nearest neighbors are located in the tree of life, many of the organisms represent entirely novel taxa, showing that microbial diversity within the human body is substantially broader than previously appreciated.</p>

<p>The microbiota regulates the circadian liver transcriptome and detoxification pattern</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota undergoes diurnal compositional and functional oscillations that affect metabolic homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which the rhythmic microbiota influences host circadian activity remain elusive. Using integrated multi-omics and imaging approaches, we demonstrate that the gut microbiota features oscillating biogeographical localization and metabolome patterns that determine the rhythmic exposure of the intestinal epithelium to different bacterial species and their metabolites over the course of a day. This diurnal microbial behavior drives, in turn, the global programming of the host circadian transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolite oscillations. Surprisingly, disruption of homeostatic microbiome rhythmicity not only abrogates normal chromatin and transcriptional oscillations of the host, but also incites genome-wide de novo oscillations in both intestine and liver, thereby impacting diurnal fluctuations of host physiology and disease susceptibility. As such, the rhythmic biogeography and metabolome of the intestinal microbiota regulates the temporal organization and functional outcome of host transcriptional and epigenetic programs.</p>

<li>In wild primates, social behaviour influences exposure to environmentally acquired and directly transmitted microorganisms. Prior studies indicate that gut microbiota reflect pairwise social interactions among chimpanzee and baboon hosts. Here, we demonstrate that higher-order social network structure—beyond just pairwise interactions—drives gut bacterial composition in wild lemurs, which live in smaller and more cohesive groups than previously studied anthropoid species. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and social network analysis of grooming contacts, we estimate the relative impacts of hierarchical (i.e. multilevel) social structure, individual demographic traits, diet, scent-marking, and habitat overlap on bacteria acquisition in a wild population of Verreaux’s sifaka (<em>Propithecus verreauxi</em>) consisting of seven social groups. We show that social group membership is clearly reflected in the microbiomes of individual sifaka, and that social groups with denser grooming networks have more homogeneous gut microbial compositions. Within social groups, adults, more gregarious individuals, and individuals that scent-mark frequently harbour the greatest microbial diversity. Thus, the community structure of wild lemurs governs symbiotic relationships by constraining transmission between hosts and partitioning environmental exposure to microorganisms. This social cultivation of mutualistic gut flora may be an evolutionary benefit of tight-knit group living.</li>

<li>The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM.</li>

<li>The recently discovered histone post-translational modification crotonylation connects cellular metabolism to gene regulation. Its regulation and tissue-specific functions are poorly understood. We characterize histone crotonylation in intestinal epithelia and find that histone H3 crotonylation at lysine 18 is a surprisingly abundant modification in the small intestine crypt and colon, and is linked to gene regulation. We show that this modification is highly dynamic and regulated during the cell cycle. We identify class I histone deacetylases, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, as major executors of histone decrotonylation. We show that known HDAC inhibitors, including the gut microbiota-derived butyrate, affect histone decrotonylation. Consistent with this, we find that depletion of the gut microbiota leads to a global change in histone crotonylation in the colon. Our results suggest that histone crotonylation connects chromatin to the gut microbiota, at least in part, via short-chain fatty acids and HDACs.</li>

<p>The gut microbiota are implicated causally in essential hypertension.<br />
A proposed mechanism of essential hypertension is production of endogenous of glycerrhetinic acid-like factors (GALFs)<br />
GALFs act as competitive inhibitors of renal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.<br />
Gut bacteria are capable of converting host glucocorticoids into GALFs.</p>
<p>A new concept is emerging in biomedical sciences: the gut microbiota is a virtual ‘organ’ with endocrine function. Here, we explore the literature pertaining to the role of gut microbial metabolism of endogenous adrenocorticosteroids as a contributing factor in the etiology of essential hypertension. A body of literature demonstrates that bacterial products of glucocorticoid metabolism are absorbed into the portal circulation, and pass through the kidney before excretion into urine. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) syndrome patients were found to have congenital mutations resulting in non-functional renal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2) and severe hypertension often lethal in childhood. 11β-HSD2 acts as a “guardian” enzyme protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from excess cortisol, preventing sodium and water retention in the normotensive state. Licorice root, whose active ingredient, glycerrhetinic acid (GA), inhibits renal 11β-HSD2, and thereby causes hypertension in some individuals. Bacterially derived glucocorticoid metabolites may cause hypertension in some patients by a similar mechanism. Parallel observations in gut microbiology coupled with screening of endogenous steroids as inhibitors of 11β-HSD2 have implicated particular gut bacteria in essential hypertension through the production of glycerrhetinic acid-like factors (GALFs). A protective role of GALFs produced by gut bacteria in the etiology of colorectal cancer is also explored.</p>

<p>Microbial symbionts can modulate host interactions with biotic and abiotic factors. Such interactions may affect the evolutionary trajectories of both host and symbiont. Wolbachia protects Drosophila melanogaster against several viral infections and the strength of the protection varies between variants of this endosymbiont. Since Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, its fitness depends on the fitness of its host. Therefore, Wolbachia populations may be under selection when Drosophila is subjected to viral infection. Here we show that in D. melanogaster populations selected for increased survival upon infection with Drosophila C virus there is a strong selection coefficient for specific Wolbachia variants, leading to their fixation. Flies carrying these selected Wolbachia variants have higher survival and fertility upon viral infection when compared to flies with the other variants. These findings demonstrate how the interaction of a host with pathogens shapes the genetic composition of symbiont populations. Furthermore, host adaptation can result from the evolution of its symbionts, with host and symbiont functioning as a single evolutionary unit.</p>
<p>Author Summary</p>
<p>Animals live in close association with microbial partners that can shape many aspects of their lives. For instance, several insects carry bacteria that defend them against parasites and infectious diseases. The intracellular bacterium Wolbachia protects the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster against viral infection. Natural populations of Drosophila carry different variants of Wolbachia, which differ from one another in the strength of this protection. Here we show that a population of Drosophila infected with viruses during several generations adapts to this challenge through turnover in Wolbachia composition. The Wolbachia variants that give higher protection to viruses, by increasing fly survival and fecundity upon infection, are strongly selected. This work demonstrates that the interaction of an animal with a pathogen can shape its associated microbial populations. We show that adaptation to pathogens can be achieved not only through selection of resistance on the host proper but also through the evolutionary shaping of its microbial community.</p>

<li>The metabolism of carbohydrate polymers drives microbial diversity in the human gut microbiota. It is unclear, however, whether bacterial consortia or single organisms are required to depolymerize highly complex glycans. Here we show that the gut bacterium <em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em> uses the most structurally complex glycan known: the plant pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II, cleaving all but 1 of its 21 distinct glycosidic linkages. The deconstruction of rhamnogalacturonan-II side chains and backbone are coordinated to overcome steric constraints, and the degradation involves previously undiscovered enzyme families and catalytic activities. The degradation system informs revision of the current structural model of rhamnogalacturonan-II and highlights how individual gut bacteria orchestrate manifold enzymes to metabolize the most challenging glycan in the human diet.</li>

<li>Staphylococcus aureus–human interactions result in a continuum of outcomes from commensalism to pathogenesis. S. aureus is a clinically important pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes ~25% of humans as a member of the nostril and skin microbiota, where it resides with other bacteria including commensal Corynebacterium species. Commensal Corynebacterium spp. are also positively correlated with S. aureus in chronic polymicrobial diabetic foot infections, distinct from acute monomicrobial S. aureus infections. Recent work by our lab and others indicates that microbe–microbe interactions between S. aureus and human skin/nasal commensals, including Corynebacterium species, affect S. aureus behavior and fitness. Thus, we hypothesized that S. aureus interactions with Corynebacterium spp. diminish S. aureus virulence. We tested this by assaying for changes in S. aureus gene expression during in vitro mono- versus coculture with Corynebacterium striatum, a common skin and nasal commensal. We observed a broad shift in S. aureus gene transcription during in vitro growth with C. striatum, including increased transcription of genes known to exhibit increased expression during human nasal colonization and decreased transcription of virulence genes. S. aureus uses several regulatory pathways to transition between commensal and pathogenic states. One of these, the quorum signal accessory gene regulator (agr) system, was strongly inhibited in response to Corynebacterium spp. Phenotypically, S. aureus exposed to C. striatum exhibited increased adhesion to epithelial cells, reflecting a commensal state, and decreased hemolysin activity, reflecting an attenuation of virulence. Consistent with this, S. aureus displayed diminished fitness in experimental in vivo coinfection with C. striatum when compared to monoinfection. These data support a model in which S. aureus shifts from virulence toward a commensal state when exposed to commensal Corynebacterium species.</li>

<li>Cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system regulates host metabolism, and its dysregulation can cause metabolic disease. Here, we show that the gut microbe <em>Akkermansia muciniphila</em> can mediate negative effects of IFNγ on glucose tolerance. In IFNγ-deficient mice, <em>A. muciniphila</em> is significantly increased and restoration of IFNγ levels reduces <em>A. muciniphila</em> abundance. We further show that IFNγ-knockout mice whose microbiota does not contain <em>A. muciniphila</em> do not show improvement in glucose tolerance and adding back <em>A. muciniphila</em> promoted enhanced glucose tolerance. We go on to identify Irgm1 as an IFNγ-regulated gene in the mouse ileum that controls gut <em>A. muciniphila</em> levels. <em>A. muciniphila</em> is also linked to IFNγ-regulated gene expression in the intestine and glucose parameters in humans, suggesting that this trialogue between IFNγ, <em>A. muciniphila</em> and glucose tolerance might be an evolutionally conserved mechanism regulating metabolic health in mice and humans.</li>

<p>Histone-modifying enzymes regulate transcription and are sensitive to availability of endogenous small-molecule metabolites, allowing chromatin to respond to changes in environment. The gut microbiota produces a myriad of metabolites that affect host physiology and susceptibility to disease; however, the underlying molecular events remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that microbial colonization regulates global histone acetylation and methylation in multiple host tissues in a diet-dependent manner: consumption of a “Western-type” diet prevents many of the microbiota-dependent chromatin changes that occur in a polysaccharide-rich diet. Finally, we demonstrate that supplementation of germ-free mice with short-chain fatty acids, major products of gut bacterial fermentation, is sufficient to recapitulate chromatin modification states and transcriptional responses associated with colonization. These findings have profound implications for understanding the complex functional interactions between diet, gut microbiota, and host health.</p>

<li>TLR2 is a microbiota recognition receptor that has been described to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and to ameliorate inflammatory intestinal injury. In this context, serotonin (5-HT) has shown to be an essential intestinal physiological neuromodulator that is also involved in intestinal inflammatory diseases. Since the interaction between TLR2 activation and the intestinal serotoninergic system remains non-investigated, our main aim was to analyze the effect of TLR2 on intestinal serotonin transporter (SERT) activity and expression and the intracellular pathways involved. Caco-2/TC7 cells were used to analyze SERT and TLR2 molecular expression and SERT activity by measuring 5-HT uptake. The results showed that apical TLR2 activation inhibits SERT activity in Caco-2/TC7 cells mainly by reducing SERT protein level either in the plasma membrane, after short-term TLR2 activation or in both the plasma membrane and cell lysate, after long-term activation. cAMP/PKA pathway appears to mediate short-term inhibitory effect of TLR2 on SERT; however, p38 MAPK pathway has been shown to be involved in both short- and long-term TLR2 effect. Reciprocally, 5-HT long-term treatment yielded TLR2 down regulation in Caco-2/TC7 cells. Finally, results from <em>in vivo</em> showed an augmented intestinal SERT expression in mice <em>Tlr2-/-</em>, thus confirming our inhibitory effect of TLR2 on intestinal SERT <em>in vitro</em>. The present work infers that TLR2 may act in intestinal pathophysiology, not only by its inherent innate immune role, but also by regulating the intestinal serotoninergic system.</li>

<li>The human skin microbiome acts as an important barrier protecting our body from pathogens and other environmental influences. Recent investigations have provided evidence that Archaea are a constant but highly variable component of the human skin microbiome, yet factors that determine their abundance changes are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the abundance of archaea on human skin is influenced by human age and skin physiology by quantitative PCR of 51 different skin samples taken from human subjects of various age. Our results reveal that archaea are more abundant in human subjects either older than 60 years or younger than 12 years as compared to middle-aged human subjects. These results, together with results obtained from spectroscopy analysis, allowed us gain first insights into a potential link of lower sebum levels and lipid content and thus reduced skin moisture with an increase in archaeal signatures. Amplicon sequencing of selected samples revealed the prevalence of specific eury- and mainly thaumarchaeal taxa, represented by a core archaeome of the human skin.</li>

<li>We report the discovery that strains of <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> produce 6-<em>N</em>-hydroxyaminopurine (6-HAP), a molecule that inhibits DNA polymerase activity. In culture, 6-HAP selectively inhibited proliferation of tumor lines but did not inhibit primary keratinocytes. Resistance to 6-HAP was associated with the expression of mitochondrial amidoxime reducing components, enzymes that were not observed in cells sensitive to this compound. Intravenous injection of 6-HAP in mice suppressed the growth of B16F10 melanoma without evidence of systemic toxicity. Colonization of mice with an <em>S. epidermidis</em> strain producing 6-HAP reduced the incidence of ultraviolet-induced tumors compared to mice colonized by a control strain that did not produce 6-HAP. <em>S. epidermidis</em> strains producing 6-HAP were found in the metagenome from multiple healthy human subjects, suggesting that the microbiome of some individuals may confer protection against skin cancer. These findings show a new role for skin commensal bacteria in host defense.</li>

<p>Host-associated bacterial communities vary extensively between individuals, but it can be very difficult to determine the sources of this heterogeneity. Here, we demonstrate that stochastic bacterial community assembly in the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> intestine is sufficient to produce strong interworm heterogeneity in community composition. When worms are fed with two neutrally competing, fluorescently labeled bacterial strains, we observe stochastically driven bimodality in community composition, in which approximately half of the worms are dominated by each bacterial strain. A simple model incorporating stochastic colonization suggests that heterogeneity between worms is driven by the low rate at which bacteria successfully establish new intestinal colonies. We can increase this rate experimentally by feeding worms at high bacterial density; in these conditions, the bimodality disappears. These results demonstrate that demographic noise is a potentially important driver of diversity in bacterial community formation and suggest a role for <em>C</em>. <em>elegans</em> as a model system for ecology of host-associated communities.<br />
Author summary<br />
Host-associated bacterial communities—also known as microbiomes—vary extensively between individuals, even among clones exposed to the same environment. The sources of this variation are not entirely understood and can be very difficult to determine. In this manuscript, we demonstrate experimentally how randomness in bacterial colonization can result in large differences in the composition of host-associated bacterial communities, using the nematode worm <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> as a tractable host model. We find that the amount of variation between individual communities is a function of two rates relevant to how bacteria colonize the host intestine: the colonization rate and the birth rate. We can manipulate the degree of variation between communities by altering the colonization rate, using the amount of bacteria presented to the worms to control the rate at which migrants enter the intestine. When worms are fed with two neutrally competing, fluorescently labeled bacterial strains at low colonization rates, we are able to produce noise-induced bistability in this system, in which each community is dominated by bacteria of only one color. These results demonstrate the potential importance of noise and randomness as a driver of variation between communities and highlight the utility of the simple model organism <em>C</em>. <em>elegans</em> for studying questions relevant to host-associated microbial communities.</p>

<p>•The innate immune deficiency (IMD) pathway regulates tachykinin transcription<br />
•Microbial activation of enteroendocrine IMD signaling mediates metabolic homeostasis<br />
•Acetate restores IMD pathway activation and metabolic homeostasis in axenic flies<br />
•Acetate signaling through IMD depends on the membrane-associated receptor PGRP-LC</p>
<p>Enteroendocrine cells (EEs) are interspersed between enterocytes and stem cells in the Drosophila intestinal epithelium. Like enterocytes, EEs express components of the immune deficiency (IMD) innate immune pathway, which activates transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. The discovery of large lipid droplets in intestines of IMD pathway mutants prompted us to investigate the role of the IMD pathway in the host metabolic response to its intestinal microbiota. Here we provide evidence that the short-chain fatty acid acetate is a microbial metabolic signal that activates signaling through the enteroendocrine IMD pathway in a PGRP-LC-dependent manner. This, in turn, increases transcription of the gene encoding the endocrine peptide Tachykinin (Tk), which is essential for timely larval development and optimal lipid metabolism and insulin signaling. Our findings suggest innate immune pathways not only provide the first line of defense against infection but also afford the intestinal microbiota control over host development and metabolism.</p>

<li>Exercise is associated with altered gut microbial composition, but studies have not investigated whether the gut microbiota and associated metabolites are modulated by exercise training in humans. We explored the impact of six weeks of endurance exercise on the composition, functional capacity, and metabolic output of the gut microbiota in lean and obese adults with multiple-day dietary controls prior to outcome variable collection.<br />
METHODS<br />
Thirty-two lean (n=18 [9 female]) and obese (n=14 [11 female]), previously sedentary subjects participated in six weeks of supervised, endurance-based exercise training (3 days/wk) that progressed from 30 to 60 minutes/day and from moderate (60% of heart rate reserve [HRR]) to vigorous intensity (75% HRR). Subsequently, participants subsequently returned to a sedentary lifestyle activity for a six week washout period. Fecal samples were collected before and after six weeks of exercise, as well as after the sedentary washout period, with 3-day dietary controls in place prior to each collection.<br />
RESULTS<br />
β-diversity analysis revealed that exercise-induced alterations of the gut microbiota were dependent on obesity status. Exercise increased fecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in lean, but not obese, participants. Exercise-induced shifts in metabolic output of the microbiota paralleled changes in bacterial genes and taxa capable of SCFA production. Lastly, exercise-induced changes in the microbiota were largely reversed once exercise training ceased.<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
These findings suggest that exercise training induces compositional and functional changes in the human gut microbiota that are dependent on obesity status, independent of diet and contingent on the sustainment of exercise.</li>

<p>•Non-classical MHC class I molecules promote homeostatic immunity to the microbiota<br />
•Commensal-specific T cells express immunoregulatory and tissue repair signatures<br />
•Commensal-specific T cells accelerate wound closure</p>
<p>Mammalian barrier surfaces are constitutively colonized by numerous microorganisms. We explored how the microbiota was sensed by the immune system and the defining properties of such responses. Here, we show that a skin commensal can induce T cell responses in a manner that is restricted to non-classical MHC class I molecules. These responses are uncoupled from inflammation and highly distinct from pathogen-induced cells. Commensal-specific T cells express a defined gene signature that is characterized by expression of effector genes together with immunoregulatory and tissue-repair signatures. As such, non-classical MHCI-restricted commensal-specific immune responses not only promoted protection to pathogens, but also accelerated skin wound closure. Thus, the microbiota can induce a highly physiological and pleiotropic form of adaptive immunity that couples antimicrobial function with tissue repair. Our work also reveals that non-classical MHC class I molecules, an evolutionarily ancient arm of the immune system, can promote homeostatic immunity to the microbiota.</p>

<li>we identified 2 gut microbial-host co-metabolites associated with BP: phenylacetylglutamine and 4-cresyl sulfate, deriving from phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively, resulting from bacterial putrefaction of protein in the distal colon. The gut microbiota, in particular <em>Firmicutes</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, can adapt to dietary changes and induce changes in host metabolism (35): an increase of <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> ratio has been demonstrated in spontaneous hypertensive rats (36). Other researchers have manipulated gut microbiota balance via probiotic administration with consequent beneficial effects on BP levels (37). More recently, blood concentrations of phenylacetylglutamine were found to be strongly anti-correlated with BP, consistent with our results, and with carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity, a measure of aortic stiffness (38). Although 4-cresyl sulfate has never been formally linked to BP, its dietary excretion has been shown to be highly correlated with that of phenylacetylglutamine (16).</li>
<li>The association between gut-microbial co-metabolites and BP is further evidenced in the direct association we found between BP and hippurate, originating from the conversion of benzoic acid by gut microflora via the shikimate pathway (39). In contrast to our results, hypertensive rats showed an anti-correlation between hippurate and BP (40) but interpolation from animal data to human must be performed with care due to the differences in gut microbiomes between species. An inverse association between excretion of hippurate and BP has been reported in humans but this association was not significant after adjusting for BMI, alcohol intake, and urinary excretion of sodium and potassium (41). A controlled feeding study by Wu et al. (35) showed that changes in the gut microbiome occurred within 24 h of initiating a change in diet and that BMI and weight loss can also influence the gut microbiome composition. However, in our dietary intervention study, all participants consumed a consistent healthy dietary pattern for 6 wk and maintained their body weight, with micronutrients being indexed to the energy level of their diets. Our data, therefore, suggest modulation of diets can affect gut microbiome activity and that this may lead to a direct effect on BP regulation.</li>
<li>We observed an inverse association of <em>N</em>-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (tryptophan–NAD metabolite) and BP. Bartus et al. (42) showed that ingestion of 1*-<em>methylnicotinamide in hypertriglyceridemic rats resulted in an increase of 1</em>-<em>methylnicotinamide and its metabolites such as <em>N</em>-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and found that ingestion of 1</em>-<em>methylnicotinamide in both the diabetic and hypertriglyceridemic rats can ameliorate the nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation, a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis. Others have found that 1</em>-*methylnicotinamide demonstrates anti-thrombotic activity (43). Our findings further support the beneficial impact of <em>N</em>-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide on CVD health. We suggest the tryptophan–NAD pathway may offer a new target for pharmacological treatment of hypertension.</li>
<li>We also confirmed the association of dietary markers with BP including: a direct association between BP and carnitine (a marker for protein ingestion); and an inverse association with proline-betaine (citrus fruit ingestion). Our results are consistent with previous studies linking hypertension with blood concentration of carnitine (44) and variations in BP following carnitine treatment in rats (45). Similarly our results support the previously postulated benefit of citrus fruit intake in reduction of BP (34). Specifically for the OmniProt diet, despite the increased excretion of carnitine, a marker which was linked to higher BP, overall beneficial reductions in CVD risk factors (both BP levels and lipid profiles) were elicited and these benefits persisted for those who were considered as typical (HDR) as well as variable (VDR) responders. The specific mechanisms for this remain unclear although it may be hypothesized that the altered large-bowel microbiome following protein-rich dietary intervention may play a significant role.</li>

<ul>
<li>very basic first study to reveal changes in gut microbiota due to changes in sleep regime
<ul>
<li>Objective: Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been proposed to promote metabolic disturbances that also occur after short periods of sleep loss (including insulin resistance). However, whether sleep loss affects the gut microbiota remains unknown.<br />
Methods: In a randomized within-subject crossover study utilizing a standardized in-lab protocol (with fixed meal times and exercise schedules), we studied nine normal-weight men at two occasions: after two nights of partial sleep deprivation (PSD; sleep opportunity 02:45-07:00h), and after two nights of normal sleep (NS; sleep opportunity 22:30-07:00h). Fecal samples were collected within 24 hours before, and after two in-lab nights, of either NS or PSD. In addition, participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test following each sleep intervention.<br />
Results: Microbiota composition analysis (V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that after two days of PSD vs. after two days of NS, individuals exhibited an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and of the families Coriobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, with decreases in Tenericutes (all P&lt;0.05) – previously all associated with metabolic perturbations in animal or human models. However, no PSD vs. NS effect on beta diversity or on fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations was found. Fasting and postprandial insulin sensitivity decreased after PSD (all P&lt;0.05).<br />
Discussion: Our findings demonstrate that short-term sleep loss induces subtle effects on human microbiota. To what extent changes to the microbial community contribute to metabolic consequences of sleep loss warrants further investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep studies, to also assess how sleep loss impacts the microbiota in individuals who already are metabolically compromised.</li>

<p><em>microbial regulation of microrna expression in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex</em><br />

<li>One of the most exciting findings in the past decade in relation to psychiatric disorders has been the discovery that the gut microbiota may act as a key regulator of the brain and behaviour [1, 2, 3]. Proof-of-principal experiments using microbiota-deficient or germ-free (GF) rodents have been extremely useful in investigating the impact of the absence of the gut microbiota on brain development and behaviour <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18678">4</a>, especially regarding the ability of the gut microbiota to influence normal anxiety and fear behaviours [5, 6, 7]. GF animals not only display changes in basal anxiety but also have deficits in sociability, cognition and increased depressive-like behaviours [8, 9, 10]. Some studies that use antibiotic exposure in order to deplete the gut microbiota have also shown similarly altered behavioural phenotypes [11, 12, 13]. Preclinical evidence also highlights that certain probiotics and prebiotics have anxiolytic-like activity [14, 15] which highlights the potential of microbiota-mediated therapeutic approaches for treating anxiety-related disorders.<br />
The most reproducible finding with regard to behavioural effects in rodent models of microbial disturbances is a marked influence on anxiety-related behaviours <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18678">4</a>. The neural systems that govern such behaviours are complex, with an array of brain regions that interconnect in order to process emotional stimuli and allow for appropriate responses <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13329#ref25">16</a>. Specifically, the amygdala and PFC are key loci that control anxiety and the response to fearful stimuli <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13329#ref26">17</a>. Both regions display abnormalities in GF animals including hypermyelination in the PFC <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13329#ref27">18</a>, altered morphology of the amygdala <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.10.25">19</a> and impaired amygdala-dependent fear memory recall <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.003">7</a>. A large body of evidence implicates dysfunction of the neural circuits connecting these two brain regions in the pathophysiology of fear- and anxiety-like disorders [20, 21].<br />
Over the past few years, attempts to understand the mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders have focused attention on the role of miRNAs <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000633">22</a>. miRNAs are an expanding class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs, which function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, primarily through translational repression. It has been demonstrated that brain-specific miRNA candidates within the amygdala and PFC regulate anxiety- and fear-related behaviours in mice [23, 24, 25, 26].<br />
We have previously shown that the absence of microbial exposure throughout life results in altered transcriptional regulation in both the amygdala and PFC [18, 27]. We therefore hypothesized that alterations in miRNA expression may be associated with some of the noted molecular changes in these animals. To this end, we used a number of complementary approaches. Firstly, we conducted unbiased Illumina® NGS for miRNAs in the amygdala and PFC of conventionally raised (CON), GF and colonized GF mice (exGF) to investigate whether miRNA expression can be influenced by the gut microbiota. To delineate specific miRNAs that may be influenced by the gut microbiota during adulthood following normal assembly patterns in early life, we then examined miRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult rodents following sustained microbiota knockdown with antibiotics. We hypothesized that there would be extensive reorganization of miRNA expression in these two key brain regions (amygdala and PFC) of microbiota-deficient rodents.</li>

<li>Microglia and astrocytes modulate inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia modulate pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic activities in astrocytes, but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood. Here we report that TGFα and VEGF-B produced by microglia regulate the pathogenic activities of astrocytes in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Microglia-derived TGFα acts via the ErbB1 receptor in astrocytes to limit their pathogenic activities and EAE development. Conversely, microglial VEGF-B triggers FLT-1 signalling in astrocytes and worsens EAE. VEGF-B and TGFα also participate in the microglial control of human astrocytes. Furthermore, expression of TGFα and VEGF-B in CD14+ cells correlates with the multiple sclerosis lesion stage. Finally, metabolites of dietary tryptophan produced by the commensal flora control microglial activation and TGFα and VEGF-B production, modulating the transcriptional program of astrocytes and CNS inflammation through a mechanism mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In summary, we identified positive and negative regulators that mediate the microglial control of astrocytes. Moreover, these findings define a pathway through which microbial metabolites limit pathogenic activities of microglia and astrocytes, and suppress CNS inflammation. This pathway may guide new therapies for multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.</li>

gMacs support enteric neurons and submucosal vasculature<br />
Loss of gMacs results in vascular leakage, reduced intestinal secretion, and transit</p>
<p>Macrophages are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident immune cells that perform a variety of tissue-supportive functions. The current paradigm dictates that intestinal macrophages are continuously replaced by incoming monocytes that acquire a pro-inflammatory or tissue-protective signature. Here, we identify a self-maintaining population of macrophages that arise from both embryonic precursors and adult bone marrow-derived monocytes and persists throughout adulthood. Gene expression and imaging studies of self-maintaining macrophages revealed distinct transcriptional profiles that reflect their unique localization (i.e., closely positioned to blood vessels, submucosal and myenteric plexus, Paneth cells, and Peyer’s patches). Depletion of self-maintaining macrophages resulted in morphological abnormalities in the submucosal vasculature and loss of enteric neurons, leading to vascular leakage, impaired secretion, and reduced intestinal motility. These results provide critical insights in intestinal macrophage heterogeneity and demonstrate the strategic role of self-maintaining macrophages in gut homeostasis and intestinal physiology.</p>

<li>Recent studies suggest that autism is often associated with dysregulated immune responses and altered microbiota composition. This has led to growing speculation about potential roles for hyperactive immune responses and the microbiome in autism. Yet how microbiome–immune cross-talk contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders currently remains poorly understood. In this study, we report critical roles for prenatal microbiota composition in the development of behavioral abnormalities in a murine maternal immune activation (MIA) model of autism that is driven by the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. We show that preconception microbiota transplantation can transfer susceptibility to MIA-associated neurodevelopmental disease and that this is associated with modulation of the maternal immune response. Furthermore, we find that ablation of IL-17a signaling provides protection against the development of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in MIA offspring. Our findings suggest that microbiota landscape can influence MIA-induced neurodevelopmental disease pathogenesis and that this occurs as a result of microflora-associated calibration of gestational IL-17a responses.</li>

<li>Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a common comorbidity in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Many studies have shown alterations in the composition of the fecal flora and metabolic products of the gut microbiome in patients with ASD. The gut microbiota influences brain development and behaviors through the neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and autonomic nervous systems. In addition, an abnormal gut microbiota is associated with several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ASD and mood disorders. Here, we review the bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract (brain-gut axis) and the role of the gut microbiota in the central nervous system (CNS) and ASD. Microbiome-mediated therapies might be a safe and effective treatment for ASD.</li>

<li>Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds.</li>

<li>Alterations of pulmonary microbiome have been recognized in multiple respiratory disorders. It is critically important to ascertain if an airway microbiome exists at birth and if so, whether it is associated with subsequent lung disease. We found an established diverse and similar airway microbiome at birth in both preterm and term infants, which was more diverse and different from that of older preterm infants with established chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Consistent temporal dysbiotic changes in the airway microbiome were seen from birth to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants. Genus Lactobacillus was decreased at birth in infants with chorioamnionitis and in preterm infants who subsequently went on to develop lung disease. Our results, taken together with previous literature indicating a placental and amniotic fluid microbiome, suggest fetal acquisition of an airway microbiome. We speculate that the early airway microbiome may prime the developing pulmonary immune system, and dysbiosis in its development may set the stage for subsequent lung disease.</li>

<li>Living in a microbe-rich environment reduces the risk of developing asthma. Exposure of humans or mice to unmethylated CpG DNA (CpG) from bacteria reproduces these protective effects, suggesting a major contribution of CpG to microbe-induced asthma resistance. However, how CpG confers protection remains elusive. We found that exposure to CpG expanded regulatory lung interstitial macrophages (IMs) from monocytes infiltrating the lung or mobilized from the spleen. Trafficking of IM precursors to the lung was independent of CCR2, a chemokine receptor required for monocyte mobilization from the bone marrow. Using a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, we found that adoptive transfer of IMs isolated from CpG-treated mice recapitulated the protective effects of CpG when administered before allergen sensitization or challenge. IM-mediated protection was dependent on IL-10, given that <em>Il10−/−</em> CpG-induced IMs lacked regulatory effects. Thus, the expansion of regulatory lung IMs upon exposure to CpG might underlie the reduced risk of asthma development associated with a microbe-rich environment.</li>

<li>Asthma during pregnancy is associated with retardation of fetal growth in a sex-specific manner. Lactobacilli microbes influence infant growth. This study aimed to determine whether lactobacilli and other microbes are reduced in the gut of infants born to an asthmatic mother, and whether this differs by the sex of the infant.<br />
Mother-infant pairs (N=1021) from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development full-term cohort were studied. The abundance of infant faecal microbiota at 3–4 months, profiled by gene sequencing, was compared between both women with and without asthma treatment during pregnancy. Infant sex, maternal ethnicity, pre-pregnancy overweight and atopy status, birth mode, breastfeeding status and intrapartum antibiotic treatment were tested as covariates.<br />
Independent of birth mode and other covariates, male, Caucasian infants born to women with prenatal asthma harboured fewer lactobacilli in the gut at 3–4 months of age. If asthmatic mothers had pre-pregnancy overweight, the abundance of <em>Lactobacillus</em> in males was further reduced in the infant gut, whereas the microbiota of female infants was enriched with <em>Bacteroidaceae</em>. Similar differences in infant gut microbial composition according to maternal prenatal asthma status were also more evident among women with food or environmental allergies.<br />
Gut lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants, but <em>Bacteroidaceae</em> were more abundant in female infants at 3–4 months of age, following maternal asthma during pregnancy.</li>

<li>A dynamic relationship between the gut microbiota and brain is pivotal in neonatal development. Dysbiosis of the microbiome may result in altered neurodevelopment; however, it is unclear which specific members of microbiota are most influential and what factors might mediate the relationship between the gut and the brain. Twenty-four vaginally-derived male piglets were subjected to magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 30 d of age. Ascending colon contents, feces, and blood were collected and analyzed for volatile fatty acids, microbiota relative abundance by 16s rRNA, and serum metabolites, respectively. A mediation analysis was performed to assess the mediatory effect of serum biomarkers on the relationship between microbiota and neurometabolites. Results indicated fecal <em>Ruminococcus</em> and <em>Butyricimonas</em> predicted brain N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Analysis of serum biomarkers indicated <em>Ruminococcus</em> independently predicted serum serotonin and cortisol. A 3-step mediation indicated: i) <em>Ruminococcus</em> negatively predicted NAA, ii) <em>Ruminococcus</em> negatively predicted cortisol, and iii) a significant indirect effect (i.e., the effect of fecal <em>Ruminococcus</em> through cortisol on NAA) was observed and the direct effect became insignificant. Thus, serum cortisol fully mediated the relationship between fecal <em>Ruminococcus</em> and brain NAA. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this study used a statistical mediation analysis and provides a novel perspective into the potential underlying mechanisms through which the microbiota may shape brain development. This is the first study to link <em>Ruminococcus</em>, cortisol, and NAA <em>in vivo</em>, and these findings are substantiated by previous literature indicating these factors may be influential in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</li>

We found that L-threonine induces the bacterial production of the trail pheromone pyrazines, which are common for the host leaf-cutter ants. Isotope feeding experiments revealed that L-threonine along with sodium acetate were the biosynthetic precursors of these natural products and a biosynthetic pathway was proposed.</li>

•Knockdown of TRIM28 in hNPCs results in the upregulation of ERV expression<br />
•Protein-coding genes located near upregulated ERVs are upregulated</p>
<p>Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which make up 8% of the human genome, have been proposed to participate in the control of gene regulatory networks. In this study, we find a region- and developmental stage-specific expression pattern of ERVs in the developing human brain, which is linked to a transcriptional network based on ERVs. We demonstrate that almost 10,000, primarily primate-specific, ERVs act as docking platforms for the co-repressor protein TRIM28 in human neural progenitor cells, which results in the establishment of local heterochromatin. Thereby, TRIM28 represses ERVs and consequently regulates the expression of neighboring genes. These results uncover a gene regulatory network based on ERVs that participates in control of gene expression of protein-coding transcripts important for brain development.</p>

•Microbiota transplant from chow-fed mice prevents mucus aberrations in mice fed a WSD<br />
•Mucus aberrations can be prevented by <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em> and inulin treatment</p>
<p>Diet strongly affects gut microbiota composition, and gut bacteria can influence the colonic mucus layer, a physical barrier that separates trillions of gut bacteria from the host. However, the interplay between a Western style diet (WSD), gut microbiota composition, and the intestinal mucus layer is less clear. Here we show that mice fed a WSD have an altered colonic microbiota composition that causes increased penetrability and a reduced growth rate of the inner mucus layer. Both barrier defects can be prevented by transplanting microbiota from chow-fed mice. In addition, we found that administration of <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em> was sufficient to restore mucus growth, whereas administration of the fiber inulin prevented increased mucus penetrability in WSD-fed mice. We hypothesize that the presence of distinct bacteria is crucial for proper mucus function. If confirmed in humans, these findings may help to better understand diseases with an affected mucus layer, such as ulcerative colitis.</p>

<p>Dietary supplementation with fermentable fiber suppresses adiposity and the associated parameters of metabolic syndrome. Microbiota-generated fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and free fatty acid receptors including GPR43 are thought to mediate these effects. We find that while fermentable (inulin), but not insoluble (cellulose), fiber markedly protected mice against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome, the effect was not significantly impaired by either inhibiting SCFA production or genetic ablation of GPR43. Rather, HFD decimates gut microbiota, resulting in loss of enterocyte proliferation, leading to microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation (LGI), and metabolic syndrome. Enriching HFD with inulin restored microbiota loads, interleukin-22 (IL-22) production, enterocyte proliferation, and antimicrobial gene expression in a microbiota-dependent manner, as assessed by antibiotic and germ-free approaches. Inulin-induced IL-22 expression, which required innate lymphoid cells, prevented microbiota encroachment and protected against LGI and metabolic syndrome. Thus, fermentable fiber protects against metabolic syndrome by nourishing microbiota to restore IL-22-mediated enterocyte function.</p>

<li>Early life microbial colonization and succession is critically important to healthy development with impacts on metabolic and immunologic processes throughout life. A longitudinal prospective cohort was recruited from midwifery practices to include infants born at full term gestation to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Here we compare bacterial community succession in infants born vaginally, with no exposure to antibiotics (n = 53), with infants who were exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for Group B <em>Streptococcus</em> (GBS; n = 14), and infants born by C-section (n = 7). Molecular profiles  of the 16 S rRNA genes indicate that there is a delay in the expansion of <em>Bifidobacterium</em>, which was the dominate infant gut colonizer, over the first 12 weeks and a persistence of <em>Escherichia</em> when IAP for GBS exposure is present during vaginal labour. Longer duration of IAP exposure increased the magnitude of the effect on <em>Bifidobacterium</em> populations, suggesting a longer delay in microbial community maturation. As with prior studies, we found altered gut colonisation following C-section that included a notable lack of Bacteroidetes. This study found that exposure of infants to IAP for GBS during vaginal birth affected aspects of gut microbial ecology that, although dramatic at early time points, disappeared by 12 weeks of age in most infants.</li>

<ul>
<li>The nonribosomal enterotoxin tilivalline was the first naturally occurring pyrrolobenzodiazepine to be linked to disease in the human intestine. Since the producing organism <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em> is part of the intestinal microbiota and the pyrrolobenzodiazepine causes the pathogenesis of colitis it is important to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of tilivalline activity. Here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and show that this nonribosomal peptide assembly pathway initially generates tilimycin, a simple pyrrolobenzodiazepine with cytotoxic properties. Tilivalline results from the non-enzymatic spontaneous reaction of tilimycin with biogenetically generated indole. Through a chemical total synthesis of tilimycin we could corroborate the predictions made about the biosynthesis. Production of two cytotoxic pyrrolobenzodiazepines with distinct functionalities by human gut resident <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em> has important implications for intestinal disease.</li>
<li>The enteric bacterium <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em> presents a striking example.

Here, we examine the microbiome profile of 350 stool samples collected longitudinally for more than a year from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. The data reveal annual cyclic reconfiguration of the microbiome, in which some taxa become undetectable only to reappear in a subsequent season. Comparison of the Hadza data set with data collected from 18 populations in 16 countries with varying lifestyles reveals that gut community membership corresponds to modernization: Notably, the taxa within the Hadza that are the most seasonally volatile similarly differentiate industrialized and traditional populations. These data indicate that some dynamic lineages of microbes have decreased in prevalence and abundance in modernized populations.</li>

<ul>
<li>In nature microbial populations are subject to fluctuating nutrient levels. Nutrient fluctuations are important for evolutionary and ecological dynamics in microbial communities since they impact growth rates, population sizes, and biofilm formation. Here we use automated continuous-culture devices and high-throughput imaging to show that when populations of <em>Escherichia coli</em> are subjected to cycles of nutrient excess (feasts) and scarcity (famine) their abundance dynamics during famines depend on the frequency and amplitude of feasts. We show that frequency and amplitude dependent dynamics in planktonic populations arise from nutrient and history dependent rates of aggregation and dispersal. A phenomenological model recapitulates our experimental observations. Our results show that the statistical properties of environmental fluctuations have substantial impacts on spatial structure in bacterial populations driving large changes in abundance dynamics.</li>

<li>The microbiota of the aged is variously described as being more or less diverse than that of younger cohorts, but the comparison groups used and the definitions of the aged population differ between experiments. The differences are often described by null hypothesis statistical tests, which are notoriously irreproducible when dealing with large multivariate samples. We collected and examined the gut microbiota of a cross-sectional cohort of more than 1,000 very healthy Chinese individuals who spanned ages from 3 to over 100 years. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing results used a compositional data analysis paradigm coupled with measures of effect size, where ordination, differential abundance, and correlation can be explored and analyzed in a unified and reproducible framework. Our analysis showed several surprising results compared to other cohorts. First, the overall microbiota composition of the healthy aged group was similar to that of people decades younger. Second, the major differences between groups in the gut microbiota profiles were found before age 20. Third, the gut microbiota differed little between individuals from the ages of 30 to &gt;100. Fourth, the gut microbiota of males appeared to be more variable than that of females. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the microbiota of the healthy aged in this cross-sectional study differ little from that of the healthy young in the same population, although the minor variations that do exist depend upon the comparison cohort.</li>

<p>Because the children’s gut microbiota exhibited more plasticity, these results raise an interesting possibility that urban children who eat a more traditional, high-fiber, low-fat and low-processed diet early in life might cultivate a more diverse set of gut microbes. Conversely, adults may have a limited response due to their low microbiome plasticity.<br />
Dominguez-Bello was not terribly surprised that the adults’ gut and other microbiota changed so little: “If you take traditional people and bring them to New York, give them antibiotics and McDonald’s to eat everyday, it’s not surprising that they lose diversity,” she says. “But if, as an urban dweller, you’ve already lost that gut microbe diversity and you move to a high-diversity diet, maybe you cannot ‘bloom’ diversity because you simply don’t have those microbes present anymore.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People living traditional lifestyles have higher gut microbiota diversity than urban subjects. We hypothesized that shifting lifestyles from an urban environment to a traditional rainforest village would lead to changes in the microbiota of visitors, which would become more similar to the microbiota of villagers. Here, we characterized at different time points the microbiota of 7 urban visitors (5 adults and 2 children) staying in a rainforest Amerindian village for 16 days and compared them with a reference collection of samples from age-matched local villagers. We performed a 16S rRNA gene survey of samples from multiple body sites (including fecal, oral, nasal, and skin samples) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The main factor segregating the microbiotas of each body site was the human group (i.e., visitors versus villagers), with the visitor microbiota tending to have lower alpha diversity; the lowered alpha diversity was statistically significant in the microbiota of skin and in the children’s fecal and oral microbiota. During the rainforest period, all visitors experienced microbiota changes within their personal cloud of variation. For all body sites, the microbiota conformations in the visitor children better matched the microbiota conformations in villagers of the same age than did those of the visitor adults, which showed a lower “microbiota age” than the microbiota of the villagers. The results suggest higher stability in the adult microbiota, with the less resilient children’s microbiota responding more to dietary changes.</p>

•Most bacterial species are shared among PNG and the US, but abundance profiles differ<br />
•Impact of lifestyle on ecological assembly processes might explain these patterns<br />
•Westernization may decrease bacterial dispersal rates, altering microbiota structure</p>
<p>Although recent research revealed an impact of westernization on diversity and composition of the human gut microbiota, the exact consequences on metacommunity characteristics are insufficiently understood, and the underlying ecological mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we have compared the fecal microbiota of adults from two non-industrialized regions in Papua New Guinea (PNG) with that of United States (US) residents. Papua New Guineans harbor communities with greater bacterial diversity, lower inter-individual variation, vastly different abundance profiles, and bacterial lineages undetectable in US residents. A quantification of the ecological processes that govern community assembly identified bacterial dispersal as the dominant process that shapes the microbiome in PNG but not in the US. These findings suggest that the microbiome alterations detected in industrialized societies might arise from modern lifestyle factors limiting bacterial dispersal, which has implications for human health and the development of strategies aimed to redress the impact of westernization.</p>

<li>Edible insects are often considered a nutritious, protein-rich, environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional livestock with growing popularity among North American consumers. While the nutrient composition of several insects is characterized, all potential health impacts have not been evaluated. In addition to high protein levels, crickets contain chitin and other fibers that may influence gut health. In this study, we evaluated the effects of consuming 25 grams/day whole cricket powder on gut microbiota composition, while assessing safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults participated in this six-week, double-blind, crossover dietary intervention. Participants were randomized into two study arms and consumed either cricket-containing or control breakfast foods for 14 days, followed by a washout period and assignment to the opposite treatment. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment period to assess liver function and microbiota changes. Results demonstrate cricket consumption is tolerable and non-toxic at the studied dose. Cricket powder supported growth of the probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium animalis, which increased 5.7-fold. Cricket consumption was also associated with reduced plasma TNF-α. These data suggest that eating crickets may improve gut health and reduce systemic inflammation; however, more research is needed to understand these effects and underlying mechanisms.</li>

<li>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the common probiotics. Here, we investigated the antiviral protective effects of heat-killed LAB strain <em>Lactobacillus casei</em> DK128 (DK128) on influenza viruses. Intranasal treatment of mice with DK128 conferred protection against different subtypes of influenza viruses by lessening weight loss and lowering viral loads. Protection via heat-killed DK128 was correlated with an increase in alveolar macrophage cells in the lungs and airways, early induction of virus specific antibodies, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cells. Importantly, the mice that were protected against primary viral infection as a result of heat-killed DK128 pretreatment developed subsequent heterosubtypic immunity against secondary virus infection. For protection against influenza virus via heat-killed DK128 pretreatment, B cells and partially CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells were required as inferred from studies using knockout mouse models. Our study provides insight into how hosts can be equipped with innate and adaptive immunity via heat-killed DK128 treatment to protect against influenza virus, supporting that heat-killed LAB may be developed as anti-virus probiotics.</li>

<li>Mania is a serious neuropsychiatric condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested that environmental exposures can contribute to mania pathogenesis. We measured dietary exposures in a cohort of individuals with mania and other psychiatric disorders as well as in control individuals without a psychiatric disorder. We found that a history of eating nitrated dry cured meat but not other meat or fish products was strongly and independently associated with current mania (adjusted odds ratio 3.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24–5.45, p &lt; 8.97 × 10−8). Lower odds of association were found between eating nitrated dry cured meat and other psychiatric disorders. We further found that the feeding of meat preparations with added nitrate to rats resulted in hyperactivity reminiscent of human mania, alterations in brain pathways that have been implicated in human bipolar disorder, and changes in intestinal microbiota. These findings may lead to new methods for preventing mania and for developing novel therapeutic interventions.</li>

<li>Hepatic steatosis is a multifactorial condition that is often observed in obese patients and is a prelude to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we combine shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve = 87%) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome (&gt;75% shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies.</li>

•KD microbiota regulate amino acid γ-glutamylation and hippocampal GABA/glutamate</p>
<p>The ketogenic diet (KD) is used to treat refractory epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Here, we show that the gut microbiota is altered by the KD and required for protection against acute electrically induced seizures and spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures in two mouse models. Mice treated with antibiotics or reared germ free are resistant to KD-mediated seizure protection. Enrichment of, and gnotobiotic co-colonization with, KD-associated Akkermansia and Parabacteroides restores seizure protection. Moreover, transplantation of the KD gut microbiota and treatment with Akkermansia and Parabacteroides each confer seizure protection to mice fed a control diet. Alterations in colonic lumenal, serum, and hippocampal metabolomic profiles correlate with seizure protection, including reductions in systemic gamma-glutamylated amino acids and elevated hippocampal GABA/glutamate levels. Bacterial cross-feeding decreases gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity, and inhibiting gamma-glutamylation promotes seizure protection in vivo. Overall, this study reveals that the gut microbiota modulates host metabolism and seizure susceptibility in mice.</p>

<li>Dysbiosis of the gut facilitates chronic diseases such as cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Successful treatment may require restoration of functions performed by symbiotic microbes. The field of ecological restoration has restored species diversity and ecosystem function of natural habitats since the latter part of the 20th century, but its possible applications to medicine are unexplored. Here we show that approaches developed to restore natural ecosystems may aid in the treatment of chronic disease by helping to characterize target conditions for healthy microbe communities, by identifying the importance of donor diversity in fecal microbiota transplants, and by elevating the importance of diet, patient involvement, and personalized medicine in gut health. Dialogue between the fields of restoration ecology and medicine may help to guide future directions in gut research and clinical care.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite multiple associations between the microbiota and immune diseases, their role in autoimmunity is poorly understood. We found that translocation of a gut pathobiont, <em>Enterococcus gallinarum</em>, to the liver and other systemic tissues triggers autoimmune responses in a genetic background predisposing to autoimmunity. Antibiotic treatment prevented mortality in this model, suppressed growth of <em>E. gallinarum</em> in tissues, and eliminated pathogenic autoantibodies and T cells. Hepatocyte–<em>E. gallinarum</em> cocultures induced autoimmune-promoting factors. Pathobiont translocation in monocolonized and autoimmune-prone mice induced autoantibodies and caused mortality, which could be prevented by an intramuscular vaccine targeting the pathobiont. <em>E. gallinarum</em>–specific DNA was recovered from liver biopsies of autoimmune patients, and cocultures with human hepatocytes replicated the murine findings; hence, similar processes apparently occur in susceptible humans. These discoveries show that a gut pathobiont can translocate and promote autoimmunity in genetically predisposed hosts.</li>

<ul>
<li>Koalas (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>) are arboreal marsupials native to Australia that eat a specialized diet of almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves. Microbes in koala intestines are known to break down otherwise toxic compounds, such as tannins, in eucalyptus leaves. Infections by <em>Chlamydia</em>, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens, are highly prevalent in koala populations. If animals with <em>Chlamydia</em> infections are received by wildlife hospitals, a range of antibiotics can be used to treat them. However, previous studies suggested that koalas can suffer adverse side effects during antibiotic treatment. This study aimed to use 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from koala feces to characterize the intestinal microbiome of koalas throughout antibiotic treatment and identify specific taxa associated with koala health after treatment. Although differences in the alpha diversity were observed in the intestinal flora between treated and untreated koalas and between koalas treated with different antibiotics, these differences were not statistically significant. The alpha diversity of microbial communities from koalas that lived through antibiotic treatment versus those who did not was significantly greater, however. Beta diversity analysis largely confirmed the latter observation, revealing that the overall communities were different between koalas on antibiotics that died versus those that survived or never received antibiotics. Using both machine learning and OTU (operational taxonomic unit) co-occurrence network analyses, we found that OTUs that are very closely related to <em>Lonepinella koalarum</em>, a known tannin degrader found by culture-based methods to be present in koala intestines, was correlated with a koala’s health status. This is the first study to characterize the time course of effects of antibiotics on koala intestinal microbiomes. Our results suggest it may be useful to pursue alternative treatments for <em>Chlamydia</em> infections without the use of antibiotics or the development of <em>Chlamydia</em>-specific antimicrobial compounds that do not broadly affect microbial communities.</li>

<p><em>a causal mechanism for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</em><br />
mel greaves 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41568-018-0015-6">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41568-018-0015-6</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In this Review, I present evidence supporting a multifactorial causation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a major subtype of paediatric cancer. ALL evolves in two discrete steps. First, in utero initiation by fusion gene formation or hyperdiploidy generates a covert, pre-leukaemic clone. Second, in a small fraction of these cases, the postnatal acquisition of secondary genetic changes (primarily V(D)J recombination-activating protein (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-driven copy number alterations in the case of ETS translocation variant 6 (<em>ETV6</em>)–runt-related transcription factor 1 (<em>RUNX1</em>)+ ALL) drives conversion to overt leukaemia. Epidemiological and modelling studies endorse a dual role for common infections. Microbial exposures earlier in life are protective but, in their absence, later infections trigger the critical secondary mutations. Risk is further modified by inherited genetics, chance and, probably, diet. Childhood ALL can be viewed as a paradoxical consequence of progress in modern societies, where behavioural changes have restrained early microbial exposure. This engenders an evolutionary mismatch between historical adaptations of the immune system and contemporary lifestyles. Childhood ALL may be a preventable cancer.</li>

•Mice under germ-free conditions are protected from age-associated inflammation<br />
•Co-housing germ-free mice with old, but not young, mice increases age-related inflammation<br />
•Age-related microbiota changes can be reversed by reducing TNF levels</p>
<p>Levels of inflammatory mediators in circulation are known to increase with age, but the underlying cause of this age-associated inflammation is debated. We find that, when maintained under germ-free conditions, mice do not display an age-related increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. A higher proportion of germ-free mice live to 600 days than their conventional counterparts, and macrophages derived from aged germ-free mice maintain anti-microbial activity. Co-housing germ-free mice with old, but not young, conventionally raised mice increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. In tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficient mice, which are protected from age-associated inflammation, age-related microbiota changes are not observed. Furthermore, age-associated microbiota changes can be reversed by reducing TNF using anti-TNF therapy. These data suggest that aging-associated microbiota promote inflammation and that reversing these age-related microbiota changes represents a potential strategy for reducing age-associated inflammation and the accompanying morbidity.</p>

<li>The allergen Pru p 3, a peach lipid transfer protein, has been well studied. However, its physiological function remains to be elucidated. Our results showed that Pru p 3 usually carries a lipid ligand that play an essential role in its function in plants. Using ESI-qToF, we observed that the ligand was a derivative of camptothecin binding to phytosphingosine, wich that is inserted into the hydrophobic tunnel of the protein. In addition, the described ligand displayed topoisomerase I activity inhibition and self-fluorescence, both recognized as camptothecin properties. During flower development, the highest expression of <em>Pru p 3</em> was detected in the styles of pollinated flowers, in contrast to its non-expression in unpollinated pistils, where expression decreased after anthesis. During ripening, the expression of Pru p 3 were observed mainly in peel but not in pulp. In this sense, Pru p 3 protein was also localized in trichomes covering the fruit epidermis.</li>

<li>Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex collection of disorders. Microbial dysbiosis as well as exposure to toxins including xenoestrogens are thought to be risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease development and relapse. Bisphenol-A has been shown to exert estrogenic activity in the colon and alter intestinal function, but the role that xenoestrogens, such as bisphenol-A , play in colonic inflammation has been previously described but with conflicting results. We investigated the ability of bisphenol-A to exacerbate colonic inflammation and alter microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in an acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis model. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized and exposed to bisphenol-A daily for 15 days. Disease activity measures include body weight, fecal consistency, and rectal bleeding. Colons were scored for inflammation, injury, and nodularity. Alterations in the levels of microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids known to reflect phenotypic changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Bisphenol-A exposure increased mortality and worsened disease activity as well as inflammation and nodularity scores in the middle colon region following dextran sulfate sodium exposure. Unique patterns of metabolites were associated with bisphenol-A consumption. Regardless of dextran sulfate sodium treatment, bisphenol-A reduced levels of tryptophan and several metabolites associated with decreased inflammation in the colon. This is the first study to show that bisphenol-A treatment alone can reduce microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in the colon which may be associated with increased colonic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease.</li>

<li>Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup®, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise. Residues are found in the main foods of the Western diet, comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat. Glyphosate's inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Here, we show how interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We explain the documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and we show that glyphosate is the “textbook example” of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins.</li>

<p>Bactericidal antibiotics alter microbial metabolism as part of their lethality and can damage mitochondria in mammalian cells. In addition, antibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to extracellular metabolites, but it remains unknown whether metabolites present at an infection site can affect either treatment efficacy or immune function. Here, we quantify local metabolic changes in the host microenvironment following antibiotic treatment for a peritoneal <em>Escherichia coli</em> infection. Antibiotic treatment elicits microbiome-independent changes in local metabolites, but not those distal to the infection site, by acting directly on host cells. The metabolites induced during treatment, such as AMP, reduce antibiotic efficacy and enhance phagocytic killing. Moreover, antibiotic treatment impairs immune function by inhibiting respiratory activity in immune cells. Collectively, these results highlight the immunomodulatory potential of antibiotics and reveal the local metabolic microenvironment to be an important determinant of infection resolution.</p>

<p><em>the active component of aspirin, salicylic acid, promotes staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in a pia-dependent manner</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Aspirin has provided clear benefits to human health. But salicylic acid (SAL) -the main aspirin biometabolite- exerts several effects on eukaryote and prokaryote cells. SAL can affect, for instance, the expression of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> virulence factors. SAL can also form complexes with iron cations and it has been shown that different iron chelating molecules diminished the formation of <em>S. aureus</em> biofilm. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the iron content limitation caused by SAL can modify the <em>S. aureus</em> metabolism and/or metabolic regulators thus changing the expression of the main polysaccharides involved in biofilm formation. The exposure of biofilm to 2 mM SAL induced a 27% reduction in the intracellular free Fe2+ concentration compared with the controls. In addition, SAL depleted 23% of the available free Fe2+ cation in culture media. These moderate iron-limited conditions promoted an intensification of biofilms formed by strain Newman and by <em>S. aureus</em> clinical isolates related to the USA300 and USA100 clones. The slight decrease in iron bioavailability generated by SAL was enough to induce the increase of PIA expression in biofilms formed by methicillin-resistant as well as methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em> strains. <em>S. aureus</em> did not produce capsular polysaccharide (CP) when it was forming biofilms under any of the experimental conditions tested. Furthermore, SAL diminished aconitase activity and stimulated the lactic fermentation pathway in bacteria forming biofilms. The polysaccharide composition of <em>S. aureus</em> biofilms was examined and FTIR spectroscopic analysis revealed a clear impact of SAL in a <em>codY</em>-dependent manner. Moreover, SAL negatively affected <em>codY</em> transcription in mature biofilms thus relieving the CodY repression of the <em>ica</em> operon. Treatment of mice with SAL induced a significant increase of <em>S aureus</em> colonization. It is suggested that the elevated PIA expression induced by SAL might be responsible for the high nasal colonization observed in mice. SAL-induced biofilms may contribute to <em>S. aureus</em> infection persistence in vegetarian individuals as well as in patients that frequently consume aspirin.</li>

<li>It has long been proposed that the gut microbiome contributes to breast carcinogenesis by modifying systemic estrogen levels. This is often cited as a possible mechanism linking breast cancer and high-fat, low-fiber diets as well as antibiotic exposure, associations previously identified in population-based studies. More recently, a distinct microbiome has been identified within breast milk and tissue, but few studies have characterized differences in the breast tissue microbiota of patients with and without cancer, and none have investigated distant body-site microbiomes outside of the gut. We hypothesize that cancerous breast tissue is associated with a microbiomic profile distinct from that of benign breast tissue, and that microbiomes of more distant sites, the oral cavity and urinary tract, will reflect dysbiosis as well. Fifty-seven women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy and 21 healthy women undergoing cosmetic breast surgery were enrolled. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from urine, oral rinse and surgically collected breast tissue, sequenced, and processed through a QIIME-based bioinformatics pipeline. Cancer patient breast tissue microbiomes clustered significantly differently from non-cancer patients (<em>p</em>=0.03), largely driven by decreased relative abundance of <em>Methylobacterium</em> in cancer patients (median 0.10 vs. 0.24, <em>p</em>=0.03). There were no significant differences in oral rinse samples. Differences in urinary microbiomes were largely explained by menopausal status, with peri/postmenopausal women showing decreased levels of <em>Lactobacillus</em>. Independent of menopausal status, however, cancer patients had increased levels of gram-positive organisms including <em>Corynebacterium</em> (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01), <em>Staphylococcus</em> (<em>p</em>=0.02)<em>, Actinomyces</em> (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01), and Propionibacteriaceae (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). Our observations suggest that the local breast microbiota differ in patients with and without breast cancer. Cancer patient urinary microbiomes were characterized by increased levels of gram-positive organisms in this study, but need to be further studied in larger cohorts.</li>

<li>Individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently harbor abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiome; however, the microbiota associated with precancerous lesions in hereditary CRC remains largely unknown. We studied colonic mucosa of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who develop benign precursor lesions (polyps) early in life. We identified patchy bacterial biofilms composed predominately of <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>. Genes for colibactin (<em>clbB</em>) and <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> toxin (<em>bft</em>), encoding secreted oncotoxins, were highly enriched in FAP patients’ colonic mucosa compared to healthy individuals. Tumor-prone mice cocolonized with <em>E. coli</em> (expressing colibactin), and enterotoxigenic <em>B. fragilis</em> showed increased interleukin-17 in the colon and DNA damage in colonic epithelium with faster tumor onset and greater mortality, compared to mice with either bacterial strain alone. These data suggest an unexpected link between early neoplasia of the colon and tumorigenic bacteria.</li>

<p>Pro-carcinogenic bacteria have the potential to initiate and/or promote colon cancer, in part via immune mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Using <em>ApcMin</em> mice colonized with the human pathobiont enterotoxigenic <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> (ETBF) as a model of microbe-induced colon tumorigenesis, we show that the <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> toxin (BFT) triggers a pro-carcinogenic, multi-step inflammatory cascade requiring IL-17R, NF-κB, and Stat3 signaling in colonic epithelial cells (CECs). Although necessary, Stat3 activation in CECs is not sufficient to trigger ETBF colon tumorigenesis. Notably, IL-17-dependent NF-κB activation in CECs induces a proximal to distal mucosal gradient of C-X-C chemokines, including CXCL1, that mediates the recruitment of CXCR2-expressing polymorphonuclear immature myeloid cells with parallel onset of ETBF-mediated distal colon tumorigenesis. Thus, BFT induces a pro-carcinogenic signaling relay from the CEC to a mucosal Th17 response that results in selective NF-κB activation in distal colon CECs, which collectively triggers myeloid-cell-dependent distal colon tumorigenesis.<br />

<p>Human gut microbiota from PD patients induce enhanced motor dysfunction in mice</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. However, a functional link between gut bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases remains unexplored. Synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregation of the protein α-synuclein (αSyn), often resulting in motor dysfunction as exemplified by Parkinson’s disease (PD). Using mice that overexpress αSyn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of αSyn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.</p>

Abstract<br />
Objectives<br />
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/traumatic-brain-injury">Traumatic brain injury</a> (TBI) has complex effects on the gastrointestinal tract that are associated with TBI-related morbidity and mortality. We examined changes in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/mucous-membrane">mucosal</a> barrier properties and enteric <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/glial-cells">glial cell</a> response in the gut after experimental TBI in mice, as well as effects of the enteric pathogen <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/citrobacter-rodentium"><em>Citrobacter rodentium</em></a> (<em>Cr</em>) on both gut and brain after injury.<br />
Methods<br />
Moderate-level TBI was induced in C57BL/6 mice by controlled cortical impact (CCI). Mucosal barrier function was assessed by transepithelial resistance, fluorescent-labelled dextran flux, and quantification of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tight-junction">tight junction</a> proteins. Enteric glial cell number and activation were measured by Sox10 expression and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein">GFAP</a> reactivity, respectively. Separate groups of mice were challenged with <em>Cr</em> infection during the chronic phase of TBI, and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/host-immune-response">host immune response</a>, barrier integrity, enteric glial cell reactivity, and progression of brain injury and inflammation were assessed.<br />
Results<br />
Chronic CCI induced changes in colon morphology, including increased mucosal depth and smooth muscle thickening. At day 28 post-CCI, increased paracellular permeability and decreased claudin-1 mRNA and protein expression were observed in the absence of inflammation in the colon. Colonic glial cell GFAP and Sox10 expression were significantly increased 28 days after brain injury. Clearance of <em>Cr</em> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/downregulation-and-upregulation">upregulation</a> of Th1/Th17 <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cytokines">cytokines</a> in the colon were unaffected by CCI; however, colonic paracellular flux and enteric glial cell GFAP expression were significantly increased. Importantly, <em>Cr</em> infection in chronically-injured mice worsened the brain lesion injury and increased astrocyte- and microglial-mediated inflammation.<br />
Conclusion<br />
These experimental studies demonstrate chronic and bidirectional <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/gutbrain-axis">brain-gut</a> interactions after TBI, which may negatively impact late outcomes after brain injury.</li>

<li>It has become apparent that the intestinal microbiota orchestrates important aspects of our metabolism, immunity, and development. Recent work has demonstrated that the microbiota also influences brain function in healthy and diseased individuals. Of great interest are reports that intestinal bacteria play a role in the pathogenic cascade of both Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. These neurodegenerative disorders both involve misfolding of endogenous proteins that spreads from one region of the body to another in a manner analogous to prions. The mechanisms of how the microbiota influences or is correlated with disease require elaboration. Microbial proteins or metabolites may influence neurodegeneration through the promotion of amyloid formation by human proteins or by enhancing inflammatory responses to endogenous neuronal amyloids. We review the current knowledge concerning bacterial amyloids and their potential to influence cerebral amyloid aggregation and neuroinflammation. We propose the term “mapranosis” to describe the process of microbiota-associated proteopathy and neuroinflammation. The study of amyloid proteins made by the microbiota and their influence on health and disease is in its infancy. This is a promising area for therapeutic intervention because there are many ways to alter our microbial partners and their products, including amyloid proteins.</li>

<p>Skin microbiota can impact allergic and autoimmune responses, wound healing, and anti-microbial defense. We investigated the role of skin microbiota in cutaneous leishmaniasis and found that human patients infected with <em>Leishmania braziliensis</em> develop dysbiotic skin microbiota, characterized by increases in the abundance of <em>Staphylococcus</em> and/or <em>Streptococcus</em>. Mice infected with <em>L. major</em> exhibit similar changes depending upon disease severity. Importantly, this dysbiosis is not limited to the lesion site, but is transmissible to normal skin distant from the infection site and to skin from co-housed naive mice. This observation allowed us to test whether a pre-existing dysbiotic skin microbiota influences disease, and we found that challenging dysbiotic naive mice with <em>L. major</em> or testing for contact hypersensitivity results in exacerbated skin inflammatory responses. These findings demonstrate that a dysbiotic skin microbiota is not only a consequence of tissue stress, but also enhances inflammation, which has implications for many inflammatory cutaneous diseases.</p>

<li>Critical illness is hypothesized to associate with loss of “health- promoting” commensal microbes and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (dysbiosis). This dysbiosis is believed to increase susceptibility to nosocomial infections, sepsis, and organ failure. A trial with prospective monitoring of the intensive care unit (ICU) patient microbiome using culture-independent techniques to confirm and character- ize this dysbiosis is thus urgently needed. Characterizing ICU patient microbiome changes may provide first steps toward the development of diagnostic and thera- peutic interventions using microbiome signatures. To characterize the ICU patient microbiome, we collected fecal, oral, and skin samples from 115 mixed ICU patients across four centers in the United States and Canada. Samples were collected at two time points: within 48 h of ICU admission, and at ICU discharge or on ICU day 10. Sample collection and processing were performed according to Earth Microbiome Project protocols. We applied SourceTracker to assess the source composition of ICU patient samples by using Qiita, including samples from the American Gut Project (AGP), mammalian corpse decomposition samples, childhood (Global Gut study), and house surfaces. Our results demonstrate that critical illness leads to significant and rapid dysbiosis. Many taxons significantly depleted from ICU patients versus AGP healthy controls are key “health-promoting” organisms, and overgrowth of known pathogens was frequent. Source compositions of ICU patient samples are largely un- characteristic of the expected community type. Between time points and within a patient, the source composition changed dramatically. Our initial results show great promise for microbiome signatures as diagnostic markers and guides to therapeutic interventions in the ICU to repopulate the normal, “health-promoting” microbiome and thereby improve patient outcomes.</li>

<li>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia in the western world, however there is no cure available for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Despite clinical and experimental evidence implicating the intestinal microbiota in a number of brain disorders, its impact on Alzheimer’s disease is not known. To this end we sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA from fecal samples of Aβ precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse model and found a remarkable shift in the gut microbiota as compared to non-transgenic wild-type mice. Subsequently we generated germ-free APP transgenic mice and found a drastic reduction of cerebral Aβ amyloid pathology when compared to control mice with intestinal microbiota. Importantly, colonization of germ-free APP transgenic mice with microbiota from conventionally-raised APP transgenic mice increased cerebral Aβ pathology, while colonization with microbiota from wild-type mice was less effective in increasing cerebral Aβ levels. Our results indicate a microbial involvement in the development of Abeta amyloid pathology, and suggest that microbiota may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are a cause of stroke and seizure for which no effective medical therapies yet exist. CCMs arise from the loss of an adaptor complex that negatively regulates MEKK3–KLF2/4 signalling in brain endothelial cells, but upstream activators of this disease pathway have yet to be identified. Here we identify endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the gut microbiome as critical stimulants of CCM formation. Activation of TLR4 by Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide accelerates CCM formation, and genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TLR4 signalling prevents CCM formation in mice. Polymorphisms that increase expression of the <em>TLR4</em> gene or the gene encoding its co-receptor CD14 are associated with higher CCM lesion burden in humans. Germ-free mice are protected from CCM formation, and a single course of antibiotics permanently alters CCM susceptibility in mice. These studies identify unexpected roles for the microbiome and innate immune signalling in the pathogenesis of a cerebrovascular disease, as well as strategies for its treatment.</li>

•Paneth cell autophagy protects against acute infection<br />
•Loss of Paneth cell autophagy results in impaired intestinal permeability<br />
•Loss of Paneth cell autophagy leads to TNF- and IFN-γ mediated intestinal pathology</p>
<p>The protozoan parasite <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> triggers severe small intestinal immunopathology characterized by IFN-γ- and intestinal microbiota-mediated inflammation, Paneth cell loss, and bacterial dysbiosis. Paneth cells are a prominent secretory epithelial cell type that resides at the base of intestinal crypts and releases antimicrobial peptides. We demonstrate that the microbiota triggers basal Paneth cell-specific autophagy via induction of IFN-γ, a known trigger of autophagy, to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Deletion of the autophagy protein Atg5 specifically in Paneth cells results in exaggerated intestinal inflammation characterized by complete destruction of the intestinal crypts resembling that seen in pan-epithelial Atg5-deficient mice. Additionally, lack of functional autophagy in Paneth cells within intestinal organoids and <em>T. gondii</em>-infected mice causes increased sensitivity to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF along with increased intestinal permeability, leading to exaggerated microbiota- and IFN-γ-dependent intestinal immunopathology. Thus, Atg5 expression in Paneth cells is essential for tissue protection against cytokine-mediated immunopathology during acute gastrointestinal infection.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clostridium difficile is the most commonly reported nosocomial pathogen in the United States and is an urgent public health concern worldwide1. Over the past decade, incidence, severity and costs associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) have increased dramatically2. CDI is most commonly initiated by antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota; however, non-antibiotic-associated CDI cases are well documented and on the rise3, 4. This suggests that unexplored environmental, nutrient and host factors probably influence CDI. Here we show that excess dietary zinc (Zn) substantially alters the gut microbiota and, in turn, reduces the minimum amount of antibiotics needed to confer susceptibility to CDI. In mice colonized with C. difficile, excess dietary Zn severely exacerbated C. difficile–associated disease by increasing toxin activity and altering the host immune response. In addition, we show that the Zn-binding S100 protein calprotectin has antimicrobial effects against C. difficile and is an essential component of the innate immune response to CDI. Taken together, these data suggest that nutrient Zn levels have a key role in determining susceptibility to CDI and severity of disease, and that calprotectin-mediated metal limitation is an important factor in the host immune response to C. difficile.</li>

<li>Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) may be present in food packaging, which would put consumers at risk of NP ingestion. There is little information on the amount of ZnO NP that are present in food packaging and the effects of ZnO exposure on intestinal function. To estimate physiologically relevant ZnO exposures, foods that are naturally low in zinc (Zn), but are commonly packaged with ZnO NP, such as tuna, corn, and asparagus, were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was found that the Zn present in a serving of these foods is approximately one hundred times higher than the recommended dietary allowance. An <em>in vitro</em> model of the small intestine composed of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells was used to investigate the effects of ZnO NP exposure. Cells were exposed to physiologically realistic doses of pristine NP in culture medium and to NP subjected to an <em>in vitro</em> digestion to better reflect the transformation that the NP may undergo once they enter the human GI tract. Uptake and/or transport of iron (Fe), Zn, glucose, and fatty acids were assessed and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) levels were measured before and after NP exposure. The findings show that there is a 75% decrease in Fe transport and a 30% decrease in glucose transport following ZnO NP exposure. These decreases were consistent with gene expression changes for their transporters. There is also evidence that the ZnO NP affect the microvilli of the intestinal cells, therefore reducing the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients. These results suggest that the ingestion of physiologically relevant doses of ZnO NP can alter intestinal function in an <em>in vitro</em> model of the human small intestine.</li>

<li>The importance of the gut microbiome for bone metabolism in mice has recently been demonstrated, but no studies are available in humans. <em>Lactobacillus reuteri</em> ATCCPTA 6475 (<em>L. reuteri</em> 6475) has been reported to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in mice but its effect on the human skeleton is unknown. The objective of this trial was to investigate if <em>L. reuteri</em> 6475 affects bone loss in older women with low BMD. In this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, women from the population who were 75 to 80 years old and had low BMD were randomized to orally receive 1010 colony‐forming units of <em>L. reuteri</em> 6475 daily or placebo. The predefined primary end‐point was relative change after 12 months in tibia total volumetric BMD (vBMD).<br />
Ninety women were included and 70 completed the study. <em>L. reuteri</em> 6475 reduced loss of total vBMD compared to placebo both in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis (‐0.83% [95% confidence interval [CI], ‐1.47 to ‐0.19%] vs. ‐1.85% [95% CI, ‐2.64 to ‐1.07%]; mean difference 1.02% [95% CI, 0.02 to 2.03]) and per protocol analysis (‐0.93% [95% CI, ‐1.45 to ‐0.40] vs. ‐1.86% [95% CI, ‐2.35 to ‐1.36]; mean difference 0.93% [95% CI, 0.21 to 1.65]. In general, similar but smaller effects were observed in the secondary bone variable outcomes, but these differences did not reach statistical significance in the ITT population. Adverse events did not differ between groups. In conclusion, supplementation with <em>L. reuteri</em> 6475 should be further explored as a novel approach to prevent age‐associated bone loss and osteoporosis.</li>

<li>Obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), the greatest cause of disability in the US. The impact of obesity on OA is driven by systemic inflammation, and increased systemic inflammation is now understood to be caused by gut microbiome dysbiosis. Oligofructose, a nondigestible prebiotic fiber, can restore a lean gut microbial community profile in the context of obesity, suggesting a potentially novel approach to treat the OA of obesity. Here, we report that — compared with the lean murine gut — obesity is associated with loss of beneficial <em>Bifidobacteria</em>, while key proinflammatory species gain in abundance. A downstream systemic inflammatory signature culminates with macrophage migration to the synovium and accelerated knee OA. Oligofructose supplementation restores the lean gut microbiome in obese mice, in part, by supporting key commensal microflora, particularly <em>Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</em>. This is associated with reduced inflammation in the colon, circulation, and knee and protection from OA. This observation of a gut microbiome–OA connection sets the stage for discovery of potentially new OA therapeutics involving strategic manipulation of specific microbial species inhabiting the intestinal space.</li>

<li>Psychobiotics were previously defined as live bacteria (probiotics) which, when ingested, confer mental health benefits through interactions with commensal gut bacteria. We expand this definition to encompass prebiotics, which enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. We review probiotic and prebiotic effects on emotional, cognitive, systemic, and neural variables relevant to health and disease. We discuss gut–brain signalling mechanisms enabling psychobiotic effects, such as metabolite production. Overall, knowledge of how the microbiome responds to exogenous influence remains limited. We tabulate several important research questions and issues, exploration of which will generate both mechanistic insights and facilitate future psychobiotic development. We suggest the definition of psychobiotics be expanded beyond probiotics and prebiotics to include other means of influencing the microbiome.</li>

<li>The dense microbial ecosystem in the gut is intimately connected to numerous facets of human biology, and manipulation of the gut microbiota has broad implications for human health. In the absence of profound perturbation, the bacterial strains that reside within an individual are mostly stable over time<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0092-4#ref-CR1">59</a>. By contrast, the fate of exogenous commensal and probiotic strains applied to an established microbiota is variable, generally unpredictable and greatly influenced by the background microbiota<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0092-4#ref-CR2">60</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0092-4#ref-CR3">61</a>. Therefore, analysis of the factors that govern strain engraftment and abundance is of critical importance to the emerging field of microbiome reprogramming. Here we generate an exclusive metabolic niche in mice via administration of a marine polysaccharide, porphyran, and an exogenous <em>Bacteroides</em> strain harbouring a rare gene cluster for porphyran utilization. Privileged nutrient access enables reliable engraftment of the exogenous strain at predictable abundances in mice harbouring diverse communities of gut microbes. This targeted dietary support is sufficient to overcome priority exclusion by an isogenic strain<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0092-4#ref-CR4">62</a>, and enables strain replacement. We demonstrate transfer of the 60-kb porphyran utilization locus into a naive strain of <em>Bacteroides</em>, and show finely tuned control of strain abundance in the mouse gut across multiple orders of magnitude by varying porphyran dosage. Finally, we show that this system enables the introduction of a new strain into the colonic crypt ecosystem. These data highlight the influence of nutrient availability in shaping microbiota membership, expand the ability to perform a broad spectrum of investigations in the context of a complex microbiota, and have implications for cell-based therapeutic strategies in the gut.</li>

<p>Pathogen virulence exists on a continuum. The strategies that drive symptomatic or asymptomatic infections remain largely unknown. We took advantage of the concept of lethal dose 50 (LD50) to ask which component of individual non-genetic variation between hosts defines whether they survive or succumb to infection. Using the enteric pathogen Citrobacter, we found no difference in pathogen burdens between healthy and symptomatic populations. Iron metabolism-related genes were induced in asymptomatic hosts compared to symptomatic or naive mice. Dietary iron conferred complete protection without influencing pathogen burdens, even at 1000× the lethal dose of Citrobacter. Dietary iron induced insulin resistance, increasing glucose levels in the intestine that were necessary and sufficient to suppress pathogen virulence. A short course of dietary iron drove the selection of attenuated Citrobacter strains that can transmit and asymptomatically colonize naive hosts, demonstrating that environmental factors and cooperative metabolic strategies can drive conversion of pathogens toward commensalism.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Background<br />
Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). It restores the disrupted intestinal microbiota and subsequently suppresses C. difficile. The long-term stability of the intestinal microbiota and the recovery of mucosal microbiota, both of which have not been previously studied, are assessed herein. Further, the specific bacteria behind the treatment efficacy are also investigated.</p>
<p>Methods<br />
We performed a high-throughput microbiota profiling using a phylogenetic microarray analysis of 131 faecal and mucosal samples from 14 rCDI patients pre- and post-FMT during a 1-year follow-up and 23 samples from the three universal donors over the same period.</p>
<p>Results<br />
The FMT treatment was successful in all patients. FMT reverted the patients’ bacterial community to become dominated by Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, the major anaerobic bacterial groups of the healthy gut. In the mucosa, the amount of facultative anaerobes decreased, whereas Bacteroidetes increased. Post-FMT, the patients’ microbiota profiles were more similar to their own donors than what is generally observed for unrelated subjects and this striking similarity was retained throughout the 1-year follow-up. Furthermore, the universal donor approach allowed us to identify bacteria commonly established in all CDI patients and revealed a commonly acquired core microbiota consisting of 24 bacterial taxa.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />
FMT induces profound microbiota changes, therefore explaining the high clinical efficacy for rCDI. The identification of commonly acquired bacteria could lead to effective bacteriotherapeutic formulations. FMT can affect microbiota in the long-term and offers a means to modify it relatively permanently for the treatment of microbiota-associated diseases.</p>

<li>Question  Does the clinical efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating recurrent <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (RCDI) depend on the route of delivery?<br />
Findings  In this noninferiority randomized clinical trial that included 116 adults with RCDI, the proportion without recurrence over 12 weeks was 96.2% after a single treatment in a group treated with oral capsules and in a group treated via colonoscopy, meeting the noninferiority margin of 15%.<br />
Meaning  FMT by oral capsules may be an effective approach to treating RCDI.<br />
Abstract<br />
Importance  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in preventing recurrent <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (RCDI). However, it is not known whether clinical efficacy differs by route of delivery.<br />
Objective  To determine whether FMT by oral capsule is noninferior to colonoscopy delivery in efficacy.<br />
Design, Setting, and Participants  Noninferiority, unblinded, randomized trial conducted in 3 academic centers in Alberta, Canada. A total of 116 adult patients with RCDI were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2016, with follow-up to December 2016. The noninferiority margin was 15%.<br />
Interventions  Participants were randomly assigned to FMT by capsule or by colonoscopy at a 1:1 ratio.<br />
Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the proportion of patients without RCDI 12 weeks after FMT. Secondary outcomes included (1) serious and minor adverse events, (2) changes in quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form Survey on a scale of 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life), and (3) patient perception on a scale of 1 (not at all unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant) and satisfaction on a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst).<br />
Results  Among 116 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 58 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.10.25">19</a> years; 79 women [68%]), 105 (91%) completed the trial, with 57 patients randomized to the capsule group and 59 to the colonoscopy group. In per-protocol analysis, prevention of RCDI after a single treatment was achieved in 96.2% in both the capsule group (51/53) and the colonoscopy group (50/52) (difference, 0%; 1-sided 95% CI, −6.1% to infinity; <em>P</em> &lt; .001), meeting the criterion for noninferiority. One patient in each group died of underlying cardiopulmonary illness unrelated to FMT. Rates of minor adverse events were 5.4% for the capsule group vs 12.5% for the colonoscopy group. There was no significant between-group difference in improvement in quality of life. A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving capsules rated their experience as “not at all unpleasant” (66% vs 44%; difference, 22% [95% CI, 3%-40%]; <em>P</em> = .01).<br />
Conclusions and Relevance  Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not inferior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent infection over 12 weeks. Treatment with oral capsules may be an effective approach to treating RCDI.</li>

•FCM is useful for process control of SSFs.</p>
<p>While slow sand filters (SSFs) have produced drinking water for more than a hundred years, understanding of their associated microbial communities is limited. In this study, bacteria in influent and effluent water from full-scale SSFs were explored using flow cytometry (FCM) with cytometric histogram image comparison (CHIC) analysis; and routine microbial counts for heterotrophs, total coliforms and Escherichia coli. To assess if FCM can monitor biofilm function, SSFs differing in age and sand composition were compared. FCM profiles from two established filters were indistinguishable. To examine biofilm in the deep sand bed, SSFs were monitored during a scraping event, when the top layer of sand and the schmutzdecke are removed to restore flow through the filter. The performance of an established SSF was stable: total organic carbon (TOC), pH, numbers of heterotrophs, coliforms, E. coli, and FCM bacterial profile were unaffected by scraping. However, the performance of two newly-built SSFs containing new and mixed sand was compromised: breakthrough of both microbial indicators and TOC occurred following scraping. The compromised performance of the new SSFs was reflected in distinct effluent bacterial communities; and, the presence of microbial indicators correlated to influent bacterial communities. This demonstrated that FCM can monitor SSF performance. Removal of the top layer of sand did not alter the effluent water from the established SSF, but did affect that of the SSFs containing new sand. This suggests that the impact of the surface biofilm on effluent water is greater when the deep sand bed biofilm is not established.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reproduction and growth of viruses depend on successful encounters with appropriate hosts. However, some hosts are difficult to encounter. In particular, chloroviruses cannot reach their target zoochlorellae hosts, because zoochlorellae are endosymbionts, living inside the cell of a protist that protects the zoochlorellae from the chlorovirus. The protist host is subject to predation, and we show that copepods foraging on zoochlorellae-bearing protists can disrupt the mutualism and pass endosymbiontic zoochlorellae through their guts, exposing them to chloroviruses. In this way, predators can catalyze the virus population growth by breaking down physical barriers between viruses and their endosymbiont hosts.</p>
<p>Virus population growth depends on contacts between viruses and their hosts. It is often unclear how sufficient contacts are made between viruses and their specific hosts to generate spikes in viral abundance. Here, we show that copepods, acting as predators, can bring aquatic viruses and their algal hosts into contact. Specifically, predation of the protist <em>Paramecium bursaria</em> by copepods resulted in a &gt;100-fold increase in the number of chloroviruses in 1 d. Copepod predation can be seen as an ecological “catalyst” by increasing contacts between chloroviruses and their hosts, zoochlorellae (endosymbiotic algae that live within paramecia), thereby facilitating viral population growth. When feeding, copepods passed <em>P. bursaria</em> through their digestive tract only partially digested, releasing endosymbiotic algae that still supported viral reproduction and resulting in a virus population spike. A simple predator–prey model parameterized for copepods consuming protists generates cycle periods for viruses consistent with those observed in natural ponds. Food webs are replete with similar symbiotic organisms, and we suspect the predator catalyst mechanism is capable of generating blooms for other endosymbiont-targeting viruses.</p>

<li>Aerosolization of soil-dust and organic aggregates in sea spray facilitates the long-range transport of bacteria, and likely viruses across the free atmosphere. Although long-distance transport occurs, there are many uncertainties associated with their deposition rates. Here, we demonstrate that even in pristine environments, above the atmospheric boundary layer, the downward flux of viruses ranged from 0.26 × 109 to &gt;7 × 109 m−2 per day. These deposition rates were 9–461 times greater than the rates for bacteria, which ranged from 0.3 × 107 to &gt;8 × 107 m−2 per day. The highest relative deposition rates for viruses were associated with atmospheric transport from marine rather than terrestrial sources. Deposition rates of bacteria were significantly higher during rain events and Saharan dust intrusions, whereas, rainfall did not significantly influence virus deposition. Virus deposition rates were positively correlated with organic aerosols &lt;0.7 μm, whereas, bacteria were primarily associated with organic aerosols &gt;0.7 μm, implying that viruses could have longer residence times in the atmosphere and, consequently, will be dispersed further. These results provide an explanation for enigmatic observations that viruses with very high genetic identity can be found in very distant and different environments.</li>

Vesicles containing virus clusters remain intact during fecal-oral transmission<br />
Vesicles achieve a high MOI and induce severe disease<br />
Vesicle-cloaked viral clusters are more virulent units than free viral particles</p>
<p>In enteric viral infections, such as those with rotavirus and norovirus, individual viral particles shed in stool are considered the optimal units of fecal-oral transmission. We reveal that rotaviruses and noroviruses are also shed in stool as viral clusters enclosed within vesicles that deliver a high inoculum to the receiving host. Cultured cells non-lytically release rotaviruses and noroviruses inside extracellular vesicles. In addition, stools of infected hosts contain norovirus and rotavirus within vesicles of exosomal or plasma membrane origin. These vesicles remain intact during fecal-oral transmission and thereby transport multiple viral particles collectively to the next host, enhancing both the MOI and disease severity. Vesicle-cloaked viruses are non-negligible populations in stool and have a disproportionately larger contribution to infectivity than free viruses. Our findings indicate that vesicle-cloaked viruses are highly virulent units of fecal-oral transmission and highlight a need for antivirals targeting vesicles and virus clustering.</p>

<p>•Biofilm cells exhibit heterogeneity (firing/non-firing) in electrical signaling<br />
•Firing cells arrange themselves into a theoretically predicted percolated network<br />
•Percolation model accounts for signal transmission in wild-type and mutant biofilms<br />
•Cost-benefit balance can organize the community at the critical percolation point</p>
<p>Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.</p>
