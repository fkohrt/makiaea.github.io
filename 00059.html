<h2>clear purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>clear purpose makes it easy to choose, creates momentum. purpose comes from knowing a destination. helps us to aim towards it rather than away.</li>
</ul>
<h2>salience not importance</h2>
<ul>
<li>we can understand better what real issues are by recognising those which are misleadingly salient</li>
<li>what is most salient is often not what is most important</li>
<li>people don't neglect the environment because they are evil, although some do, but like many human responsibilities, because something else more salient has their attention. that isn't to say that what has caught our attention is more important, simply that we have given it our attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>thinking about how we think</h2>
<ul>
<li>my empathy and predictive sense as a internalised informal chance forecast</li>
<li>for example, speed. you might remember from physics the definition that something’s speed is the frequency with which it occurs. but what happens when we change a speed? are we increasing the frequency, and is it by changing the likelihood? what does speed mean when we say a catalyst speeds up a reaction? the chemist’s reaction rate is a description of speed.
<ul>
<li>what if we can replace speed with the concept of likelihood? so that something is faster as its likelihood increases? so a catalyst does not increase the speed of a reaction but rather makes it more likely, and the passing of time does the rest.</li>
<li>so too words and concepts, ideas and beliefs are catalysts that make certain actions more or less likely, depending on how you define the action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we are amoral — without morals — when we do not know, have not learned the concept of, or have not gained or have lost the ability to think about how something we do affects others. for young children, this may mean that they have not been taught the concept of caring for others, or that this concept is not salient to them, or that they have been taught to prioritise other things — whether by the intention of their guardians, neglect, or circumstance. it may well be that their frontal brain lobes are not developed enough to learn this yet — but it may be that learning and practicing this social skill is one of the major ways in which our brains develop in complexity and ability as we grow.
<ul>
<li>they are all amoral, because their only way to understand morality is their own internal feelings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we don't often ask why or how we do things, or when we don't do certain things. these are very interesting questions, the answers to which may be fun to write and read about.</li>
</ul>
<h2>value</h2>
<ul>
<li>when someone’s achievements are not encoded in money or scientific papers or prestige, most people will have a hard time understanding the worth of that person</li>
<li>might think of book as free and thus not value it. but we have paid dearly as individuals, as a culture, as a planet, to reach this point.</li>
<li>blame is based on judgment, which is based on worth, which is based on value. we need to unlearn all that we have learned.</li>
<li>to see if something we want is worth buying, express in equivalent hours or days or years of life required to earn money to purchase item</li>
<li>what would be an equivalent expression for virtue or responsible action?</li>

<p>&quot;The Getzels-Jackson effect is not restricted to schools, and it persists into adulthood. Decision makers and authority figures in business, science, and government all say they value creation, but when tested, they do not value creators.<br />
Why? Because people who are more creative also tend to be more playful, unconventional, and unpredictable, and all of this makes them harder to control. No matter how much we say we value creation, deep down, most of us value control more. And so we fear change and favor familiarity. Rejecting is a reflex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that Galambos eventually turned out to be right is beside the point. Organizations are not supposed to work this way. Brilliant, innovative thinking is meant to be encouraged. Galambos and his idea should and could have made a beachhead on a whole new continent of fertile research opportunities. Instead, important discoveries about glia and the brain were delayed for decades. We are learning things today that we could have found out in the 1970s. So why would a distinguished scientist like David Rioch be provoked to anger by an idea proposed by an equally distinguished scientist like Robert Galambos?<br />
The problem was not Rioch. Robert Galambos’s story is typical—it happens in almost every organization almost all the time. Kelly Johnson’s is not. Both men are examples of what management scholars Larry Downes and Paul Nunes call “truth-tellers”:<br />
Truth-tellers are genuinely passionate about solving big problems. They harangue you with their vision, and as a result they rarely stay in one company for very long. They are not model employees—their true loyalty is to the future, not next quarter’s profits. They can tell you what’s coming, but not necessarily when or how. Truth-tellers are often eccentric and difficult to manage. They speak a strange language, one that isn’t focused on incremental change and polite business-speak. Learning to find them is hard. Learning to understand them, and appreciate their value, is even harder.<br />
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truth-tellers are a bit like the glia of organizations: long overlooked, yet essential for regeneration. They may not be popular. The truth is often awkward and unwelcome, and so are the people who tell it.<br />
As we have seen in our discussions of rejection, confrontations about ideas are hardwired into human nature. The hallmark of a creative organization is that it is much more receptive to new thinking than the world in general. A creative organization does not resent conflicts over concepts; it resolves them. But most organizations are not like Lockheed—they are like Walter Reed. So most truth-tellers are not treated like Kelly Johnson—they are treated like Robert Galambos. We do not walk in a welcoming world when we are given the gift of great thoughts. Great thoughts are great threats.<br />

<p>expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot control the future. Being too rigid about making things happen the way you planned stops you from reacting to emerging problems and causes you to miss unexpected opportunities. Have high expectations about what and few expectations about how. This is the opposite of the way most organizations operate.</li>

<h1>reaction time by itself is a useless measure. what use fast reaction time if you don't perceive what you need to react to? or react inappropriately?</h1>
