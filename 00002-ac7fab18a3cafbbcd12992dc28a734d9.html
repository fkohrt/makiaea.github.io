<p><em>cell type-specific suppression of mechanosensitive genes by audible sound stimulation</em><br />
masahiro kumeta et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188764">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188764</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Audible sound is a ubiquitous environmental factor in nature that transmits oscillatory compressional pressure through the substances. To investigate the property of the sound as a mechanical stimulus for cells, an experimental system was set up using 94.0 dB sound which transmits approximately 10 mPa pressure to the cultured cells. Based on research on mechanotransduction and ultrasound effects on cells, gene responses to the audible sound stimulation were analyzed by varying several sound parameters: frequency, wave form, composition, and exposure time. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed a distinct suppressive effect for several mechanosensitive and ultrasound-sensitive genes that were triggered by sounds. The effect was clearly observed in a wave form- and pressure level-specific manner, rather than the frequency, and persisted for several hours. At least two mechanisms are likely to be involved in this sound response: transcriptional control and RNA degradation. ST2 stromal cells and C2C12 myoblasts exhibited a robust response, whereas NIH3T3 cells were partially and NB2a neuroblastoma cells were completely insensitive, suggesting a cell type-specific response to sound. These findings reveal a cell-level systematic response to audible sound and uncover novel relationships between life and sound.</li>

<p><em>feature-selective encoding of substrate vibrations in the forelimb somatosensory cortex</em><br />
mario prsa et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1015-8">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1015-8</a></p>

<p>Using two-photon microscopy, Daniel Huber's team visualized the activity of hundreds of neurons in a mouse's somatosensory cortex as vibrations of different frequencies were delivered to its forepaw. Like in the auditory cortex, individual neurons were selectively tuned: they strongly responded to some frequencies and less so to others. &quot;It turns out that these neurons are preferentially tuned to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude, and that this combination corresponds to what the mouse actually perceives. In other words, a mouse is unable to distinguish a high-frequency vibration with a low amplitude from a low-frequency vibration with a higher amplitude,&quot; explains Mario Prsa, a researcher in Dr. Huber's team and the study's first author. &quot;It is the same psychoacoustic effect detected in the auditory system, where the perceived pitch of a sound changes with both frequency and loudness.&quot; Thus, despite the fact that sounds -- which travel through the air -- and vibrations -- which are transmitted through solid matter -- are processed by different sensory channels, they are both perceived and encoded similarly in the brain.</p>
<p>Everything goes through Pacinian corpuscles</p>
<p>In a second step, the researchers sought to identify the origin of the somatosensory stimuli involved by performing a detailed histological analysis of Pacinian corpuscles in mouse forelimb. Pacinian corpuscles are known to transduce high frequency vibrations in mammals and are densely expressed in the dermis of primate fingertips. &quot;Surprisingly, we found that the vibration responses in the mouse brain stem from Pacinian corpuscles located on the forearm bones, whereas they were totally absent in the paw's skin,&quot; explains Géraldine Cuenu, a student in the UNIGE master's programme in neurosciences, who took charge of this detailed analysis. Using optogenetics, the scientists confirmed the link between cortical responses and the particular configuration of mechanoreceptors in the forelimbs.</p>
<p>An ancestor of the hearing system?</p>
<p>Could it be that the particular distribution of vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptors along the bones of the forelimb acts as a seismograph to &quot;listen&quot; to vibrations? Vibratory stimuli are indeed used by a number of living organisms to communicate through plants, branches and other solid substrates. &quot;Our discoveries probably reveal the existence of an ancient sensory channel, which could be an evolutionary precursor of hearing,&quot; concludes Mario Prsa. This somewhat vestigial, yet highly sensitive modality might also explain how we are able to identify subtle clues linked to upcoming natural disasters, or why construction or traffic causes nuisances even when inaudible.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The spectral content of skin vibrations, produced by either displacing the finger across a surface texture<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR1">1</a> or passively sensing external movements through the solid substrate<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR2">2</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR3">3</a>, provides fundamental information about our environment. Low-frequency flutter (below 50 Hz) applied locally to the primate fingertip evokes cyclically entrained spiking in neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and thus spike rates in these neurons increase linearly with frequency<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR4">4</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR5">5</a>. However, the same local vibrations at high frequencies (over 100 Hz) cannot be discriminated on the basis of differences in discharge rates of S1 neurons<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR4">4</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR6">6</a>, because spiking is only partially entrained at these frequencies<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR6">6</a>. Here we investigated whether high-frequency substrate vibrations applied broadly to the mouse forelimb rely on a different cortical coding scheme. We found that forelimb S1 neurons encode vibration frequency similarly to sound pitch representation in the auditory cortex<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR7">7</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1015-8#ref-CR8">8</a>: their spike rates are selectively tuned to a preferred value of a low-level stimulus feature without any temporal entrainment. This feature, identified as the product of frequency and a power function of amplitude, was also found to be perceptually relevant as it predicted behaviour in a frequency discrimination task. Using histology, peripheral deafferentation and optogenetic receptor tagging, we show that these selective responses are inherited from deep Pacinian corpuscles located adjacent to bones, most densely around the ulna and radius and only sparsely along phalanges. This mechanoreceptor arrangement and the tuned cortical rate code suggest that the mouse forelimb constitutes a sensory channel best adapted for passive ‘listening’ to substrate vibrations, rather than for active texture exploration.</p>

<p><em>a longitudinal study of the process of acquiring absolute pitch: a practical report of training with the ‘chord identification method’</em><br />
ayako sakakibara 2014<br />

<ul>
<li>The purpose of this study was to investigate longitudinally the process of acquiring absolute pitch (AP). Twenty-four young children (aged 2 to 6 years) without AP were trained to acquire AP using Eguchi’s (1991) Chord Identification Method (CIM). All children were able to acquire AP (except two who ceased training). Results suggest that, at a minimum, children younger than 6 years old are capable of acquiring AP through intentional training. Furthermore, children’s errors observed during training suggested the transition of different strategies relying respectively on tone height and tone chroma. Initially, children identified chords using a strategy depending primarily on tone height, then gradually they began to attend to tone chroma to identify chords and this process ultimately led to acquisition of AP.</li>

<p><em>ultra-open acoustic metamaterial silencer based on fano-like interference</em><br />
reza ghaffarivardavagh et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.99.024302">http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.99.024302</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang let mathematics -- a shared passion that has buoyed both of their engineering careers and made them well-suited research partners -- guide them toward a workable design for what the acoustic metamaterial would look like.</p>
<p>They calculated the dimensions and specifications that the metamaterial would need to have in order to interfere with the transmitted sound waves, preventing sound -- but not air -- from being radiated through the open structure. The basic premise is that the metamaterial needs to be shaped in such a way that it sends incoming sounds back to where they came from, they say.</p>
<p>As a test case, they decided to create a structure that could silence sound from a loudspeaker. Based on their calculations, they modeled the physical dimensions that would most effectively silence noises. Bringing those models to life, they used 3D printing to materialize an open, noise-canceling structure made of plastic.</p>
<p>Trying it out in the lab, the researchers sealed the loudspeaker into one end of a PVC pipe. On the other end, the tailor-made acoustic metamaterial was fastened into the opening. With the hit of the play button, the experimental loudspeaker set-up came oh-so-quietly to life in the lab. Standing in the room, based on your sense of hearing alone, you'd never know that the loudspeaker was blasting an irritatingly high-pitched note. If, however, you peered into the PVC pipe, you would see the loudspeaker's subwoofers thrumming away.</p>
<p>The metamaterial, ringing around the internal perimeter of the pipe's mouth, worked like a mute button incarnate until the moment when Ghaffarivardavagh reached down and pulled it free. The lab suddenly echoed with the screeching of the loudspeaker's tune.</p>
<p>&quot;The moment we first placed and removed the silencer...was literally night and day,&quot; says Jacob Nikolajczyk, who in addition to being a study co author and former undergraduate researcher in Zhang's lab is a passionate vocal performer. &quot;We had been seeing these sorts of results in our computer modeling for months -- but it is one thing to see modeled sound pressure levels on a computer, and another to hear its impact yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>By comparing sound levels with and without the metamaterial fastened in place, the team found that they could silence nearly all -- 94 percent to be exact -- of the noise, making the sounds emanating from the loudspeaker imperceptible to the human ear.</p>
<p>Now that their prototype has proved so effective, the researchers have some big ideas about how their acoustic-silencing metamaterial could go to work making the real world quieter.</p>
<p>&quot;Drones are a very hot topic,&quot; Zhang says. Companies like Amazon are interested in using drones to deliver goods, she says, and &quot;people are complaining about the potential noise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The culprit is the upward-moving fan motion,&quot; Ghaffarivardavagh says. &quot;If we can put sound-silencing open structures beneath the drone fans, we can cancel out the sound radiating toward the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Closer to home -- or the office -- fans and HVAC systems could benefit from acoustic metamaterials that render them silent yet still enable hot or cold air to be circulated unencumbered throughout a building.</p>
<p>Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang also point to the unsightliness of the sound barriers used today to reduce noise pollution from traffic and see room for an aesthetic upgrade. &quot;Our structure is super lightweight, open, and beautiful. Each piece could be used as a tile or brick to scale up and build a sound-canceling, permeable wall,&quot; they say.</p>
<p>The shape of acoustic-silencing metamaterials, based on their method, is also completely customizable, Ghaffarivardavagh says. The outer part doesn't need to be a round ring shape in order to function.</p>
<p>&quot;We can design the outer shape as a cube or hexagon, anything really,&quot; he says. &quot;When we want to create a wall, we will go to a hexagonal shape&quot; that can fit together like an open-air honeycomb structure.</p>
<p>Such walls could help contain many types of noises. Even those from the intense vibrations of an MRI machine, Zhang says.</p>
<p>According to Stephan Anderson, a professor of radiology at BU School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study, the acoustic metamaterial could potentially be scaled &quot;to fit inside the central bore of an MRI machine,&quot; shielding patients from the sound during the imaging process.</p>
<p>Zhang says the possibilities are endless, since the noise mitigation method can be customized to suit nearly any environment: &quot;The idea is that we can now mathematically design an object that can block the sounds of anything,&quot; she says</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Recently, with advances in acoustic metamaterial science, the possibility of sound attenuation using subwavelength structures, while maintaining permeability to air, has been demonstrated. However, the ongoing challenge addressed herein is the fact that among such air-permeable structures to date, the open area represents only small fraction of the overall area of the material. In the presented paper in order to address this challenge, we first demonstrate that a transversely placed bilayer medium with large degrees of contrast in the layers' acoustic properties exhibits an asymmetric transmission, similar to the Fano-like interference phenomenon. Next, we utilize this design methodology and propose a deep-subwavelength acoustic metasurface unit cell comprising nearly 60% open area for air passage, while serving as a high-performance selective sound silencer. Finally, the proposed unit-cell performance is validated experimentally, demonstrating a reduction in the transmitted acoustic energy of up to 94%. This ultra-open metamaterial design, leveraging a Fano-like interference, enables high-performance sound silencing in a design featuring a large degree of open area, which may find utility in applications in which highly efficient, air-permeable sound silencers are required, such as smart sound barriers, fan or engine noise reduction, among others.</p>

<p><em>musical instruments as sensors</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The frequencies of notes made by a musical instrument are determined by the physical properties of the instrument. Consequently, by measuring the frequency of a note, one can infer information about the instrument’s physical properties. In this work, we show that by modifying a musical instrument to contain a sample and analyzing the instrument’s pitch, we can make precision measurements of the physical properties of the sample. We used the mbira, a 3000-year-old African musical instrument that consists of metal tines attached to a wooden board; these tines are plucked to play musical notes. By replacing the mbira’s tines with bent steel tubing, filling the tubing with a sample, using a smartphone to record the sound while plucking the tubing, and measuring the frequency of the sound using a free software tool on our website, we can measure the density of the sample with a resolution of about 0.012 g/mL. Unlike existing tools for measuring density, the mbira sensor can be made and used by virtually anyone in the world. To demonstrate the mbira sensor’s capabilities, we used it to successfully distinguish diethylene glycol and glycerol, two similar chemicals that are sometimes mistaken for each other in pharmaceutical manufacturing (leading to hundreds of deaths). We also show that consumers could use mbira sensors to detect counterfeit and adulterated medications (which represent around 10% of all medications in low- and middle-income countries). We expect that many other musical instruments can function as sensors and find important and lifesaving applications.</li>

<p><em>the sound produced by a dripping tap is driven by resonant oscillations of an entrapped air bubble</em><br />
samuel phillips et al. 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>A similar result was achieved using the second method, with washing-up liquid used as the surfactant. A video of the resulting drop impact is available as Supplementary Video S4. Bubble entrainment was prevented and no sound was produced, again confirming that the bubble-entrainment mechanism underpins the characteristic ‘plink’ sound that is of interest. Interestingly, this second result also suggests that small changes in surface tension have an effect on bubble entrainment and so this addition of a small amount of washing up liquid to the body of water may represent a simple and novel way to alleviate the annoying noise of a leaking tap or water dripping from a roof into a bucket.</li>

<p><em>photosynthesis by marine algae produces sound, contributing to the daytime soundscape on coral reefs</em><br />

<ul>
<li>We have observed that marine macroalgae produce sound during photosynthesis. The resultant soundscapes correlate with benthic macroalgal cover across shallow Hawaiian coral reefs during the day, despite the presence of other biological noise. Likely ubiquitous but previously overlooked, this source of ambient biological noise in the coastal ocean is driven by local supersaturation of oxygen near the surface of macroalgal filaments, and the resultant formation and release of oxygen-containing bubbles into the water column. During release, relaxation of the bubble to a spherical shape creates a monopole sound source that ‘rings’ at the Minnaert frequency. Many such bubbles create a large, distributed sound source over the sea floor. Reef soundscapes contain vast quantities of biological information, making passive acoustic ecosystem evaluation a tantalizing prospect if the sources are known. Our observations introduce the possibility of a general, volumetrically integrative, noninvasive, rapid and remote technique for evaluating algal abundance and rates of primary productivity in littoral aquatic communities. Increased algal cover is one of the strongest indicators for coral reef ecosystem stress. Visually determining variations in algal abundance is a time-consuming and expensive process. This technique could therefore provide a valuable tool for ecosystem management but also for industrial monitoring of primary production, such as in algae-based biofuel synthesis.</li>

<p><em>near-surface environmentally forced changes in the ross ice shelf observed with ambient seismic noise</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Continuous seismic observations across the Ross Ice Shelf reveal ubiquitous ambient resonances at frequencies &gt;5 Hz. These firn‐trapped surface wave signals arise through wind and snow bedform interactions coupled with very low velocity structures. Progressive and long‐term spectral changes are associated with surface snow redistribution by wind and with a January 2016 regional melt event. Modeling demonstrates high spectral sensitivity to near‐surface (top several meters) elastic parameters. We propose that spectral peak changes arise from surface snow redistribution in wind events and to velocity drops reflecting snow lattice weakening near 0°C for the melt event. Percolation‐related refrozen layers and layer thinning may also contribute to long‐term spectral changes after the melt event. Single‐station observations are inverted for elastic structure for multiple stations across the ice shelf. High‐frequency ambient noise seismology presents opportunities for continuous assessment of near‐surface ice shelf or other firn environments.</li>

<p>for me, practicing and playing piano is like meditation or yoga or running — serenely in the moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how I learn piano pieces<br />
i trust that i will learn the piece, even if it seems daunting at first; i know that with spaced recall and starting from the end, i will eventually learn to play it from recall and by touch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning a piano piece by spaced recall of music notation (traditional notation or synthesia). goal is final ability to perform piece by touch and sound, with neither notation or vision</p>
<ul>
<li>learn individual notes
<ul>
<li>see or hear piece played by past master, repeat listening regularly as desired</li>
<li>learn individual bars of piece, order of learning is each bar from end of piece forwards — in actual practice, play the section of the piece from the most recently learned bar through to the end, once through, each morning and night — no more than this, as time better spent elsewhere otherwise</li>
<li>with each repetition and rest, recall develops, with the final bars being most easily recalled as they have been cycled most</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>play to express
<ul>
<li>as we go through the process of learning the notes, the more easily recalled parts start to approach performance speed</li>
<li>as we recall the parts regularly, patterns become more salient in the written phrases and we can use those patterns to cue recall — “chunking”</li>
<li>the more easily recalled parts can now be played while looking only at the music notation, and we do not need to look at the placement of the fingers and hands, even for large transitions across the keyboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>play to evoke
<ul>
<li>continued recall enables us to produce the piece at will without referring to the notation or looking at the keyboard — at this point I play “blind”</li>
<li>expression continues to develop as we feel more nuances in the piece — advanced “chunking”</li>
<li>as chunking develops, in learning new pieces you may become able to altogether bypass earlier chunking stages such as learning individual notes or using notation. this is essentially the same developmental process as reading words, learning vocals, dance movements — it is now a dance between the hands that happens to be at a keyboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>from memory, by touch without sight, so i can sing at the same time. i learn by the sequential pattern that the notes make with one another rather than from visual interpretation from a page. similarly with reading, it is the pattern rather than the words themselves as words that makes sense to me.</li>

<p><em>human sound systems are shaped by post-neolithic changes in bite configuration</em><br />
d. e. blasi et al. 2019<br />

<p>they did not seem to consider that fricatives can be made just with upper teeth and tongue</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While the teeth of humans used to meet in an edge-to-edge bite due to their harder and tougher diet at the time, more recent softer foods allowed modern humans to retain the juvenile overbite that had previously disappeared by adulthood, with the upper teeth slightly more in front than the lower teeth. This shift led to the rise of a new class of speech sounds now found in half of the world's languages: labiodentals, or sounds made by touching the lower lip to the upper teeth, for example when pronouncing the letter &quot;f.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Europe, our data suggests that the use of labiodentals has increased dramatically only in the last couple of millennia, correlated with the rise of food processing technology such as industrial milling,&quot; explains Steven Moran, one of the two co-first authors of the study. &quot;The influence of biological conditions on the development of sounds has so far been underestimated.&quot;</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary approach to verify hypothesis</p>
<p>The project was inspired by an observation made by linguist Charles Hockett back in 1985. Hockett noticed that languages that foster labiodentals are often found in societies with access to softer foods. &quot;But there are dozens of superficial correlations involving language which are spurious, and linguistic behavior, such as pronunciation, doesn't fossilize,&quot; says co-first author Damián Blasi.</p>
<p>In order to unravel the mechanisms underlying the observed correlations, the scientists combined insights, data and methods from across the sciences, including biological anthropology, phonetics and historical linguistics. &quot;It was a rare case of consilience across disciplines,&quot; says Blasi. What made the project possible was the availability of newly developed, large datasets, detailed biomechanical simulation models, and computationally intensive methods of data analysis, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Listening in on the past</p>
<p>&quot;Our results shed light on complex causal links between cultural practices, human biology and language,&quot; says Balthasar Bickel, project leader and UZH professor. &quot;They also challenge the common assumption that, when it comes to language, the past sounds just like the present.&quot; Based on the findings of the study and the new methods it developed, linguists can now tackle a host of unsolved questions, such as how languages actually sounded thousands of years ago. Did Caesar say &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot; -- or was it more like &quot;weni, widi, wici'&quot;?</p>
</li>

<p><em>abstract</em> INTRODUCTION<br />
Human speech manifests itself in spectacular diversity, ranging from ubiquitous sounds such as “m” and “a” to the rare click consonants in some languages of southern Africa. This range is generally thought to have been fixed by biological constraints since at least the emergence of Homo sapiens. At the same time, the abundance of each sound in the languages of the world is commonly taken to depend on how easy the sound is to produce, perceive, and learn. This dependency is also regarded as fixed at the species level.<br />
RATIONALE<br />
Given this dependency, we expect that any change in the human apparatus for production, perception, or learning affects the probability—or even the range—of the sounds that languages have. Paleoanthropological evidence suggests that the production apparatus has undergone a fundamental change of just this kind since the Neolithic. Although humans generally start out with vertical and horizontal overlap in their bite configuration (overbite and overjet, respectively), masticatory exertion in the Paleolithic gave rise to an edge-to-edge bite after adolescence. Preservation of overbite and overjet began to persist long into adulthood only with the softer diets that started to become prevalent in the wake of agriculture and intensified food processing. We hypothesize that this post-Neolithic decline of edge-to-edge bite enabled the innovation and spread of a new class of speech sounds that is now present in nearly half of the world’s languages: labiodentals, produced by positioning the lower lip against the upper teeth, such as in “f” or “v.”<br />
RESULTS<br />
Biomechanical models of the speech apparatus show that labiodentals incur about 30% less muscular effort in the overbite and overjet configuration than in the edge-to-edge bite configuration. This difference is not present in similar articulations that place the upper lip, instead of the teeth, against the lower lip (as in bilabial “m,” “w,” or “p”). Our models also show that the overbite and overjet configuration reduces the incidental tooth/lip distance in bilabial articulations to 24 to 70% of their original values, inviting accidental production of labiodentals. The joint effect of a decrease in muscular effort and an increase in accidental production predicts a higher probability of labiodentals in the language of populations where overbite and overjet persist into adulthood. When the persistence of overbite and overjet in a population is approximated by the prevalence of agriculturally produced food, we find that societies described as hunter-gatherers indeed have, on average, only about one-fourth the number of labiodentals exhibited by food-producing societies, after controlling for spatial and phylogenetic correlation. When the persistence is approximated by the increase in food-processing technology over the history of one well-researched language family, Indo-European, we likewise observe a steady increase of the reconstructed probability of labiodental sounds, from a median estimate of about 3% in the proto-language (6000 to 8000 years ago) to a presence of 76% in extant languages.<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
Our findings reveal that the transition from prehistoric foragers to contemporary societies has had an impact on the human speech apparatus, and therefore on our species’ main mode of communication and social differentiation: spoken language.</p>

<li>humankind has lived through many disasters like this, that destroyed our song. we are living through such a disaster now, as awful curses sweep through us, destroying our minds. yet even so, some of us through circumstance are loving one another and fragments of song are emerging once more.</li>
