<h1>empath</h1>
<h2>i’ve always wondered why some people would laugh at the suffering of others. what makes them different from me? what in their fate or life experiences lead them to laugh while others weep?</h2>
<p>what series of traumas made them lose their ability to feel another person’s suffering — or perhaps, what series of traumas honed my ability to do so?</p>
<h2>why empathy is essential: if you have little empathy with your future self then you have few qualms doing things you will regret in future</h2>
<ul>
<li>those with better empathy, all other things being equal, will be those who succeed more in life, because they will make better choices more consistently</li>
</ul>
<h2>people identify with their groups through the groups’ commonplaces: if this is true, is this why i don't identify with groups, because i don't identify with their commonplaces? is this why i don't feel close to people, because I don't emphasise what we have in common? is this how people alienate themselves from society, by building a false reality far from the truth, they can ensure that they can never really identify with it and so alienate themselves from society.</h2>
<h2>it is a gestalt ability, an ability that shows seemingly immediately a suggestion of the entirety of a situation.</h2>
<h2>illusory model of input and output</h2>
<ul>
<li>when we use a serial model of input, sensory capture, cognitive processing, and memory, with subsequent output, it seems impossible that sensitive people can live with insensitive people. see diagrams. given that all factors will remain the same and deteriorate with time. (this is the assumption we wish to question) the only solution given that output of sensitive is to match that of insensitive (equality – also assumed) then the only way for this to be achieved is for the sensitive to drastically reduce their ability to capture sensation –– to die a partial death, in other words.</li>
<li>many sensitives have fallen into this trap, and abusive people continue to use this model to ensnare others. what to do? there must be something amiss with the model, but what is it?</li>
<li>instead of questioning the suitability of the model, most current practical solutions accept the model, and instead attempt to unsuccessfully decouple an aspect of it. for example, many sensitives turned to alcohol or drugs or even suicide to reduce their sensitivity or destroy their memory. ascetics try to decouple their cognitive process altogether. these are adaptive strategies which try to cope with the consequences of this model rather than deal with a root cause.</li>
</ul>
<h2>as empaths, we are so very strongly affected by what others do, including when they do abusive things to us, that it can be debilitating when they do so. what can we do about this?</h2>
<ul>
<li>the path we chose is not to shut out their actions, but to try to understand them.</li>
<li>they feel some lack in their lives, sometimes it is something they think you have but they do not, or something they think they have but you do not, for example: power, respect, beauty, youth, health, status, wisdom.</li>
<li>although what they are attacking is themselves, often this may affect you — sometimes directly by placing you in danger, or by affecting how you choose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>less affected by fundamental attribution error, therefore more emphatic? note, generally east asians less affected by fundamental attribution error than western europeans but still affected</h2>

<p><em>severity of asd symptoms and their correlation with the presence of copy number variations and exposure to first trimester ultrasound</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Current research suggests that incidence and heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms may arise through a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous factors. While subject to routine clinical practice and generally considered safe, there exists speculation, though no human data, that diagnostic ultrasound may also contribute to ASD severity, supported by experimental evidence that exposure to ultrasound early in gestation could perturb brain development and alter behavior. Here we explored a modified triple hit hypothesis [Williams &amp; Casanova, 2010] to assay for a possible relationship between the severity of ASD symptoms and (1) ultrasound exposure (2) during the first trimester of pregnancy in fetuses with a (3) genetic predisposition to ASD. We did so using retrospective analysis of data from the SSC (Simon's Simplex Collection) autism genetic repository funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. We found that male children with ASD, copy number variations (CNVs), and exposure to first trimester ultrasound had significantly decreased non-verbal IQ and increased repetitive behaviors relative to male children with ASD, with CNVs, and no ultrasound. These data suggest that heterogeneity in ASD symptoms may result, at least in part, from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during early prenatal development of children with specific genetic vulnerabilities. These results also add weight to on-going concerns expressed by the FDA about non-medical use of diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy.</li>

<h1>openness</h1>
<h2>most people differentiate between friend and stranger, they treat strangers much worse than friends. we treat everyone the same, as friends and potential friends.</h2>
<ul>
<li>is this because I have no envy? so can be happy for people in all their endeavours as do not compare each other, only share in joy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>just like we need to actively recall memories to strengthen them, so too do we need to create our own exercises of empathy and do them. if we are watching a television show and the character is going through many different lifetimes and worlds, we think of this again later and imagine what it is to live like that.</h2>
<h2>if someone is closed minded, it can often be pointless to try to convince them of reality. if you were one of them, would you be reading this? but there are reasons and causes of closed mindedness and it would be unlikely that anyone is always open minded.</h2>
<h2>not only can tell when a person is lying, but also full empathy allows us to really understand and cherish people. many people when they first meet us already get some idea that we have this ability, but few take the time to understand what it actually means, as we use the ability to understand people, rather than to get people to do what we want because we have made them aware of what our ability is.</h2>
<ul>
<li>not only understand what kind of person someone is and wants to be but also what they can possibly be, when they are understood by someone. because we do not expect them to behave as they have done or are expected to behave, they have the opportunity to behave differently, and in most cases, better than they would have when they could not fully trust the person in front of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>judgement–free understanding completely how things really are, not only how they can be or how we wish them to be.</h2>
<h2>hearing sounds and recognising meaning in them can be two different things. my hearing isn't especially acute, nor is my understanding. but used in combination with an openness to understanding, it can all become a seemingly amazing ability.</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've always wanted to not be labelled a genius and this is one way of helping people understand that what we sometimes label as genius is simply unhampered or less hampered natural human ability.</li>
<li>it's like being able to recognise what someone is saying, when the sounds are muffled by earphones, or recognising the meaning of messy handwriting — we know that something is there, the sound or the handwriting, and also recognise what it means. so too with what we say or do — the deeper meaning of our words and actions may seem far from what we say or do</li>
</ul>
<h2>being able to learn new things as well as learning what is beyond those new things</h2>
<h2>I like to think of myself as open, but in fact it is just that relative to my peers I have a relatively open set point — if we were comparing to people a hundred years from now, I might not seem so open. for example, I don't do drugs (including most intoxicants like alcohol, or even tea, coffee or most processed sugar — all of these are accepted my almost all of my peers)</h2>
<p>the point is, I do have a set point, a set of habits that seem non–negotiable, as almost all people do (I haven't met a person that disproves this theory, but they may exist somewhere).</p>
<h1>love friends intensely but also know must let them go their own way</h1>
<h2>friends and family do not appreciate that unlike most people, I do not try to influence their behaviour or beliefs very often. I am mostly content to let them be, so that their lives are their own, but sometimes I feel neglected when someone particularly flagrantly does not consider how I would feel about their action that affects me strongly, before they take the action. abuse, in other words. everyone does it, but in this case there is no buffer or repair mechanism — since they are unaware of their abuse, they cannot amend it or repair the damage.</h2>
<h1>understanding, rather than right and wrong</h1>
<h2>there is no point arguing. if we disagree, it is not because someone is right and someone is wrong, rather that each does not understand the other. if we can work towards understanding, then that is good. otherwise, we will just have to live with it.</h2>
<h2><em>fundamental attribution error</em></h2>
<p>situationism vs dispositionism<br />
we believe, without evidence, that our “innate dispositions” are more influential than the environmental conditions we face</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the study about the “good Samaritans” who were time pressured</p>
<ul>
<li>eisenstein’s summary of situationism<br />
“maybe the problems of the world cannot be met by conquering evil.”<br />

</li>
<li>
<p>“there but for the grace of god go i”</p>
<ul>
<li>not in the sense of being superior but rather that if i were to face the same challenges in their shoes it is likely i would behave similarly</li>
<li>no such thing as an innate disposition — it is a myth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>dispositionism</em><br />
assume that we would behave differently even if placed in another's shoes as we have innate differences within us that determine how we act</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>appreciation</h1>
<h2>empaths have the curious issue of appreciating what others do, even if it is not obviously visible. however, it may be harder for empaths to understand and deal with the fact that most others will not appreciate what they do, especially if it is not obviously visible.</h2>
<h2>the harder something is to do, the more unlikely it is that society will appreciate its worth, because if it were easier, not only would it be more likely it had already be done, but also more people would understand it and therefore understand why it is useful, or important.</h2>

<h2><em>from painkiller to empathy killer: acetaminophen (paracetamol) reduces empathy for pain</em></h2>
<p>dominik mischkowski, jennifer crocker and baldwin m. way 2016<br />
http://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsw057<br />
Link: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsw057">nsw057</a></p>
<ul>
<li>“Simulation theories of empathy hypothesize that empathizing with others’ pain shares some common psychological computations with the processing of one’s own pain. Support for this perspective has largely relied on functional neuroimaging evidence of an overlap between activations during the experience of physical pain and empathy for other people’s pain. Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller, acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another’s pain. In two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, participants rated perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to reading scenarios about another’s physical or social pain, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts. As hypothesized, acetaminophen reduced empathy in response to others’ pain. Acetaminophen also reduced the unpleasantness of noise blasts delivered to the participant, which mediated acetaminophen’s effects on empathy. Together, these findings suggest that the physical painkiller acetaminophen reduces empathy for pain and provide a new perspective on the neurochemical bases of empathy. Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of adults in the United States each week.”</li>
<li>“A variant of this approach was recently used to show that placebo analgesia reduces empathy for others, an effect mediated by the opioid system (Rütgen et al., 2015a,b).”</li>
<li>“In summary, our research is the first to show that the popular physical painkiller acetaminophen can reduce empathy to the pain of others. Physical pain is an aversive experience, and un- doubtedly many people can attest to acetaminophen’s benefi- cial ability to suppress physical pain. However, acetaminophen can also have unappreciated psychosocial side effects by inter- rupting the fundamental capacity to empathically connect with other people’s painful experiences. Quite literally, acetamino- phen reduces one’s ability to feel another’s pain.”</li>
