<p><em>a lower limit to atmospheric co2 concentrations over the past 800,000 years</em><br />
e. d. galbraith, s. eggleston 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>…<br />
Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied widely over the glacial cycles of the past 800,000 years. But despite this variability, Antarctic ice cores have shown that CO2 concentrations were very similar during all the coldest points of these cycles. Remarkably, the recurring minimum CO2 concentrations (190  ±  7 ppm) fall on the lower bound of any known in Earth history. Here we show that although the volume of terrestrial ice sheets was normally distributed over the past 800,000 years, as might be expected from the approximately normal distribution of the orbital forcing that drove the glacial cycles, Antarctic temperatures have a strong cold mode, whereas CO2 concentrations have both a cold mode and a central mode. Although multiple explanations are possible, the recurring CO2 minima and pronounced cold modes are consistent with a strong negative feedback to decreasing CO2 that resisted further cooling on timescales shorter than 10,000 years. We suggest that one possible negative feedback is CO2-limitation of photosynthesis, either directly or via CO2-limitation of N2 fixation, which could have inhibited further lowering of CO2 by reducing carbon storage.</li>

<p><em>initiation of snowball earth with volcanic sulfur aerosol emissions</em><br />
f. a. macdonald &amp; r. wordsworth 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072335">dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072335</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We propose that the first Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth event, the Sturtian glaciation, was initiated by the injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere. Geochronological data indicate that the Natkusiak magmatic assemblage of the Franklin large igneous province coincided with onset of the Sturtian glaciation. The Natkusiak was emplaced into an evaporite basin and entrained significant quantities of sulfur, which would have led to extensive SO2 and H2S outgassing in hot convective plumes. The largest of these plumes could have penetrated the tropopause, leading to stratospheric sulfate aerosol formation and an albedo increase sufficient to force a Snowball. Radiative forcing was maximized by the equatorial location of the Franklin and the cool Neoproterozoic background climate, which would have lowered the tropopause height, increasing the rate of stratospheric aerosol injection. Our results have implications for understanding Phanerozoic mass extinction events, exoplanet habitability, and aerosol perturbations to the present-day climate.</li>

<p><em>the “dirty ice” of the mcmurdo ice shelf: analogues for biological oases during the cryogenian</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The Cryogenian (~717–636 Ma) is characterized by widespread glaciation and dramatic fluctuations in biogeochemical cycling during the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. The Snowball Earth hypothesis posits that during this period, ice‐covered oceans of more or less global extent shut down or greatly diminished photosynthesis in the marine realm. However, rather than suffering a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, fossil evidence suggests that major eukaryotic lineages survived and, indeed, the end of the Cryogenian marks the onset of a rapid diversification of eukaryotic life. Persistence of diverse life forms through glaciations is thought to have occurred in supraglacial refugia although the exact nature and full extent of such habitats remain uncertain. We present further evidence for the diversity and characteristics of supraglacial ecosystems on the McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antarctica and suggest that refugia analogous to “dirty ice,” that is debris‐covered ice shelf ecosystems, potentially provided nutrient‐rich and long‐lasting biological Cryogenian oases. We also discuss how features of the McMurdo Ice Shelf indicate that mechanisms exist whereby material can be exchanged between the shallow sea floor and the surfaces of ice shelves along continental margins, providing vectors whereby ice shelf ecosystems can nourish underlying seafloor communities and vice versa.</li>

<p><em>inclined zenith aurora over kyoto on 17 september 1770: graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Red auroras were observed in Japan during an extreme magnetic storm that occurred on 17 September 1770. We show new evidence that the red aurora extended toward the zenith of Kyoto around midnight. The basic appearance of the historical painting of the red aurora is geometrically reproduced based on the inclination of the local magnetic field and a detailed description in a newly discovered diary. The presence of the inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto suggests that the intensity of the September 1770 magnetic storm is comparable to, or slightly larger than that of the September 1859 Carrington storm.</li>

<p><em>dynamical effects of the scale invariance of the empty space: the fall of dark matter?</em><br />
andre maeder 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa92cc">http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa92cc</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The hypothesis of the scale invariance of the macroscopic empty space, which intervenes through the cosmological constant, has led to new cosmological models. They show an accelerated cosmic expansion after the initial stages and satisfy several major cosmological tests. No unknown particles are needed. Developing the weak-field approximation, we find that the here-derived equation of motion corresponding to Newton’s equation also contains a small outward acceleration term. Its order of magnitude is about ￼ Newton’s gravity (<em>￼</em> being the mean density of the system and ￼ the usual critical density). The new term is thus particularly significant for very low density systems. A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For the Coma Cluster and Abell 2029, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5–10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to leave no room for dark matter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation corresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. It implies some secular variations of the orbital parameters. The results are applied to the rotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way. Starting backward from the present rotation curve, we calculate the past evolution of the Galactic rotation and find that, in the early stages, it was steep and Keplerian. Thus, the flat rotation curves of galaxies appear as an age effect, a result consistent with recent observations of distant galaxies by Genzel et al. and Lang et al. Finally, in an appendix we also study the long-standing problem of the increase with age of the vertical velocity dispersion in the Galaxy. The observed increase appears to result from the new small acceleration term in the equation of the harmonic oscillator describing stellar motions around the Galactic plane. Thus, we tend to conclude that neither dark energy nor dark matter seems to be needed in the proposed theoretical context.</li>

<p><em>anomalous k-pg–aged seafloor attributed to impact-induced mid-ocean ridge magmatism</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Eruptive phenomena at all scales, from hydrothermal geysers to flood basalts, can potentially be initiated or modulated by external mechanical perturbations. We present evidence for the triggering of magmatism on a global scale by the Chicxulub meteorite impact at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, recorded by transiently increased crustal production at mid-ocean ridges. Concentrated positive free-air gravity and coincident seafloor topographic anomalies, associated with seafloor created at fast-spreading rates, suggest volumes of excess magmatism in the range of ~105 to 106 km3. Widespread mobilization of existing mantle melt by post-impact seismic radiation can explain the volume and distribution of the anomalous crust. This massive but short-lived pulse of marine magmatism should be considered alongside the Chicxulub impact and Deccan Traps as a contributor to geochemical anomalies and environmental changes at K-Pg time.</li>

<p><em>postimpact earliest paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (el kef, tunisia)</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub impact, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the impact’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sections that both contain suitable material for traditional carbonate-based or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales. We address the problem by analyzing the oxygen isotopic composition of fish debris, phosphatic microfossils that are relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration, from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at El Kef, Tunisia. We report an ~1‰ decrease in δ18O values (~5°C warming) beginning at the boundary and spanning ~300 cm of section (~100,000 years). The pattern found matches expectations for impact-initiated greenhouse warming.</li>

<p><em>magmatic crystal records in time, space, and process, causatively linked with volcanic unrest</em><br />

<p>•Olivine crystals are used to retrieve chemical and chronological information.<br />
•A dynamic petrogenetic scenario is proposed to account for disequilibrium patterns.<br />
•Scenario is deterministic and has greater explanatory power than magma mixing.<br />
•Detailed temporal and spatial information at the volcanic plumbing system scale.<br />
•Remarkable agreement with geodetic (real-time remote sensing) data.</p>
<p>How a volcano has behaved throughout its past is a guide to its future behaviour. Detailed knowledge of what preceded eruptions from specific volcanoes, and how this can be recognised in real-time, are pivotal questions of this field. Here, the physical history of the magma that erupted in 2010 from the flank of Eyjafjallajökull volcano, Iceland, is reconstructed in absolute time and space using only chemical records from erupted crystals. The details of this reconstruction include the number of magma bodies, their geometry, their depth, their relative inflation rate and changes to all of the aforementioned through time. Petrology and geodesy (data gathered in real-time) arrive at the same set of conclusions. As such, we report detailed agreement, which demonstrates a causative link between knowledge determined post-eruption via a physical–chemical perspective and knowledge gained syn-eruption from monitoring signals.</p>

<p><em>maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water</em><br />
kyung hwan kim et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</li>

<p><em>ephemeral collision complexes mediate chemically termolecular transformations that affect system chemistry</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Termolecular association reactions involve ephemeral collision complexes—formed from the collision of two molecules—that collide with a third and chemically inert ‘bath gas’ molecule that simply transfers energy to/from the complex. These collision complexes are generally not thought to react chemically on collision with a third molecule in the gas-phase systems of combustion and planetary atmospheres. Such ‘chemically termolecular’ reactions, in which all three molecules are involved in bond making and/or breaking, were hypothesized long ago in studies establishing radical chain branching mechanisms, but were later concluded to be unimportant. Here, with data from <em>ab initio</em> master equation and kinetic-transport simulations, we reveal that reactions of H + O2 collision complexes with other radicals constitute major kinetic pathways under common combustion situations. These reactions are also found to influence flame propagation speeds, a common measure of global reactivity. Analogous chemically termolecular reactions mediated by ephemeral collision complexes are probably of significance in various combustion and planetary environments.</li>

<li>how can we tell whether there is something outside our universe within which we reside?
<ul>
<li>(originally from many years before this, but forgotten when that was except that it was in london and jenny and i were about to get on a bus when i was trying to convince her of this analogy)</li>
<li>from idea of cosmological constants not being the same across the universe, in an analogous way to gravity not being the same across the earth's surface, we can build an analogy to &quot;map what lies outside the universe&quot;.</li>
<li>imagine we are on a cruise ship, playing tennis. we are moving upon the ocean, but if we cannot see it, and discount the effects of wind and waves, we could postulate that we are not moving, that in fact we are playing tennis on a completely stationary surface.</li>
<li>to detect that we are in fact moving, we could use the variations in the strength of gravity that naturally exist to show that we have a direction and a speed i.e. we are moving with a certain velocity.</li>
<li>in an analogous way, if we could map the values of cosmological constants across the universe, and observe how they varied with time, we may be able to distinguish features of what is beyond the universe.</li>
<li>some articles i have since come across that might support this kind of experiment</li>
<li>http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19429–laws–of–physics–may–change–across–the–universe.html</li>

<li>&quot;The clusters are heading toward a 20–degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela.</li>
<li>What's more, this motion is constant out to at least a billion light–years. &quot;Because the dark flow already extends so far, it likely extends across the visible universe.&quot;</li>

<li>i wonder, could it be that the so–called second law of thermodynamics is not actually real? what if the tendency is towards diversity, rather than uniformity? could it be that in a sea of low entropy, higher entropy can spontaneously arise? if it weren't for neutrinos impinging on the experiment, this experiment could be done in a laboratory. might it be that because everyone is expecting entropy to increase, then they only see that it does? for example, by setting up the initial condition to be one of high entropy, we are not likely to see a move to even higher entropy, only towards lower entropy. but if we set up the initial condition to be one of low entropy…</li>
