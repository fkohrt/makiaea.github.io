<p>We explored an aspect of the life-world of extreme sports participants from a phenomeno-logical perspective. We focused on describing the ineffable element of the extreme sport ex-perience. However, any attempt to describe the indescribable immediately reduces the intensity and power of such an experience to defined, bound verbalizations and conceptualizations. Attempts to clarify certain experiences poten-tially results in the experience being lost, or, perhaps worse still, being obliterated in the pro-cess. A contemporary phenomenologist, van</p>

•TDPs vitrify, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities</p>
<p>Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses, including desiccation. How tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than 250 years. Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation. Here we show that tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance. TDP genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species. TDPs are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance, and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems. TDPs form non-crystalline amorphous solids (vitrify) upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities. Our study identifies TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance, expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance.</p>

<p><em>hormetic heat stress and hsf-1 induce autophagy to improve survival and proteostasis in c. elegans</em><br />

<li>Stress-response pathways have evolved to maintain cellular homeostasis and to ensure the survival of organisms under changing environmental conditions. Whereas severe stress is detrimental, mild stress can be beneficial for health and survival, known as hormesis. Although the universally conserved heat-shock response regulated by transcription factor HSF-1 has been implicated as an effector mechanism, the role and possible interplay with other cellular processes, such as autophagy, remains poorly understood. Here we show that autophagy is induced in multiple tissues of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> following hormetic heat stress or HSF-1 overexpression. Autophagy-related genes are required for the thermoresistance and longevity of animals exposed to hormetic heat shock or HSF-1 overexpression. Hormetic heat shock also reduces the progressive accumulation of PolyQ aggregates in an autophagy-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that autophagy contributes to stress resistance and hormesis, and reveal a requirement for autophagy in HSF-1-regulated functions in the heat-shock response, proteostasis and ageing.</li>

<p><em>lost in time and space: states of high arousal disrupt implicit acquisition of spatial and sequential context information</em><br />
thomas maran et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00206">dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00206</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Biased cognition during high arousal states is a relevant phenomenon in a variety of topics: from the development of post-traumatic stress disorders or stress-triggered addictive behaviors to forensic considerations regarding crimes of passion. Recent evidence indicates that arousal modulates the engagement of a hippocampus-based “cognitive” system in favor of a striatum-based “habit” system in learning and memory, promoting a switch from flexible, contextualized to more rigid, reflexive responses. Existing findings appear inconsistent, therefore it is unclear whether and which type of context processing is disrupted by enhanced arousal. In this behavioral study, we investigated such arousal-triggered cognitive-state shifts in human subjects. We validated an arousal induction procedure (three experimental conditions: violent scene, erotic scene, neutral control scene) using pupillometry (Preliminary Experiment, <em>n</em> = 13) and randomly administered this method to healthy young adults to examine whether high arousal states affect performance in two core domains of contextual processing, the acquisition of spatial (spatial discrimination paradigm; Experiment 1, <em>n</em> = 66) and sequence information (learned irrelevance paradigm; Experiment 2, <em>n</em> = 84). In both paradigms, spatial location and sequences were encoded incidentally and both displacements when retrieving spatial position as well as the predictability of the target by a cue in sequence learning changed stepwise. Results showed that both implicit spatial and sequence learning were disrupted during high arousal states, regardless of valence. Compared to the control group, participants in the arousal conditions showed impaired discrimination of spatial positions and abolished learning of associative sequences. Furthermore, Bayesian analyses revealed evidence against the null models. In line with recent models of stress effects on cognition, both experiments provide evidence for decreased engagement of flexible, cognitive systems supporting encoding of context information in active cognition during acute arousal, promoting reduced sensitivity for contextual details. We argue that arousal fosters cognitive adaptation towards less demanding, more present-oriented information processing, which prioritizes a current behavioral response set at the cost of contextual cues. This transient state of behavioral perseverance might reduce reliance on context information in unpredictable environments and thus represent an adaptive response in certain situations.</li>

<li>when caring for someone, for example someone who has mental health issues, you must care for yourself first. this is not because you love yourself more, but because if you are not capable, you will not be capable of looking after them either. it is the same rationale that adults must put on their oxygen masks on before helping the children do theirs — it is time–critical as you can lose consciousness very quickly, so to be able to look after the child past the initial problem, you must be conscious to do so, so you must put on your mask first.</li>

<li>i use obstacles to hone my creativity, adapting skills
<ul>
<li>this is good because most obstacles are caused by self-righteous people. no one has changed in my experience just because they were shown to be wrong; end up hbing to work around the obstacle they present on those issues</li>

<li>exactly those things or processes that are most challenging for us to face are exactly those that we most need to face — by definition, they could not be most challenging if we could face them easily</li>

<li>imagine, for just a minute, that I suddenly make a small sphere of force right here in this room. you can see it has disintegrated a chunk of the desk. you hear the crackle as the air and dust passing at its boundary disappears, you feel the soft breeze of the disappearing air raise the hairs on the back of your neck, you smell the sharp smell of molecules ripped apart, and feel a tingle, a rumble, even, of a force you don't understand.</li>
<li>now the response of most of those of you reading this might be “what is that?” or “how is that done?” — a civilised response, but precisely the wrong one. “why is it wrong?” you might ask. well, just imagine also that this sphere is growing a little, or maybe it just seems so because it is moving towards you.</li>
<li>you will have many examples from your own experience that show how people can be very wrong, even when we believe we are right. and much of the time, this doesn't matter — we muddle through regardless. but just sometimes, just enough times to matter, our errors have very bad consequences.</li>
<li>sadly, even those errors that didn't seem to matter, turn out to matter.</li>

<ul>
<li>it isn’t that ‘bad’ situations bring out the ‘best’ in people — it is that extreme situations are where the necessary ability to survive and thrive shows in the people who happen to have those latent abilities that match the particular situation</li>
<li>if people could do any better right now, don’t you think we would be doing it? yet also, how we are doing now need not determine how we do in future — just because we are not doing better right now, is no excuse for not doing better in future</li>
