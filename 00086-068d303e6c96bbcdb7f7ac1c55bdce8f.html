<p><em>against civility, or why habermas recommends a wild public sphere</em><br />

<p>“democracy, according to habermas, requires a vibrant political sphere and political institutions that are able to respond to and incorporate the energy that arises from debate, protest, confrontation and politics. perhaps it’s not citizens who have become unreasonable. rather, their leaders have too long refused to listen, instead treating the public as nothing more than a periodic reservoir of votes, an obstacle to be managed on the path to smooth, technocratic governance.”</p>

<p><em>’it’s so cute i could crush it!’: understanding neural mechanisms of cute aggression</em><br />
katherine k. m. stavropoulos, laura a. alba 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00300">http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00300</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stavropoulos said she first heard the term &quot;cute aggression&quot; after a team of Yale University psychologists released research related to the phenomenon in 2015. </p>
<p>&quot;The Yale researchers initially found that people reported feeling cute aggression more in response to baby animals versus adult animals,&quot; Stavropoulos said. &quot;But even beyond that, people reported feeling cute aggression more in response to picture of human babies that had been digitally enhanced to appear more infantile, and therefore 'more cute,' by enlarging features like their eyes, cheeks, and foreheads.&quot;</p>
<p>After poring over the Yale research, Stavropoulos wondered whether there was a neural component to cute aggression. If people reported experiencing urges to squeeze, crush, or even bite creatures they found cute, would their brains also reflect patterns of activity that could be tied to those urges?</p>
<p>Stavropoulos hypothesized that the brains of people who reported experiencing cute aggression would, in fact, provide evidence of detectable activity. She suggested the activity might be related to the brain's reward system, which deals with motivation, feelings of &quot;wanting,&quot; and pleasure, or to its emotion system, which handles emotional processing -- or, more likely, to both. </p>
<p>Stavropoulos and UCR doctoral student Laura Alba recruited 54 study participants between the ages of 18 and 40, all of whom agreed to wear caps outfitted with electrodes. While wearing the caps, participants looked at four blocks of 32 photographs divided into categories: </p>
<p>Cute (enhanced) babies<br />
Less cute (non-enhanced) babies<br />
Cute (baby) animals<br />
Less cute (adult) animals<br />
After viewing each block on a computer screen, participants were then shown a set of statements and asked to rate how much they agreed with them on a scale of 1 to 10. </p>
<p>The survey was designed to assess how cute participants found each block of photographs -- known as &quot;appraisal&quot; -- and how much cute aggression they were experiencing in response. Participants also rated how overwhelmed they felt after viewing the photos (&quot;I can't handle it!&quot; and &quot;I can't stand it!&quot;) and whether they felt compelled to take care of what they had just viewed (&quot;I want to hold it!&quot; and &quot;I want to protect it!&quot;). </p>
<p>Stavropoulos said the statements were the same ones used in Yale researcher Oriana Aragón's groundbreaking 2015 study of cute aggression.</p>
<p>Overall, participants self-reported more significant feelings of cute aggression, being overwhelmed, appraisal, and caretaking toward cute (baby) animals than toward less cute (adult) animals. Among the two categories of babies -- cute (enhanced) and less cute (non-enhanced) -- the researchers did not observe the same pattern. </p>
<p>Using electrophysiology, Stavropoulos also measured study participants' brain activity before, during, and after viewing the sets of images. To her knowledge, the study's results, published this week in the journal Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, are the first to confirm a neural basis for cute aggression. </p>
<p>Based on the neural activity she observed in participants who experienced cute aggression, Stavropoulos's findings offer direct evidence of both the brain's reward system and emotion system being involved in the phenomenon.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an especially strong correlation between ratings of cute aggression experienced toward cute animals and the reward response in the brain toward cute animals,&quot; Stavropoulos said. &quot;This is an exciting finding, as it confirms our original hypothesis that the reward system is involved in people's experiences of cute aggression.&quot; </p>
<p>Another result that Stavropoulos said lends weight to prior theories: The relationship between how cute something is and how much cute aggression someone experiences toward it appears to be tied to how overwhelmed that person is feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;Essentially, for people who tend to experience the feeling of 'not being able to take how cute something is,' cute aggression happens,&quot; Stavropoulos said. &quot;Our study seems to underscore the idea that cute aggression is the brain's way of 'bringing us back down' by mediating our feelings of being overwhelmed.&quot;</p>
<p>Stavropoulos likened this process of mediation to an evolutionary adaptation. Such an adaptation may have developed as a means of ensuring people are able to continue taking care of creatures they consider particularly cute.  </p>
<p>&quot;For example, if you find yourself incapacitated by how cute a baby is -- so much so that you simply can't take care of it -- that baby is going to starve,&quot; Stavropoulos said. &quot;Cute aggression may serve as a tempering mechanism that allows us to function and actually take care of something we might first perceive as overwhelmingly cute.&quot;</p>
<p>In the future, Stavropoulos hopes to use electrophysiology to study the neural bases of cute aggression in a variety of populations and groups, such as mothers with postpartum depression, people with autism spectrum disorder, and participants with and without babies or pets. </p>
<p>&quot;I think if you have a child and you're looking at pictures of cute babies, you might exhibit more cute aggression and stronger neural reactions,&quot; she said. &quot;The same could be true for people who have pets and are looking pictures of cute puppies or other small animals.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> The urge people get to squeeze or bite cute things, albeit without desire to cause harm, is known as “cute aggression.” Using electrophysiology (ERP), we measured components related to emotional salience and reward processing. Participants aged 18–40 years (n = 54) saw four sets of images: cute babies, less cute babies, cute (baby) animals, and less cute (adult) animals. On measures of cute aggression, feeling overwhelmed by positive emotions, approachability, appraisal of cuteness, and feelings of caretaking, participants rated more cute animals significantly higher than less cute animals. There were significant correlations between participants’ self-report of behaviors related to cute aggression and ratings of cute aggression in the current study.</p>
<p>N200: A significant effect of “cuteness” was observed for animals such that a larger N200 was elicited after more versus less cute animals. A significant correlation between N200 amplitude and the tendency to express positive emotions in a dimorphous manner (e.g., crying when happy) was observed.</p>
<p>RewP: For animals and babies separately, we subtracted the less cute condition from the more cute condition. A significant correlation was observed between RewP amplitude to cute animals and ratings of cute aggression toward cute animals. RewP amplitude was used in mediation models.</p>
<p>Mediation Models: Using PROCESS (Hayes, 2018), mediation models were run. For both animals and babies, the relationship between appraisal and cute aggression was significantly mediated by feeling overwhelmed. For cute animals, the relationship between N200 amplitude and cute aggression was significantly mediated by feeling overwhelmed. For cute animals, there was significant serial mediation for RewP amplitude through caretaking, to feeling overwhelmed, to cute aggression, and RewP amplitude through appraisal, to feeling overwhelmed, to cute aggression. Our results indicate that feelings of cute aggression relate to feeling overwhelmed and feelings of caretaking. In terms of neural mechanisms, cute aggression is related to both reward processing and emotional salience.</p>

<li>
<p>somewhere out there<br />
beneath the pale moonlight<br />
someone’s thinking of me<br />
and loving me tonight</p>
<p>somewhere out there<br />
someone’s saying a prayer<br />
that we’ll find one another<br />
in that big somewhere out there</p>
<p>and even though i know how very far apart we are<br />
it helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star</p>
<p>and when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby<br />
it helps to think we’re sleeping underneath the same big sky</p>
<p>somewhere out there<br />
if love can see us through<br />
then we’ll be together<br />
somewhere out there<br />
out where dreams come true</p>
