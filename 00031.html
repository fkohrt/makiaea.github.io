<h1>learning</h1>
<h2>when someone no longer wants to learn, or no longer has the ability to learn, then you can only reason with them based on their current knowledge, rather than on what they might be learning or the trends in their knowledge. this makes most reasoning fruitless because they do not wish to learn knowledge that would enable them to understand beyond what they already know, and can thus only act according to their set patterns rather than more appropriately or responsibly to reality</h2>
<h2>similarly if they follow restrictive belief structures and authorities then they will be limited to those courses of belief and action</h2>
<h2>what is learning? how do we come to appreciate something may be true when we previously believed it was not true or even did not know of the possibility that such a thing could even occur?</h2>
<ul>
<li>because they are stuck in the logic of their current position, they can't yet learn to change their opinion on a topic. this is the crux of the issue and also of how we learn and change and grow.</li>
<li>is this the process which becomes more difficult as we become older? not the learning itself but the removal of the baggage, the conscious logical structures we have built up through long experience is more and more consuming the energy that could have gone into the process of acceptance?</li>
<li>this is the very same issue as Socrates is held to expose in the Apology: how to help others learn what they do not already know, when they may hold power over you, power that may be abusive and inimical?</li>
<li>currently, thinking is about conscious thinking in our society, not about thinking which cannot be described or transmitted in words. is it possible to improve that kind of thinking that we cannot describe? I believe it is not only possible but imperative to do so</li>
</ul>

<h2>trust in your ability to learn</h2>
<ul>
<li>trust in your ability to learn. when using an srs (spaced repetition system), do not beat yourself up if you do not remember something perfectly, it will come with time and exposure, when we continue with practice. like all tools, if we use it in one of the ways in which it works well, we can get good results.</li>
<li>for me it simulates immersion, in a focused way which concentrates on the topics I have a wish to remember and have chosen to learn, but which prompts and jogs memory at close to the time I was about to forget. in this way, eventually I build a memory for these particular topics which is easily recalled.</li>
<li>most people start off wanting to learn, until someone they trust tells them they shouldn't.</li>
<li>most of when we get lost is because of a lack of context. we learn best when we have that context</li>
</ul>
<h2>finding data — most salient often not most important</h2>
<ul>
<li>essential data from trends and unspoken communication rather than from loudest voice — what is most salient is often not what is most important. journal to track trends in personal life over time. direct experience rather than just through reports and measurement. unusual data can indicate trend not as it seems. repeat, re–evaluate to tack towards moving destination rather than away. play, imagining, improvising, openness, sleep and other unconscious flow to be vulnerable, flexible, creative. play as antidote to stress — drawing, singing, piano — happiness you knew as child.</li>
</ul>
<h2>is all learning perceptual — beyond our conscious comprehension — and only explainable retrospectively in words and concepts? in other words, are our ideas of learning all very far from reality?</h2>
<h2>how to approach learning in a open way. be aware that everything has advantages as well as disadvantages. allow yourself to absorb the information about it, while letting your inner experience be your guide rather than what people try to convince you is right. but for this to work you will need to question and change your inner experience often and regularly.</h2>
<h2>the person who organises information so that it can be more readily used and understood, this person is currently undervalued in our society.</h2>
<h2>do all the experiments you need to before you sleep, so that your unconscious mind can play with the data and patterns freely.</h2>
<h2>learning useful habits</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ego depletion is nothing of the sort. besides evidence that non glucose stimulation at the point of “depletion” can revive the subject, it may not even be the question of glucose depletion versus mental depletion.</p>
<p>it may instead be the difference between our habits and changing them. when we spend time doing strange new things or actively changing habits, tendency towards the mean or tendency towards equilibrium would suggest that the next action would be a habitual one rather than another change of habit. so it may be that the key to increase level of performance is to accumulate better general habits and review and maintain them.</p>
<p>it may be that the default behaviour selected by evolution is to follow habit changes with old habits or rest, to make sure we do not go too far astray in a short period</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>understanding the history of a language and a culture is an important part of learning how to communicate fully in that language and culture. the assumptions that are made depend not only on present circumstances but also on history and expectations.</h2>
<h2>few things are as they seem in this world. a book like this, seemingly innocent, screams danger to those who crave power. it is not because the book is inherently dangerous, but because any learning is a threat to power. and the more effective the learning, the more effective the threat.</h2>
<h2>how to learn without needing direct experience.</h2>
<h2>it depends on where you apply the effort. if you apply the effort once you have neared mastery of the initial skill, then the effort applied will likely gain you a better return on the new skill than on the old. in any case your brain will likely be unable not to reinforce the old skill while you are learning the new.</h2>
<ul>
<li>this is how it is possible to be great at many things, not just a few.</li>
<li>less frustration because we see big results more often. we also have many projects going, at different stages of progress and will always have some in deeply–absorbing stages to immerse ourselves in when we want to do so.</li>
<li>importance of level of persistence in face of currently low skill in learning new task/reading new book/absorbing new information</li>

<h2>i take it for granted that people want to learn, because we all do unless circumstances lead us to believe it is better not to.</h2>
<h2>learning: create structure. some paradigms are information, existence, processes.</h2>
<h2>our educations are about learning to think, but we also need to unlearn, to learn to unthink.</h2>
<h2>we need to avoid accepting blindly all which authority seeks to impose on us. this is not questioning authority, rather it is seeking reality.</h2>
<h2>sadly, by the time we realise that we have stopped wanting to learn, it is sometimes too late to reverse the process — when you need someone to justify to you that you should learn something, instead of finding out for yourself, you have already lost your will to improve</h2>
<h2>if time is our ultimate constraint then knowledge is one of the releases from it — knowledge does not always need to be gathered by each person on their own, it can be passed (partially) from person to person at a fraction of the cost of gathering it ourselves, and in the process builds conceptual frameworks we could not otherwise raise on our own</h2>
<h2>real learning is not about understanding some perfect structure or path but about the little fragments that stick and that we use in our reconstruction, that give hints towards progress and ledges from which we leap in our perception</h2>
<h2>why is it important to try to learn better? when we do not, we are stuck with the beliefs and attitudes we already have. we interpret our life experiences with the beliefs we hold — if those beliefs are very far from reality, the lessons we learn from our experiences will be as far from reality</h2>
<h2>learning vs “education”</h2>

<h2>is the major factor that enables me to learn such a broad range of things that i am unafraid to not be an expert yet still work towards big projects such as transcribing books written in ancient greek (when at first i knew no ancient greek)?</h2>
<ul>
<li>in other words, by approaching learning as a child might, as one who has not yet been brainwashed to believe that they should only do what they already know?</li>
