<p><em>black box thinking: why most people never learn from their mistakes, but some do</em><br />
matthew syed 2015<br />

<ul>
<li>sadly this book often still misses the crucial point that what is omitted from the premisses may be critical to conclusions based on reality.</li>
<li>“Failure is thus a signpost. It reveals a feature of our world we hadn’t grasped fully and offers vital clues about how to update our models, strategies, and behaviors”</li>
<li>“They were only considering the planes that had returned. They were not taking into account the planes that had not returned (i.e., the planes that had been shot down). The observable bullet holes suggested that the area around the cockpit and tail didn’t need reinforcing because it was never hit. In fact, the planes that were hit in these places were crashing because this is where they were most vulnerable.”</li>
<li>sullenberger “Everything we know in aviation, every rule in the rule book, every procedure we have, we know because someone somewhere died . . . We have purchased at great cost, lessons literally bought with blood that we have to preserve as institutional knowledge and pass on to succeeding generations. We cannot have the moral failure of forgetting these lessons and have to relearn them.”</li>
<li>This also reveals a subtle asymmetry between confirmation and falsification, between success and failure. If you are careful enough to limit your observations to low altitudes and open containers, you could find countless instances where water does indeed boil at 100ºC. But none of this successful “evidence” would have expanded our knowledge very much. Indeed, in one sense, it would not have even increased the probability of the assertion “water always boils at 100ºC.”</li>
<li>This point was originally made by the Scottish philosopher David Hume in the eighteenth century, and popularized recently by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the mathematician and author. Taleb has pointed out that you could observe a million white swans, but this would not prove the proposition: all swans are white. The observation of a single black swan, on the other hand, would conclusively demonstrate its falsehood.</li>

<li>“Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative.”</li>
<li>David Bayles and Ted Orland, Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking (New York: Image Continuum Press, 2001).</li>
<li>“In their book Art and Fear David Bayles and Ted Orland tell the story of a ceramics teacher who announced on the opening day of class that he was dividing the students into two groups. Half were told that they would be graded on quantity. On the final day of term, the teacher said he would come to class with some scales and weigh the pots they had made. They would get an “A” for 50 lbs of pots, a “B” for 40 lbs, and so on. The other half would be graded on quality. They just had to bring along their one, perfect pot.</li>
<li>The results were emphatic: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group graded for quantity. As Bayles and Orland put it: “It seems that while the ‘quantity’ group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the ‘quality’ group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”</li>

<li>Our review of the learning-styles literature led us to define a particular type of evidence that we see as a minimum precondition for validating the use of a learning-style assessment in an instructional setting. As described earlier, we have been unable to find any evidence that clearly meets this standard. Moreover, several studies that used the appropriate type of research design found results that contradict the most widely held version of the learning-styles hypothesis, namely, what we have referred to as the meshing hypothesis (Constantinidou &amp; Baker, 2002; Massa &amp; Mayer, 2006). The contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning-styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is, in our opinion, striking and disturbing. If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility, it remains to be demonstrated.</li>

<p><em>dispelling the myth: training in education or neuroscience decreases but does not eliminate beliefs in neuromyths</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Thus, the integration of multiple modalities can be beneficial for learning and this practice is conflated with the learning styles neuromyth. In other words, this particular neuromyth presents a challenge to the education field because it seems to be supporting effective instructional practice, but for the wrong reasons. To dispel this particular myth might inadvertently discourage diversity in instructional approaches if it is not paired with explicit discussion of the distinctions between learning styles theory and multimodal instruction.</li>
<li>Another limitation of the true/false paradigm is that we cannot discern participants' certainty of their answers because we did not include an “I don't know” answer choice.</li>
<li>Neuromyths are misconceptions about brain research and its application to education and learning. Previous research has shown that these myths may be quite pervasive among educators, but less is known about how these rates compare to the general public or to individuals who have more exposure to neuroscience. This study is the first to use a large sample from the United States to compare the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among educators, the general public, and individuals with high neuroscience exposure. Neuromyth survey responses and demographics were gathered via an online survey hosted at TestMyBrain.org. We compared performance among the three groups of interest: educators (<em>N</em> = 598), high neuroscience exposure (<em>N</em> = 234), and the general public (<em>N</em> = 3,045) and analyzed predictors of individual differences in neuromyths performance. In an exploratory factor analysis, we found that a core group of 7 “classic” neuromyths factored together (items related to learning styles, dyslexia, the Mozart effect, the impact of sugar on attention, right-brain/left-brain learners, and using 10% of the brain). The general public endorsed the greatest number of neuromyths (<em>M</em> = 68%), with significantly fewer endorsed by educators (<em>M</em> = 56%), and still fewer endorsed by the high neuroscience exposure group (<em>M</em> = 46%). The two most commonly endorsed neuromyths across all groups were related to learning styles and dyslexia. More accurate performance on neuromyths was predicted by age (being younger), education (having a graduate degree), exposure to neuroscience courses, and exposure to peer-reviewed science. These findings suggest that training in education and neuroscience can help reduce but does not eliminate belief in neuromyths. We discuss the possible underlying roots of the most prevalent neuromyths and implications for classroom practice. These empirical results can be useful for developing comprehensive training modules for educators that target general misconceptions about the brain and learning.</li>

<p><em>when intuitive conceptions overshadow pedagogical content knowledge: teachers’ conceptions of students’ arithmetic word problem solving strategies</em><br />

<li>Intuitive conceptions in mathematics guide the interpretation of mathematical concepts. We investigated if they bias teachers’ conceptions of student arithmetic word problem solving strategies, which should be part of their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In individual interviews, teachers and non-teaching adults were asked to describe students’ strategies in situational contexts within or outside the scope of the intuitive conception. The results revealed that teachers relied on their PCK and identified student strategies; however, in the presence of the intuitive conception, their PCK was overshadowed and they ceased to differ significantly from non-teachers. This brings the attention to certain biases that can have a strong impact on teachers’ efficient use of PCK.</li>

<li>Working memory (WM) is the ability to maintain and manipulate task-relevant information in the absence of sensory input. While its improvement through training is of great interest, the degree to which WM training transfers to untrained WM tasks (near transfer) and other untrained cognitive skills (far transfer) remains debated and the mechanism(s) underlying transfer are unclear. Here we hypothesized that a critical feature of dual n-back training is its reliance on maintaining relational information in WM. In experiment 1, using an individual differences approach, we found evidence that performance on an n-back task was predicted by performance on a measure of relational WM (i.e., WM for vertical spatial relationships independent of absolute spatial locations), whereas the same was not true for a complex span WM task. In experiment 2, we tested the idea that reliance on relational WM is critical to produce transfer from n-back but not complex span task training. Participants completed adaptive training on either a dual n-back task, a symmetry span task, or on a non-WM active control task. We found evidence of near transfer for the dual n-back group; however, far transfer to a measure of fluid intelligence did not emerge. Recording EEG during a separate WM transfer task, we examined group-specific, training-related changes in alpha power, which are proposed to be sensitive to WM demands and top-down modulation of WM. Results indicated that the dual n-back group showed significantly greater frontal alpha power after training compared to before training, more so than both other groups. However, we found no evidence of improvement on measures of relational WM for the dual n-back group, suggesting that near transfer may not be dependent on relational WM. These results suggest that dual n-back and complex span task training may differ in their effectiveness to elicit near transfer as well as in the underlying neural changes they facilitate.</li>

<li>Working memory is a construct of primary relevance to many areas of psychology. Two types of tasks have been used to measure working memory, primarily in different research areas: Complex span tasks are commonly used in behavioral studies in the cognitive and individual-differences literature, whereas <em>n</em>-back tasks have been used more frequently in cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neural underpinnings of working memory. Despite both categories of tasks being labeled as “working memory” measures, previous empirical studies have provided mixed evidence regarding the shared amount of overlapping processes between complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present meta-analysis showed that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are weakly correlated, although significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. A follow-up analysis of unpublished data indicated that the sample composition affects the relationship between the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks, following the law of diminishing returns. Finally, a separate meta-analysis indicated that the simple span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are correlated to the same extent as are the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present findings indicate that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks cannot be used interchangeably as working memory measures in research applications.</li>

<li>Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control.</li>

<li>Quality preschool programs that develop the whole child through age-appropriate socioemotional and cognitive skill-building hold promise for significantly improving child outcomes. However, preschool programs tend to either be teacher-led and didactic, or else to lack academic content. One preschool model that involves both child-directed, freely chosen activity and academic content is Montessori. Here we report a longitudinal study that took advantage of randomized lottery-based admission to two public Montessori magnet schools in a high-poverty American city. The final sample included 141 children, 70 in Montessori and 71 in other schools, most of whom were tested 4 times over 3 years, from the first semester to the end of preschool (ages 3–6), on a variety of cognitive and socio-emotional measures. Montessori preschool elevated children’s outcomes in several ways. Although not different at the first test point, over time the Montessori children fared better on measures of academic achievement, social understanding, and mastery orientation, and they also reported relatively more liking of scholastic tasks. They also scored higher on executive function when they were 4. In addition to elevating overall performance on these measures, Montessori preschool also equalized outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes. First, the difference in academic achievement between lower income Montessori and higher income conventionally schooled children was smaller at each time point, and was not (statistically speaking) significantly different at the end of the study. Second, defying the typical finding that executive function predicts academic achievement, in Montessori classrooms children with lower executive function scored as well on academic achievement as those with higher executive function. This suggests that Montessori preschool has potential to elevate and equalize important outcomes, and a larger study of public Montessori preschools is warranted.</li>

<li>Dendritic messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and subsequent local translation in dendrites critically contributes to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Little is known, however, about the contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to these processes in vivo.<br />
Results<br />
To delineate the role of the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (Stau2), we generate a transgenic rat model, in which Stau2 expression is conditionally silenced by Cre-inducible expression of a microRNA (miRNA) targeting Stau2 mRNA in adult forebrain neurons. Known physiological mRNA targets for Stau2, such as <em>RhoA</em>, <em>Complexin 1</em>, and <em>Rgs4</em> mRNAs, are found to be dysregulated in brains of Stau2-deficient rats. In vivo electrophysiological recordings reveal synaptic strengthening upon stimulation, showing a shift in the frequency-response function of hippocampal synaptic plasticity to favor long-term potentiation and impair long-term depression in Stau2-deficient rats. These observations are accompanied by deficits in hippocampal spatial working memory, spatial novelty detection, and in tasks investigating associative learning and memory.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Together, these experiments reveal a critical contribution of Stau2 to various forms of synaptic plasticity including spatial working memory and cognitive management of new environmental information. These findings might contribute to the development of treatments for conditions associated with learning and memory deficits.</li>

<li>Adolescence is associated with enhanced striatal activity in response to rewards. This has been linked to increased risk-taking behavior and negative health outcomes. However, striatal activity is also important for learning, yet it is unknown whether heightened striatal responses in adolescence also benefit cognitive learning performance. In this longitudinal fMRI study (736 scans spanning 5 years in participants ages 8–29), we investigate whether adolescents show enhanced striatal activity during feedback learning, and whether this enhanced activity is associated with better learning performance. Here we report that neural activity indicating sensitivity to informative value of feedback peaks in late adolescence and occurs in dorsal caudate, ventral caudate, and nucleus accumbens. Increased activity in dorsal and ventral caudate predicts better current and future learning performance. This suggests that enhanced striatal activity in adolescents is adaptive for learning and may point to adolescence as a unique life phase for increased feedback-learning performance.</li>

•Arc protein exhibits similar biochemical properties as retroviral Gag proteins<br />
•Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs)<br />
•Arc EVs and capsids can mediate intercellular transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA in neurons</p>
<p>The neuronal gene <em>Arc</em> is essential for long-lasting information storage in the mammalian brain, mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about Arc’s molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA into new target cells, where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer <em>Arc</em> mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/<em>gypsy</em> retrotransposons, which are also ancestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system.</p>

<li>Climate change, predatory capitalism and religious fundamentalism really are only ‘surface’ phenomena, because the human actions leading to them are determined by the deep structure of our minds, the functional architecture of our culturally embedded brains. The real challenge is not climate change as such; the true problems humankind must confront are the inbuilt features of our very own minds, such as systematic rationality and empathy deficits, self-deception, and the extreme vulnerability of the inner mechanisms creating mental autonomy.</li>
<li>This process of learning about ourselves is emotionally unattractive to many. It forces us to confront centuries-old systems of systematic self-deception, often represented by certain forms of organised religion. Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of mental autonomy is our general inability to notice when we lack it. Not only does there seem to be a widespread form of ‘introspective neglect’ related to the losses of cognitive self-control characterising our inner life, resembling a form of anosognosia or anosodiaphoria (as in patients unable to become aware of, or who remain indifferent to, the existence of a disability, such as the fact that their left arm is paralysed). The phenomenon of mind-wandering itself is also clearly related to denial and confabulation. Introspective experience and the verbal reports of one’s own inner life are probably likely to be distorted by overconfidence bias regarding the degree to which one actually is in control, by illusions of superiority and introspection illusion (in which we falsely assume direct insight into the origins of our mental states, while treating others’ introspections as unreliable).</li>
<li>What is clear by now is that our societies lack systematic and institutionalised ways of enhancing citizens’ mental autonomy. This is a neglected duty of care on the part of governments. There can be no politically mature citizens without a sufficient degree of mental autonomy, but society as a whole does not act to protect or increase it. Yet, it might be the most precious resource of all. In the end, and in the face of serious existential risks posed by environmental degradation and advanced capitalism, we must understand that citizens’ collective level of mental autonomy will be the decisive factor.</li>
<li>It was William James, the father of American psychology, who said in 1892: ‘And the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. […] And education which should improve this faculty would be <em>the</em> education <em>par excellence</em>.’ We can finally see more clearly what meditation is really about: over the centuries, the main goal has always been a sustained enhancement of one’s mental autonomy.</li>

<li>for me it simulates immersion, in a focused way which concentrates on the topics I have a wish to remember and have chosen to learn, but which prompts and jogs memory at close to the time I was about to forget. in this way, eventually I build a memory for these particular topics which is easily recalled.</li>
<li>most people start off wanting to learn, until someone they trust tells them they shouldn't.</li>
<li>most of when we get lost is because of a lack of context. we learn best when we have that context</li>

<ul>
<li>what is learning? how do we come to appreciate something may be true when we previously believed it was not true or even did not know of the possibility that such a thing could even occur?
<ul>
<li>because they are stuck in the logic of their current position, they can’t yet learn to change their opinion on a topic. this is the crux of the issue and also of how we learn and change and grow.</li>
<li>is this the process which becomes more difficult as we become older? not the learning itself but the removal of the baggage, the conscious logical structures we have built up through long experience is more and more consuming the energy that could have gone into the process of acceptance?</li>
<li>this is the very same issue as Socrates is held to expose in the Apology: how to help others learn what they do not already know, when they may hold power over you, power that may be abusive and inimical?</li>
<li>currently, thinking is about conscious thinking in our society, not about thinking which cannot be described or transmitted in words. is it possible to improve that kind of thinking that we cannot describe? I believe it is not only possible but imperative to do so</li>

<h2>01331</h2>
<ul>
<li>how to approach learning in a open way. be aware that everything has advantages as well as disadvantages. allow yourself to absorb the information about it, while letting your inner experience be your guide rather than what people try to convince you is right. but for this to work you will need to question and change your inner experience often and regularly.</li>
<li>absorb and synthesise information, while remaining aware of cognitive bias (e.g. familiarity bias), to extract what is useful</li>
</ul>
<h2>01231</h2>
<ul>
<li>illusory knowledge, when you read something and it triggers recognition that you have read it before, gives illusion of being able to access and use that knowledge at will at another time as needed, when actually it is habituated reuse of that knowledge which would make that possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01131</h2>

<li>do all the experiments you need to before you sleep, so that your unconscious mind can play with the data and patterns freely.</li>

<ul>
<li>real learning is not about understanding some perfect structure or path but about the little fragments that stick and that we use in our reconstruction, that give hints towards progress and ledges from which we leap in our perception</li>
</ul>
<h2>00831</h2>
<ul>
<li>if time is our ultimate constraint then knowledge is one of the releases from it — knowledge does not always need to be gathered by each person on their own, it can be passed (partially) from person to person at a fraction of the cost of gathering it ourselves, and in the process builds conceptual frameworks we could not otherwise raise on our own</li>
</ul>
<h2>00731</h2>
<ul>
<li>is all learning perceptual — beyond our conscious comprehension — and only explainable retrospectively in words and concepts? in other words, are our ideas of learning all very far from reality?</li>
</ul>
<h2>00631</h2>
<ul>
<li>why is it important to try to learn better? when we do not, we are stuck with the beliefs and attitudes we already have. we interpret our life experiences with the beliefs we hold — if those beliefs are very far from reality, the lessons we learn from our experiences will be as far from reality</li>
</ul>
<h2>00531</h2>
<ul>
<li>our educations are about learning to think, but we also need to unlearn, to learn to unthink.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00431</h2>
<ul>
<li>when someone no longer wants to learn, or no longer has the ability to learn, then you can only reason with them based on their current knowledge, rather than on what they might be learning or the trends in their knowledge. this makes most reasoning fruitless because they do not wish to learn knowledge that would enable them to understand beyond what they already know, and can thus only act according to their set patterns rather than more appropriately or responsibly to reality</li>
<li>similarly if they follow restrictive belief structures and authorities then they will be limited to those courses of belief and action</li>
</ul>
<h2>00331</h2>
<ul>
<li>confirming and dissolving (popperian falsifiability) to discribe the two tendencies of science, is better and simpler to understand than confirmation and “falsifiability”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00231</h2>
<ul>
<li>it isn't that everyone needs to achieve mastery of something. it is that when we do achieve mastery of something, we learn many things along the way that help us in our journey. in learning the piano, mostly on my own in a room, I learned, among other things, to: focus; move rapidly and precisely in near–darkness; vary goals to create and maintain challenge and progress; let go conscious thought and let action flow; slow breathing; express delicate and raw emotion; persist; listen to bodily reaction to know when something was as intended; extrapolate from sparse data; act without needing words; find and apply pattern; aim for long–term and short–term effectiveness; deal with changing conditions and abilities over time…</li>
</ul>
<h2>00131</h2>
<ul>
<li>just as memory is really recreation of an event, malleable each time it is recalled, so too is learning — learning is a malleable process, it is a recreation of a process, which changes each time someone learns something from someone else or internally.</li>
<li>learning is taking in reality and adjusting own internal reality to match. we are all innately able to learn but often abusive habits get in the way. like not truly seeing reality, but instead only our interpretation of it — only what matches our expectations or worldview. major corrective ability is the ability to question our own reality — does it correspond well with reality or not? when this ability is obstructed, then our internal world slips further and further from reality. abusive people know to increase this obstruction.</li>
<li>ideas are the way they are because they haven’t gotten further yet, not because they are true. we do the best we can with what we have at this moment.</li>
</ul>
