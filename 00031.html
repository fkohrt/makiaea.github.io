<p><em>black box thinking: why most people never learn from their mistakes, but some do</em><br />
matthew syed 2015<br />
978-0-698-40887-6</p>
<ul>
<li>sadly this book often still misses the crucial point that what is omitted from the premisses may be critical to conclusions based on reality.</li>
<li>“Failure is thus a signpost. It reveals a feature of our world we hadn’t grasped fully and offers vital clues about how to update our models, strategies, and behaviors”</li>
<li>“They were only considering the planes that had returned. They were not taking into account the planes that had not returned (i.e., the planes that had been shot down). The observable bullet holes suggested that the area around the cockpit and tail didn’t need reinforcing because it was never hit. In fact, the planes that were hit in these places were crashing because this is where they were most vulnerable.”</li>
<li>sullenberger “Everything we know in aviation, every rule in the rule book, every procedure we have, we know because someone somewhere died . . . We have purchased at great cost, lessons literally bought with blood that we have to preserve as institutional knowledge and pass on to succeeding generations. We cannot have the moral failure of forgetting these lessons and have to relearn them.”</li>
<li>This also reveals a subtle asymmetry between confirmation and falsification, between success and failure. If you are careful enough to limit your observations to low altitudes and open containers, you could find countless instances where water does indeed boil at 100ºC. But none of this successful “evidence” would have expanded our knowledge very much. Indeed, in one sense, it would not have even increased the probability of the assertion “water always boils at 100ºC.”</li>
<li>This point was originally made by the Scottish philosopher David Hume in the eighteenth century, and popularized recently by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the mathematician and author. Taleb has pointed out that you could observe a million white swans, but this would not prove the proposition: all swans are white. The observation of a single black swan, on the other hand, would conclusively demonstrate its falsehood.</li>
<li>Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow:</li>
<li>“Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative.”</li>
<li>David Bayles and Ted Orland, Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking (New York: Image Continuum Press, 2001).</li>
<li>“In their book Art and Fear David Bayles and Ted Orland tell the story of a ceramics teacher who announced on the opening day of class that he was dividing the students into two groups. Half were told that they would be graded on quantity. On the final day of term, the teacher said he would come to class with some scales and weigh the pots they had made. They would get an “A” for 50 lbs of pots, a “B” for 40 lbs, and so on. The other half would be graded on quality. They just had to bring along their one, perfect pot.</li>
<li>The results were emphatic: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group graded for quantity. As Bayles and Orland put it: “It seems that while the ‘quantity’ group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the ‘quality’ group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”</li>
<li>As the philosopher Karl Popper put it: “True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it.”</li>

<li>Our review of the learning-styles literature led us to define a particular type of evidence that we see as a minimum precondition for validating the use of a learning-style assessment in an instructional setting. As described earlier, we have been unable to find any evidence that clearly meets this standard. Moreover, several studies that used the appropriate type of research design found results that contradict the most widely held version of the learning-styles hypothesis, namely, what we have referred to as the meshing hypothesis (Constantinidou &amp; Baker, 2002; Massa &amp; Mayer, 2006). The contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning-styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is, in our opinion, striking and disturbing. If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility, it remains to be demonstrated.</li>

<p><em>dispelling the myth: training in education or neuroscience decreases but does not eliminate beliefs in neuromyths</em><br />

<li>Thus, the integration of multiple modalities can be beneficial for learning and this practice is conflated with the learning styles neuromyth. In other words, this particular neuromyth presents a challenge to the education field because it seems to be supporting effective instructional practice, but for the wrong reasons. To dispel this particular myth might inadvertently discourage diversity in instructional approaches if it is not paired with explicit discussion of the distinctions between learning styles theory and multimodal instruction.</li>
<li>Another limitation of the true/false paradigm is that we cannot discern participants' certainty of their answers because we did not include an “I don't know” answer choice.</li>
<li>Neuromyths are misconceptions about brain research and its application to education and learning. Previous research has shown that these myths may be quite pervasive among educators, but less is known about how these rates compare to the general public or to individuals who have more exposure to neuroscience. This study is the first to use a large sample from the United States to compare the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among educators, the general public, and individuals with high neuroscience exposure. Neuromyth survey responses and demographics were gathered via an online survey hosted at TestMyBrain.org. We compared performance among the three groups of interest: educators (<em>N</em> = 598), high neuroscience exposure (<em>N</em> = 234), and the general public (<em>N</em> = 3,045) and analyzed predictors of individual differences in neuromyths performance. In an exploratory factor analysis, we found that a core group of 7 “classic” neuromyths factored together (items related to learning styles, dyslexia, the Mozart effect, the impact of sugar on attention, right-brain/left-brain learners, and using 10% of the brain). The general public endorsed the greatest number of neuromyths (<em>M</em> = 68%), with significantly fewer endorsed by educators (<em>M</em> = 56%), and still fewer endorsed by the high neuroscience exposure group (<em>M</em> = 46%). The two most commonly endorsed neuromyths across all groups were related to learning styles and dyslexia. More accurate performance on neuromyths was predicted by age (being younger), education (having a graduate degree), exposure to neuroscience courses, and exposure to peer-reviewed science. These findings suggest that training in education and neuroscience can help reduce but does not eliminate belief in neuromyths. We discuss the possible underlying roots of the most prevalent neuromyths and implications for classroom practice. These empirical results can be useful for developing comprehensive training modules for educators that target general misconceptions about the brain and learning.</li>

<p><em>n-back versus complex span working memory training</em><br />
kara j. blacker et al. 2017<br />

<ul>
<li>Working memory (WM) is the ability to maintain and manipulate task-relevant information in the absence of sensory input. While its improvement through training is of great interest, the degree to which WM training transfers to untrained WM tasks (near transfer) and other untrained cognitive skills (far transfer) remains debated and the mechanism(s) underlying transfer are unclear. Here we hypothesized that a critical feature of dual n-back training is its reliance on maintaining relational information in WM. In experiment 1, using an individual differences approach, we found evidence that performance on an n-back task was predicted by performance on a measure of relational WM (i.e., WM for vertical spatial relationships independent of absolute spatial locations), whereas the same was not true for a complex span WM task. In experiment 2, we tested the idea that reliance on relational WM is critical to produce transfer from n-back but not complex span task training. Participants completed adaptive training on either a dual n-back task, a symmetry span task, or on a non-WM active control task. We found evidence of near transfer for the dual n-back group; however, far transfer to a measure of fluid intelligence did not emerge. Recording EEG during a separate WM transfer task, we examined group-specific, training-related changes in alpha power, which are proposed to be sensitive to WM demands and top-down modulation of WM. Results indicated that the dual n-back group showed significantly greater frontal alpha power after training compared to before training, more so than both other groups. However, we found no evidence of improvement on measures of relational WM for the dual n-back group, suggesting that near transfer may not be dependent on relational WM. These results suggest that dual n-back and complex span task training may differ in their effectiveness to elicit near transfer as well as in the underlying neural changes they facilitate.</li>

<p><em>complex span and n-back measures of working memory: a meta-analysis</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Working memory is a construct of primary relevance to many areas of psychology. Two types of tasks have been used to measure working memory, primarily in different research areas: Complex span tasks are commonly used in behavioral studies in the cognitive and individual-differences literature, whereas <em>n</em>-back tasks have been used more frequently in cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neural underpinnings of working memory. Despite both categories of tasks being labeled as “working memory” measures, previous empirical studies have provided mixed evidence regarding the shared amount of overlapping processes between complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present meta-analysis showed that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are weakly correlated, although significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. A follow-up analysis of unpublished data indicated that the sample composition affects the relationship between the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks, following the law of diminishing returns. Finally, a separate meta-analysis indicated that the simple span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are correlated to the same extent as are the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present findings indicate that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks cannot be used interchangeably as working memory measures in research applications.</li>

<li>Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control.</li>

<li>it depends on where you apply the effort. if you apply the effort once you have neared mastery of the initial skill, then the effort applied will likely gain you a better return on the new skill than on the old. in any case your brain will likely be unable not to reinforce the old skill while you are learning the new.

<p>ego depletion is nothing of the sort. besides evidence that non glucose stimulation at the point of “depletion” can revive the subject, it may not even be the question of glucose depletion versus mental depletion.</p>
<p>it may instead be the difference between our habits and changing them. when we spend time doing strange new things or actively changing habits, tendency towards the mean or tendency towards equilibrium would suggest that the next action would be a habitual one rather than another change of habit. so it may be that the key to increase level of performance is to accumulate better general habits and review and maintain them.</p>

<li>trust in your ability to learn. when using an srs (spaced repetition system), do not beat yourself up if you do not remember something perfectly, it will come with time and exposure, when we continue with practice. like all tools, if we use it in one of the ways in which it works well, we can get good results.</li>
<li>for me it simulates immersion, in a focused way which concentrates on the topics I have a wish to remember and have chosen to learn, but which prompts and jogs memory at close to the time I was about to forget. in this way, eventually I build a memory for these particular topics which is easily recalled.</li>
