<p><em>tolerance to ambiguous uncertainty predicts prosocial behavior</em><br />
marc-lluís vives, oriel feldmanhall 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04631-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04631-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual’s ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another’s actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one’s willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.</li>

<p><em>information avoidance</em><br />

<ul>
<li>We commonly think of information as a means to an end. However, a growing theoretical and experimental literature suggests that information may directly enter the agent's utility function. This can create an incentive to avoid information, even when it is useful, free, and independent of strategic considerations. We review research documenting the occurrence of information avoidance, as well as theoretical and empirical research on reasons why people avoid information, drawing from economics, psychology, and other disciplines. The review concludes with a discussion of some of the diverse (and often costly) individual and societal consequences of information avoidance.</li>

<p><em>hypocognition: making sense of the world beyond one’s conceptual reach</em><br />
wu, k., &amp; dunning, d 2018<br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>Does Action Require Meaning?<br />
But our discussion of hypocognition leads to a rather pointed question: To act, do people necessarily need meaning? As our Fijian example about pregnant women and toxic fish suggests, significant actions at times may require no explicit meaning or rationale for people to guide people to execute them (Henrich &amp; Henrich, 2010). Our discussion of Gettier cases suggests, too, that actions may follow from spurious or mistaken understandings of circumstances that just happen to lead to adaptive behavior.<br />
After all, across human history, people have lived their lives just fine without the aid of concepts we enjoy in our modern life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319974334_hypocognition_making_sense_of_the_landscape_beyond_one%27s_conceptual_reach">pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> People think, feel, and behave within the confines of what they can conceive. Outside that conceptual landscape, people exhibit hypocognition (i.e., lacking cognitive or linguistic representations of concepts to describe ideas or explicate experiences). We review research on the implications of hypocognition for cognition and behavior. Drawing on the expertise and cross-cultural literatures, we describe how hypocognition impoverishes one’s mental world, leaving cognitive deficits in recognition, explanation, and memory while fueling social chauvinism and conflict in political and cultural spheres. Despite its pervasive consequences, people cannot be expected to identify when they are in a hypocognitive state, mistaking what they conceive for the totality of all that there is. To the extent that their channel of knowledge becomes too narrow, people risk submitting to hypocognition’s counterpart, hypercognition (i.e., the mistaken overapplication of other available conceptual notions to issues outside their actual relevance).</p>

<li>unknowing the future
<ul>
<li>it might sound at first to be a contradiction, but to prepare for the future we must first know and understand that we cannot predict the future.</li>
<li>people often believe that they understand the world and what goes on in it. in reality it is the people who realise that they understand the world very little who are best prepared for the reality of an unpredictable world.</li>
<li>unfortunately a lot of people's feelings of security and safety and self worth are bound up with their beliefs. why should they thank you for showing them they are not as safe as they believe themselves to be?</li>
<li>if you are this type of person, then i very strongly suggest you stop reading this book now. although you stand to benefit enormously from what we describe here, the fact that you go into this unprepared means you are much less likely to survive.</li>
<li>i don't need to invoke the black swans of taleb or the two systems of kahneman to tell you the world is not as we often think it is.</li>
<li>you might want to explore their theories first, as a more gentle introduction to the subject.</li>
<li>we'll be moving very quickly, for example i will say that i don't believe in evil, but that there are many people who are misguided in their relation to reality, and this means that they can be very dangerous to you. this might seem to both contradict the first part of the sentence and perhaps even to seem to provide a good reason not to believe that first part.</li>

<li>why search engines are less useful: learning what we don't know we want to know. advocating human links — why we still need mentors.</li>

<li>we speak of the things which we can and cannot sense, that which we might not yet comprehend or not yet believe. it is a journey, a story, a spell</li>

<li>just because we can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. just because we don't yet understand something doesn't mean it isn't true. just because we don't yet believe something doesn't mean we never will.
<ul>
<li>It is a mistake to believe that just because we don't see or understand something, that it does not exist or has no validity. Even if we don't see or understand something, it can still effect us.<br />
Unfortunately this is the mindset of dictators and abusers regarding climate change, and the possibility of biological or nuclear disaster.</li>

<li>the future will come, no matter what we do. so it is not ours to give to anybody. but, in a way, it is, because we give the gift of a possible future. in choosing how we give each day, how we live and build the present day, we make some futures more possible.</li>
<li>why does it surprise me when people assume something when they have insufficient information to draw that conclusion?
<ul>
<li>for example, when someone assumes that I cannot do something, when all the evidence they have is that I have not done that thing so far</li>
<li>or when someone does not try to look beyond their initial impression of somebody or something</li>
<li>is this narrowing of their potential world a protective mechanism, an adaptive response to past trauma? simply what they have been asked to believe in? a misunderstanding of the possibilities of reality?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strongly suspect this is the same mechanism that allows people who behave abusively (all of us, some of the time) to believe that we behave responsibly all the time</li>

<li>we might think that all it takes to learn something is the right words, the right concepts, but reality is very different from that. we see and hear the words, we perceive the concepts, only in a partial fashion. it is what we do with the partial understanding that is magical — we transform it in a real, imperfectly practical process that becomes the fabric of our lives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00297</h2>
<ul>
<li>the reality is that most people cannot hear what you are saying, even when they want to. this is not because of some failing, but because the processes of communication, recall, thinking and doing are all patchy, they rely on many factors which are often not available. but that doesn't mean we stop trying, it just means we must make do with what we have. there is need for better processes, but at root we recreate the reality that we make from incomplete means, even though we often do not understand that we do so.</li>

<h2>00197</h2>
<ul>
<li>human knowledge is essentially wrong. this is not because of some great fraudulent conspiracy, but because it is the nature of knowledge to be incomplete. a map can never be the territory, that is not its nature.</li>
<li>from the daoist way that cannot be expressed to the socratic admonition to question what we think we know, to the buddhist world of illusory belief, to the stoic bounded locus of control, to genesis' forbidden tree; theories that show the limits of our abilities, in the service of living practical lives understanding that what we do understand is not all there is to the world.</li>
