<h1><em>young children see a single action and infer a social norm: promiscuous normativity in 3-year-olds</em></h1>
<p>marco f. h. schmidt, lucas p. butler, julia heinz, and michael tomasello 2016<br />

<h2>Human social life depends heavily on social norms that prescribe and proscribe specific actions. Typically, young children learn social norms from adult instruction. In the work reported here, we showed that this is not the whole story: Three-year-old children are promiscuous normativists. In other words, they spontaneously inferred the presence of social norms even when an adult had done nothing to indicate such a norm in either language or behavior. And children of this age even went so far as to enforce these self-inferred norms when third parties “broke” them. These results suggest that children do not just passively acquire social norms from adult behavior and instruction; rather, they have a natural and proactive tendency to go from “is” to “ought.” That is, children go from observed actions to prescribed actions and do not perceive them simply as guidelines for their own behavior but rather as objective normative rules applying to everyone equally.</h2>
<h1><em>the racialized construction of exceptionality: experimental evidence of race/ethnicity effects on teachers' interventions</em></h1>

<h2>Scholars, policy-makers, and practitioners have long argued that students of color are over-represented in special education and under-represented in gifted education, arguing that educators make racially/ethnically biased decisions to refer and qualify students with disabilities and giftedness. Recent research has called this into question, focusing on the role of confounders of race/ethnicity. However, the role of educator decisions in the disproportionality is still unclear. In this study, I examine the role of student race/ethnicity in teachers' categorization of student needs as “exceptional” and in need of special or gifted education services. I use an original survey experiment in which teachers read case studies of fictional male students in which the race/ethnicity, English Language Learner status, and exceptionality characteristics were experimentally manipulated. The teachers are then asked whether they would refer the student for exceptionality testing. My findings suggest a complex intersection of race/ethnicity and exceptionality, in which white boys are more likely to be suspected of having exceptionalities when they exhibit academic challenges, while boys of color are more likely to be suspected when they exhibit behavioral challenges. This suggests that the racialized construction of exceptionalities reflects differential academic expectations and interpretations of behavior by race/ethnicity, with implications for the subjectivity of exceptionality identification and for the exacerbation of racial/ethnic inequalities in education.</h2>

<h1>Instinct</h1>
<h2>I have a strange premonition that something is going to happen soon in the world, and we won't be able to contact each other. I want you to know I will be thinking of you. here are my notes so far, I don't know if they'll be any help…</h2>
<h2>when I was young, I felt intuitively that something was awfully wrong with our society. after another twenty years I understood how to communicate this in language</h2>
<h2>trust your instincts. if they tell you to be wary, that's okay.</h2>
<h2>Instinct is a name given to processes we do not yet understand. Perception may be a better name for it. We can perceive and act on a situation even if we don't understand how to explain it in words.</h2>
<h2>Test your perception and then trust it. A way to approach this is to try to understand the physical filters on your perception, and your mental filters such as bias and judgement. Then we can understand some of the obstacles in the way of our perception and can trust our own perception.</h2>
<h2>people minimise what they don't understand. most want conscious explanation of hunches, feelings, premonitions before they can actually be articulated by our conscious brains, that is the very definition of premonition. they devalue this because they don't understand it and don't trust that we can understand something is useful when they can't. they demand that we trust them but they need to uphold the corresponding reponsibility. at the moment they don't so it is why we don't like it even though we could not find the words to express it before</h2>

<h1><em>social class and the motivational relevance of other human beings: evidence from visual attention</em></h1>

<h2>We theorize that people’s social class affects their appraisals of others’ motivational relevance—the degree to which others are seen as potentially rewarding, threatening, or otherwise worth attending to. Supporting this account, three studies indicate that social classes differ in the amount of attention their members direct toward other human beings. In Study 1, wearable technology was used to film the visual fields of pedestrians on city streets; higher-class participants looked less at other people than did lower-class participants. In Studies 2a and 2b, participants’ eye movements were tracked while they viewed street scenes; higher class was associated with reduced attention to people in the images. In Study 3, a change-detection procedure assessed the degree to which human faces spontaneously attract visual attention; faces proved less effective at drawing the attention of high-class than low-class participants, which implies that class affects spontaneous relevance appraisals. The measurement and conceptualization of social class are discussed.</h2>

<h2><em>Significance</em></h2>
<p>We created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants’ voices while they talked toward happiness, sadness, or fear. Independent listeners perceived the transformations as natural examples of emotional speech, but the participants remained unaware of the manipulation, indicating that we are not continuously monitoring our own emotional signals. Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed. This result is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback on emotional experience in the auditory domain. This finding is of great significance, because the mechanisms behind the production of vocal emotion are virtually unknown.</p>
<h2><em>Abstract</em></h2>
<p>Research has shown that people often exert control over their emotions. By modulating expressions, reappraising feelings, and redirecting attention, they can regulate their emotional experience. These findings have contributed to a blurring of the traditional boundaries between cognitive and emotional processes, and it has been suggested that emotional signals are produced in a goal-directed way and monitored for errors like other intentional actions. However, this interesting possibility has never been experimentally tested. To this end, we created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants’ voices while they talked in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear. The result showed that the audio transformations were being perceived as natural examples of the intended emotions, but the great majority of the participants, nevertheless, remained unaware that their own voices were being manipulated. This finding indicates that people are not continuously monitoring their own voice to make sure that it meets a predetermined emotional target. Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed, which was measured by both self-report and skin conductance level. This change is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback effects on emotional experience in the auditory domain. As such, our result reinforces the wider framework of self-perception theory: that we often use the same inferential strategies to understand ourselves as those that we use to understand others.</p>

<h1>dyslexia</h1>
<h2>dyslexic in dream: I could read the numbers but couldn't quite make out the letters; apparently this is what happens in dyslexia. could it be that in dreams I am dyslexic? apparently not all people are dyslexic in their dreams, at least not all the time. so could it be that when a certain part of the brain is resting in sleep, it resembles dyslexia?</h2>
<h2>could it be that dream states are because certain parts of the brain are resting and we may be able to correlate different types of dream states with different parts of the brain resting?</h2>
<h2>maybe dyslexics have a certain kind of synaesthesia which mixes letters with colours and movement. when colorised filters applied, the colour no longer salient so movement also suppressed. the type of coloured filter required to block the so-called dyslexia varies with the kind of so-called synaesthesia.</h2>
