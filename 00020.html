<h1>recognising abusive behaviour</h1>
<h2>as long as things are done responsibly I don't mind how they are done, so whether things happen one way or another I don't really have an opinion on normally. but when people are irresponsible, watch out!</h2>
<h2>they try to teach us to isolate ourselves, so that we become easier for them to manipulate — when we are encouraged to turn away from someone just because they do not share all our current opinions, we end up turning away everybody. this is how they at once unite and divide us — united in our loneliness and fear and striking at the enemies our abusers choose for us, and divided to stop us opposing their abuse</h2>
<ul>
<li>an answer is to grow our society, one which rejects abuse so they can no longer take power from us. each and every person can relearn that these chains do not bind us. we awaken from this nightmare of abuse to a new dawn — the dawn of a great civilisation</li>
</ul>
<h2>there is only a very small difference between abusive and responsible behaviour — some people do not want to face the reality that they also sometimes behave abusively, but that does not mean reality does not exist</h2>
<h2>human rights don't exist, that is precisely the point. they are an attempt to describe what we as a society should afford to people, whether they are part of our society or not. and if we do not do so, we can expect people to understand we are abusing them, and they will act accordingly.</h2>
<ul>
<li>human rights are not about entitlements, they are what people need to live dignified lives within society</li>
</ul>
<h2>the people who use the attackers to kill and rape, and the people who use the attackers to sow fear and hatred — they are all abusers.</h2>
<h2>“less than a dollar a day, no need to worry about environment” is argument proposed by abusive people. it is people who have least buffer who are most vulnerable, and what the abuser wants is to pair “less” with the feeling of desperation.</h2>
<h2>in a world full of abuse, some say it is “priviledged” to speak of some smaller abuse that they perpetuate. but that too is an abusive argument — they want us to feel their abuse is less than worst, that it is not abuse.</h2>
<h2>it is not “idealism” that is counter to this, but understanding that whatever form abuse takes, we must counter it. if someone cries “idealism”, they parrot the arguments of abusive people without thinking, or are abusive themselves.</h2>
<h2>as we all hold some beliefs that we have not examined, so we are all that part abusive. this is no idealism, no dream — it is why we all must do our bit, and those who intentionally do not do their bit are abusers.</h2>
<h2>the difference between intentional abusers and everybody else is: they want to perpetuate abuse, rather than want love to replace abuse.</h2>
<h2>what is love? in the simplest words, that is what it is — wishing better for all, rather than worse.</h2>
<h2>to live lovingly, we must confront abuse of others and within ourselves. let us speak today of some ways to live lovingly.</h2>
<h2>My talent has always been to see the reality, beyond people’s words or intentions.</h2>
<ul>
<li>it is possible that the reason I so strongly dislike people who are lying is that this is one of the forms of abuse that I had to deal with. but the upside is that this trained me to go beyond what I was told was true.</li>
</ul>
<h2>i intensely dislike it when people lie. when people lie, it makes life much more difficult, for themselves and others</h2>
<ul>
<li>but how do people get in the habit of lying?</li>
<li>mostly it is because people are trained to do it by other people.</li>
<li>at first they might do it because they believe it will gain them some advantage, but eventually it just becomes a habit, a spell which, in the societies of the early twenty-first century, is rarely broken.</li>
<li>no, this is the truth. the rich politicians and businessmen accrete power which is not theirs to have. they have done so overwhelmingly by lying, to themselves and to others about what their real objectives are. those objectives were originaly to gain power, but have now simply become an addictive, abusive habit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>abusive people seek</h2>
<ul>
<li>control of our beliefs</li>
<li>control of our resources</li>
</ul>
<h2>suggestibility, mesmerisability, hypnosis, these work by bypassing our conscious filters and suggestions entering our subconscious brains more directly. these are signs that abusive people look for in their potential victims. suggestions most likely constantly enter subconsciously — it is just that under these conditions they are particularly effective and thus potentially more dangerous.</h2>
<ul>
<li>so a young teenager reading deep into the night, a sleep deprived new–parent, people trapped by their environment in centrally heated homes, older people with sleep apnea, soldiers and civilians at war, all are likely to experience strange dreams and are particularly susceptible to what can influence them — be it televised or immediate violence, simulated reality in fiction, or political and abusive demagogues.</li>
<li>when we are chronically sleep deprived, such as when we have central–heating–dehydration–induced sleep apnea, or when we regularly sleep on a full stomach without being able to regulate our temperature (for example thick duvet, random heat jumps through central heating switching on and off from thermostat), that is when we can be particularly suggestible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>purity, sanctity, perfection, eternity, disgust, hatred, fear, evil, immutability: these are all things abusers wish us to believe in so they can take our power.</h2>
<ul>
<li>to make us believe in evil is necessary concept if the abusers want us to believe we are powerless, that they are the only saviours who can rescue us, that we must trust and believe in them.</li>
<li>abusers created the concept of evil. people's belief in evil helps abusers control and manipulate them, to make them slaves and pawns in wars against other abusers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>one of the first things an abuser will try to make you believe is that there is no escape, that there is no alternative to submitting to their abuse. often they will even believe this is true — if they were abused in the past, their abusers may have trained them to believe it.</h2>
<h2>people who are abusive in one major way are very likely to be abusive in other major ways. this is because the source of their abusive behaviour is similar. a person who desires power is likely to be sexist and racist — because to allow themselves to be abusive and take power from others, they value others much less than themselves.</h2>
<h2>shows how people cheat and lie for power: how to lie with statistics by darrell huff, thank you for arguing by jay heinrichs, the prince by machiavelli</h2>
<h2>interactions set expectations</h2>
<ul>
<li>expectations set by interactions with others – like the seeding done by exposure to random number influences numerical estimates, so also do the conditions under which we live and work alters our expectations and thinking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>no answer to illogical questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>we have no right to an answer to illogical questions. for example, if we ask why we should bother when others are not making the effort, we are already barking up the wrong tree.</li>
</ul>
<h2>question of “if gandhi was so great, why were his family not also?” leave aside truth of whether statement about gandhi or family is true, what is speaker saying? he says “if X is good, why is Y, which is associated with X, not also good?”</h2>
<ul>
<li>a similar type of question is “if X can do Z, and Z is good, why does X not do so?”</li>
</ul>
<h2>where is there a big tasty morsel jumping all over the street?</h2>
<ul>
<li>or: like there's gonna be a big tasty treat prancing all over the place.</li>
</ul>
<h2>what abusive people do is set people up for failure</h2>
<h2>some people will destroy the value of something great in order to gain a small value for themselves</h2>
<ul>
<li>jack tyres metaphor</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>leading with weaknesses</em></h2>
<p>under conditions of skeptical reception, more effective to adopt powerless communication by accentuating the flaws in your idea</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>disarms audience</em><br />
‘here’s why you shouldn’t buy this company,’ first response laughter, they physically relax. it’s sincere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>show intelligence</em><br />
when show problems, demonstrate are not snowed by own ideas or trying to snow them; shrewd judge of own shortcomings. smart enough to do homework and anticipate some problems they would spot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>show trustworthy</em><br />
not only knowledgeable, but also honest and modest. speaking frankly of weaknesses then more credible when talking about strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ease of retrieval bias</em><br />
leaves audiences with a more favorable assessment. by acknowledging most serious problems, make it harder for others to generate their own ideas about what is wrong. as they find themselves thinking hard to identify other concerns, they decide problems aren’t actually that severe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A key question to ask yourself when evaluating someone's message or actions is:</h2>
<p>“Are they doing this for the good of the world, or are they doing it to maintain someone’s power over others?”<br />
Often abusive people will try to cloak their abusive actions by appealing to what people want or have been led to want and believe. You will be able to easily evaluate whether their actions actually match what they say, or whether they intend to deceive you.</p>
<h2>Black–and–white opinions are a coping strategy for people’s fears.</h2>
<h2>ignorance as enemy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ignorance as the only true enemy. All other enemies are created in order to manipulate people although this makes them real in a sense, they are created and maintained by abusive people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>leaks exist, horrible abuse is revealed, not only because of courageous whistleblowers but because the horrible abuse exists — if it did not exist it could not be exposed</h2>
<h2>giving someone what they want to hear, in exchange for their cooperation on an immediate issue — seems reasonable until you realise this behaviour just sets people up for future failure — it supports false reality and makes the transition to reality harder and more destructive</h2>
<h2>when we are too sensitive to abusive people's behaviour, it may seem comforting to spend time alone, away from their abuse.</h2>
<h2>the odd thing is that abusive people tend to gravitate towards positions in society where they can indulge their abusive behaviour. a responsible person, since they can do many things, is not tied to one path.</h2>

<h2>when the nights grow cold</h2>
<p>and the cards all fold<br />
and the saints we see<br />
are all made of gold</p>
<p>when your dreams all fail<br />
and the ones we hail<br />
are the worst of all<br />
and the blood’s run stale</p>
<p>there is no higher truth<br />
there is no shelter you<br />
can find from the beast inside<br />
there’s no place we can hide</p>
<p>☆it matters what we feed<br />
　(we’ve got to stop the seed)<br />
　this beast we made from need<br />
　(this beast of endless need)<br />
　this is our kingdom come<br />
　this is our kingdom come</p>
<p>★when you feel the heat<br />
　look into your eyes<br />
　to where our demons hide<br />
　where our demons hide<br />
　don’t get too close<br />
　it’s dark inside<br />
　where our demons hide<br />
　where our demons hide</p>
<p>at the curtain’s call<br />
it’s the last of all<br />
when the lights fade out<br />
all the sinners crawl</p>
<p>so they dug your grave<br />
and the masquerade<br />
will come calling out<br />
at the mess you made</p>
<p>don’t want to let you down<br />
but i am / hell bound<br />
though this is all for you<br />
don’t wanna hide the truth</p>
<p>☆,★ repeat</p>
<p>some said it’s up to fate<br />
we say it’s what we make<br />
it’s woven in our souls<br />
we need to let you go</p>
<p>your eyes, they shine so bright<br />
i want to heed that light<br />
we can escape this now<br />
now that you show me how</p>
