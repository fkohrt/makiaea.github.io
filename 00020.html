<ul>
<li>an answer is to grow our society, one which rejects abuse so they can no longer take power from us. each and every person can relearn that these chains do not bind us. we awaken from this nightmare of abuse to a new dawn — the dawn of a great civilisation</li>
<li>it is not “idealism” that is counter to abuse, but understanding that whatever form abuse takes, we must counter it. if someone cries “idealism”, they parrot the arguments of abusive people without thinking, or are abusive themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>05120</h2>
<ul>
<li>the odd thing is that abusive people tend to gravitate towards positions in society where they can indulge their abusive behaviour. a responsible person, since they can do many things, is not tied to one path.</li>

<li>the world today resembles an awful dysfunctional family: an abusive authoritarian parent, and an abusive manipulative parent. even then, if we unfortunate enough to lose one or even both of them, we are worse off.</li>

<li>A key question to ask yourself when evaluating someone's message or actions is:<br />
“Are they doing this for the good of the world, or are they doing it to maintain someone’s power over others?”<br />
Often abusive people will try to cloak their abusive actions by appealing to what people want or have been led to want and believe. You will be able to easily evaluate whether their actions actually match what they say, or whether they intend to deceive you.</li>

<li>suggestibility, mesmerisability, hypnosis, these work by bypassing our conscious filters and suggestions entering our subconscious brains more directly. these are signs that abusive people look for in their potential victims. suggestions most likely constantly enter subconsciously — it is just that under these conditions they are particularly effective and thus potentially more dangerous.

<li>so a young teenager reading deep into the night, a sleep deprived new–parent, people trapped by their environment in centrally heated homes, older people with sleep apnea, soldiers and civilians at war, all are likely to experience strange dreams and are particularly susceptible to what can influence them — be it televised or immediate violence, simulated reality in fiction, or political and abusive demagogues.</li>
<li>when we are chronically sleep deprived, such as when we have central–heating–dehydration–induced sleep apnea, or when we regularly sleep on a full stomach without being able to regulate our temperature (for example thick duvet, random heat jumps through central heating switching on and off from thermostat), that is when we can be particularly suggestible.</li>

<li>i intensely dislike it when people lie. when people lie, it makes life much more difficult, for themselves and others
<ul>
<li>but how do people get in the habit of lying?</li>
<li>mostly it is because people are trained to do it by other people.</li>
<li>at first they might do it because they believe it will gain them some advantage, but eventually it just becomes a habit, a spell which, in the societies of the early twenty-first century, is rarely broken.</li>
<li>no, this is the truth. the rich politicians and businessmen accrete power which is not theirs to have. they have done so overwhelmingly by lying, to themselves and to others about what their real objectives are. those objectives were originaly to gain power, but have now simply become an addictive, abusive habit.</li>

<li>Ignorance as the only true enemy. All other enemies are created in order to manipulate people although this makes them real in a sense, they are created and maintained by abusive people.</li>

<h2>01620</h2>
<h2>01520</h2>
<ul>
<li>people who are abusive in one major way are very likely to be abusive in other major ways. this is because the source of their abusive behaviour is similar. a person who desires power is likely to be sexist and racist — because to allow themselves to be abusive and take power from others, they value others much less than themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01420</h2>
<ul>
<li>one of the first things an abuser will try to make you believe is that there is no escape, that there is no alternative to submitting to their abuse. often they will even believe this is true — if they were abused in the past, their abusers may have trained them to believe it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01320</h2>
<ul>
<li>the people who use the attackers to kill and rape, and the people who use the attackers to sow fear and hatred — they are all abusers.</li>

<h2>01220</h2>
<ul>
<li>imagine you are reading this a thousand years in the future. who are they teaching you to hate? who do they accuse of abuse? what do they try to hide from you, and why? is the locked door they say is to keep you safe, in fact a prison to keep you contained?</li>
</ul>
<h2>01120</h2>
<ul>
<li>diversion
<ul>
<li>“less than a dollar a day, no need to worry about environment” is argument proposed by abusive people. it is people who have least buffer who are most vulnerable, and what the abuser wants is to pair “less” with the feeling of desperation.</li>
<li>in a world full of abuse, some say it is “priviledged” to speak of some smaller abuse that they perpetuate. but that too is an abusive argument — they want us to feel their abuse is less than worst, that it is not abuse.</li>
<li>question of “if gandhi was so great, why were his family not also?” leave aside truth of whether statement about gandhi or family is true, what is speaker saying? he says “if X is good, why is Y, which is associated with X, not also good?”

<li>divide and conquer
<ul>
<li>they try to teach us to isolate ourselves, so that we become easier for them to manipulate — when we are encouraged to turn away from someone just because they do not share all our current opinions, we end up turning away everybody. this is how they at once unite and divide us — united in our loneliness and fear and striking at the enemies our abusers choose for us, and divided to stop us opposing their abuse</li>

<h2>00820</h2>
<ul>
<li>purity, sanctity, perfection, eternity, disgust, hatred, fear, evil, immutability: these are all things abusers wish us to believe in so they can take our power.
<ul>
<li>to make us believe in evil is necessary concept if the abusers want us to believe we are powerless, that they are the only saviours who can rescue us, that we must trust and believe in them.</li>
<li>abusers created the concept of evil. people's belief in evil helps abusers control and manipulate them, to make them slaves and pawns in wars against other abusers.</li>

<h2>00720</h2>
<ul>
<li>to live lovingly, we must confront abuse of others and within ourselves. let us speak today of some ways to live lovingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00620</h2>
<ul>
<li>what is love? in the simplest words, that is what it is — wishing better for all, rather than worse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00520</h2>
<ul>
<li>the difference between intentional abusers and everybody else is: they want to perpetuate abuse, rather than want love to replace abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00420</h2>
<ul>
<li>human rights don't exist, that is precisely the point. they are an attempt to describe what we as a society should afford to people, whether they are part of our society or not. and if we do not do so, we can expect people to understand we are abusing them, and they will act accordingly.
<ul>
<li>human rights are not about entitlements, they are what people need to live dignified lives within society</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00320</h2>
<ul>
<li>there is only a very small difference between abusive and responsible behaviour — some people do not want to face the reality that they also sometimes behave abusively, but that does not mean reality does not exist</li>
</ul>
<h2>00220</h2>
<ul>
<li>as we all hold some beliefs that we have not examined, so we are all that part abusive. this is no idealism, no dream — it is why we all must do our bit, and those who intentionally do not do their bit are abusers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00120</h2>
<ul>
<li>whether abuse of resources, influence or omission — the abuse must stop</li>
<li>this is how you can spot abusers, because their influence is in one direction only, to perpetuate myths and lies that force people into false certainty, rather than to cherish diversity and the living, changing, reality of life.</li>
<li>why can it difficult to deal with abusive people? unfortunately they have different understanding of what is reasonable; by definition they are acting selfishly when we would expect them to be more considerate. unless we know they have a history of being abusive, we might not trust our judgement that they are abusive — in effect we are treating them as we would like to be treated, as a normal person who may just have some problems. unfortunately when we deal with an abusive person, they are unlike a normal person and treating them with consideration does not produce a good result. they will take advantage of your kindness, not because they are evil but because they they don't know how to behave better. so to preserve our sanity we need to communicate with them in a way they will understand. there may not be an easy way to do this as each person who acts abusively is abusive in their own way and to communicate you will need to understand their version of reality. one way is to say, &quot;that was mean,&quot; after they do something mean.
<ul>
<li>with responsible people this is much easier, because responsible people bring their own resources and act to understand your version of reality too; they are team players who play their part in a two–way communication. with an abusive person, the effort is only one way.</li>
<li>how do we determine if a person is abusive or not? you can see if they are abusive by their actions. everything they do will point towards their version of reality, and show how it may be distorted.</li>
