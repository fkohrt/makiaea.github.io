<p>learn in larger chunks: advantage to learning a new language before you can read<br />
<em>literate and preliterate children show different learning patterns in an artificial language learning task</em><br />
naomi havron et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41809-018-0015-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41809-018-0015-9</a></p>

<p>Starting Big</p>
<p>Adults typically have problems with learning grammatical relations such as agreement between nouns and their gendered articles (is the Spanish word for problem 'la problema' or 'el problema'?). Young children are much better at learning such arbitrary relations among words. Children's superior learning skills may be due to their age and brain flexibility. However, according to Naomi Havron and her colleagues, children's advantage in grammar learning may also be due to their inability to read. This idea is based on Inbal Arnon's Starting Big hypothesis, which states that younger children are better learners because they focus more on multiword units and less on individual words. The researchers predicted that children should excel at learning certain grammatical relations between words before they become literate. After learning how to read, they should pay more attention to single words, which hinders learning relations between words.</p>
<p>An alien language</p>
<p>To test children's learning abilities, the researchers created a new language. This artificial language contained eight new nouns for existing items, such as &quot;keba&quot; for clock and &quot;nadi&quot; for chair, paired with one of two new 'gender articles': &quot;do&quot; or &quot;ga.&quot; On screen, a green cartoon alien with three eyes would point at the object and say the alien equivalent of &quot;this is the clock&quot; (e.g. &quot;kamek do keba&quot;). All sentences started with &quot;kamek&quot; followed by a pause, but there was no pause between the article and noun. A group of 31 first graders (6-year-olds) and 27 third graders (8-year-olds) from schools in Israel listened to all sentences in the alien language for about four minutes.</p>
<p>The researchers then tested the children on vocabulary (nouns) and grammar (gender agreement relations). To test vocabulary, the alien would use the wrong label (calling a clock a &quot;nadi&quot;). To test grammar, the alien would use the wrong gender article (calling a chair &quot;do nadi&quot; instead of &quot;ga nadi&quot;). In each trial, the alien would utter both the correct and the incorrect sentence (e.g. &quot;kamek ga nadi&quot; and &quot;kamek do nadi&quot;), after which children had to decide on the correct one. All children were tested again after six months, during which time the first graders had learned how to read. For the second testing session, the researchers used a similar language with a new set of gender articles and nouns. Would literacy affect the 6-year-olds' learning patterns?</p>
<p>The effect of literacy</p>
<p>The preliterate 6-year-olds were better at learning grammatical relations than at learning nouns. Their score on grammatical relations was well above chance (64% correct), while their performance on nouns was at chance (50% correct). The 8-year-olds were equally good at learning grammar and vocabulary, scoring above 65% correct in both sessions. After only six months of reading instruction, the first graders showed the same pattern as the third graders. The now literate 6-year-olds performed equally well on grammatical relations (61% correct) and nouns (57% correct). As expected, their grammatical agreement advantage had disappeared after learning to read.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that literacy affects the way children learn a new language, and may come at a cost. According to first author Naomi Havron and MPI's Limor Raviv, this finding has implications for second language teaching: exposure to written input can help word learning, but may harm some aspects of grammar learning. Although learning to read has many benefits, the authors argue that &quot;there are advantages to learning a new language before you can read.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Literacy affects many aspects of cognitive and linguistic processing. Among them, it increases the salience of words as units of linguistic processing. Here, we explored the impact of literacy acquisition on children’s learning of an artifical language. Recent accounts of L1–L2 differences relate adults’ greater difficulty with language learning to their smaller reliance on multiword units. In particular, multiword units are claimed to be beneficial for learning opaque grammatical relations like grammatical gender. Since literacy impacts the reliance on words as units of processing, we ask if and how acquiring literacy may change children’s language-learning results. We looked at children’s success in learning novel noun labels relative to their success in learning article-noun gender agreement, before and after learning to read. We found that preliterate first graders were better at learning agreement (larger units) than at learning nouns (smaller units), and that the difference between the two trial types significantly decreased after these children acquired literacy. In contrast, literate third graders were as good in both trial types. These findings suggest that literacy affects not only language processing, but also leads to important differences in language learning. They support the idea that some of children’s advantage in language learning comes from their previous knowledge and experience with language—and specifically, their lack of experience with written texts.</p>

<p><em>the impact of bilingual environments on selective attention in infancy</em><br />
kyle j. comishen et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/desc.12797">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/desc.12797</a></p>

<p>The advantages of growing up in a bilingual home can start as early as six months of age, according to new research led by York University's Faculty of Health. In the study, infants who are exposed to more than one language show better attentional control than infants who are exposed to only one language. This means that exposure to bilingual environments should be considered a significant factor in the early development of attention in infancy, the researchers say, and could set the stage for lifelong cognitive benefits.</p>
<p>The research was conducted by Ellen Bialystok, Distinguished Research Professor of Psychology and Walter Gordon Research Chair of Lifespan Cognitive Development at York University and Scott Adler, associate professor in York's Department of Psychology and the Centre for Vision Research, along with lead author Kyle J. Comishen, a former Master's student in their lab. It will be published January 30, 2019 in Developmental Science.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted two separate studies in which infants' eye movements were measured to assess attention and learning. Half of the infants who were studied were being raised in monolingual environments while others were being raised in environments in which they heard two languages spoken approximately half of the time each. The infants were shown images as they lay in a crib equipped with a camera and screen, and their eye movements were tracked and recorded as they watched pictures appear above them, in different areas of the screen. The tracking was conducted 60 times for each infant.</p>
<p>&quot;By studying infants -- a population that does not yet speak any language -- we discovered that the real difference between monolingual and bilingual individuals later in life is not in the language itself, but rather, in the attention system used to focus on language,&quot; says Bialystok, co-senior author of the study. &quot;This study tells us that from the very earliest stage of development, the networks that are the basis for developing attention are forming differently in infants who are being raised in a bilingual environment. Why is that important? It's because attention is the basis for all cognition.&quot;</p>
<p>In the first study, the infants saw one of two images in the centre of the screen followed by another image appearing on either the left or right side of the screen. The babies learned to expect that if, for example, a pink and white image appears in the centre of the screen, it would be followed by an attractive target image on the left; If a blue and yellow image appeared in the centre, then the target would appear on the right. All the infants could learn these rules.</p>
<p>In the second study, which began in the same way, researchers switched the rule halfway through the experiment. When they tracked the babies' eye movements, they found that infants who were exposed to a bilingual environment were better at learning the new rule and at anticipating where the target image would appear. This is difficult because they needed to learn a new association and replace a successful response with a new contrasting one.</p>
<p>&quot;Infants only know which way to look if they can discriminate between the two pictures that appear in the centre,&quot; said Adler, co-senior author of the study. &quot;They will eventually anticipate the picture appearing on the right, for example, by making an eye movement even before that picture appears on the right. What we found was that the infants who were raised in bilingual environments were able to do this better after the rule is switched than those raised in a monolingual environment.&quot;</p>
<p>Anything that comes through the brain's processing system interacts with this attentional mechanism, says Adler. Therefore, language as well as visual information can influence the development of the attentional system.</p>
<p>Researchers say the experience of attending to a complex environment in which infants simultaneously process and contrast two languages may account for why infants raised in bilingual environments have greater attentional control than those raised in monolingual environments.</p>
<p>In previous research, bilingual children and adults outperformed monolinguals on some cognitive tasks that require them to switch responses or deal with conflict. The reason for those differences were thought to follow from the ongoing need for bilinguals to select which language to speak. This new study pushes back the explanation to a time before individuals are actively using languages and switching between them.</p>
<p>&quot;What is so ground-breaking about these results, is that they look at infants who are not bilingual yet and who are only hearing the bilingual environment. This is what's having the impact on cognitive performance,&quot; says Adler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Bilingualism has been observed to influence cognitive processing across the lifespan but whether bilingual environments have an effect on selective attention and attention strategies in infancy remains an unresolved question. In Study 1, infants exposed to monolingual or bilingual environments participated in an eye‐tracking cueing task in which they saw centrally presented stimuli followed by a target appearing on either the left or right side of the screen. Halfway through the trials, the central stimuli reliably predicted targets' locations. In Study 2, the first half of the trials consisted of centrally presented cues that predicted targets' locations; in the second half, the cue–target location relation switched. All infants performed similarly in Study 1, but in Study 2 infants raised in bilingual, but not monolingual, environments were able to successfully update their expectations by making more correct anticipatory eye movements to the target and expressing faster reactive eye latencies toward the target in the post‐switch condition. The experience of attending to a complex environment in which infants simultaneously process and contrast two languages may account for why infants raised in bilingual environments have greater attentional control than those raised in monolingual environments.</p>

<p>&quot;I learn,&quot; &quot;you learn,&quot; &quot;she learns,&quot; &quot;they learn,&quot; yet, according to a surprising new linguistic study, in countries where the dominant language allows personal pronouns such as 'I' to be omitted, learning suffers.</p>
<p>advertisement<br />
The research by Dr Horst Feldmann of the University of Bath also finds that countries where the dominant languages permit pronoun drop have lower secondary school enrollment rates. This is the first study to analyse the effects of pronoun drop rules on education. It has just been published in the journal Kyklos.</p>
<p>The term 'pronoun drop' refers to grammatical rules that allow speakers to drop a personal pronoun (such as 'I') when it is used as a subject of a sentence. These rules are in fact commonplace around the world -- including in Spanish, Arabic and Eastern languages such as Chinese and Japanese.</p>
<p>Permitting speakers to drop a personal pronoun, Dr Feldmann explained, serves to de-emphasise the significance of the individual. Whereas languages of traditionally collectivist cultures do not require the use of 'I' in sentences, countries where personal pronouns are enforced tend to be more individualistic in their cultural traditions. Examples include English, as well as German and Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>Dr Feldmann's study covers an exceptionally large number of individuals and countries. Specifically, to estimate the effect on peoples' educational attainment he used data on more than 114,000 individuals from 75 countries. To estimate the effect on enrollment rates he used data on 101 countries.</p>
<p>In both cases Dr Feldmann found that the magnitude of the effect is substantial, particularly among females.</p>
<p>Women who normally speak a pronoun drop language at home are roughly 10% less likely to have completed secondary or tertiary education than women who speak a non-pronoun drop language.</p>
<p>Equally, countries in which popularly-spoken languages permit personal pronoun drop have secondary enrollment rates of around 10% lower among girls, compared with countries in which the popularly spoken languages require the use of personal pronouns. In both types of analysis, the magnitude of the effect is slightly lower for males.</p>
<p>Dr Horst Feldmann of the University's Department of Economics explained: &quot;Rules permitting pronoun drop are likely to perpetuate ancient cultural values and norms -- formed and encoded in those rules in the distant past -- that give primacy to the collective over the individual.</p>
<p>&quot;Through such language rules, these ancestral cultural values and norms can still be effective nowadays -- inducing governments and families to invest comparatively little in the education of the young, as education usually increases the independence of the individual from both the state and the extended family and may reduce his or her commitment to these institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;While in many traditionally collectivist societies, collectivist norms are in retreat in contemporary culture, in such societies these ancient norms appear to live on and still adversely affect education today.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Feldmann included in his analysis numerous variables to statistically control for the impact of other factors influencing educational attainment and enrollment. These include income per person and religion.</p>
<p>The study builds on other recent economic research that highlights how linguistic structures, such as gender distinctions in grammar, can also affect both individual behaviour and collective outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> This paper empirically studies the human capital effects of grammatical rules that permit speakers to drop a personal pronoun when used as a subject of a sentence. By de‐emphasizing the significance of the individual, such languages may perpetuate ancient values and norms that give primacy to the collective, inducing governments and families to invest relatively little in education because education usually increases the individual's independence from both the state and the family and may thus reduce the individual's commitment to these institutions. Carrying out both an individual‐level and a country‐level analysis, the paper indeed finds negative effects of pronoun‐drop languages. The individual‐level analysis uses data on 114,894 individuals from 75 countries over 1999‐2014. It establishes that speakers of such languages have a lower probability of having completed secondary or tertiary education, compared with speakers of languages that do not allow pronoun drop. The country‐level analysis uses data from 101 countries over 1972‐2012. Consistent with the individual‐level analysis, it finds that countries where the dominant languages permit pronoun drop have lower secondary school enrollment rates. In both cases, the magnitude of the effect is substantial, particularly among females.</p>

<p><em>typing polytonic greek on mac</em><br />
available in ios via external bluetooth keyboard (add Greek as keyboard option in settings, attach bluetooth keyboard, select hardware keyboard option Greek polytonic), but very usable on mac:</p>
<p>system preferences - keyboard - input sources; add greek - polytonic</p>
<p>system preferences - keyboard - shortcuts - input sources; select a key combination for changing the input source, e.g. hyper2–`</p>
<p>type a combination of keys to specify accents for the letter, before you enter the accented letter:</p>
<p>|<br />
—: | :— | :—<br />
smooth breather | ᾽ | ‘<br />
rough breather | ῾ | “<br />
acute | ´ | ;<br />
diaresis | ¨ | :<br />
circumflex | ῀ | [<br />
iota subscript | ι | {<br />
grave | ` | ]<br />
grave (also) | ` | }<br />
circumflex with smooth breather | ῏ | -<br />
circumflex with rough breather | ῟ | _<br />
acute with smooth breather | ῎ | /<br />
acute with rough breather | ῞ | ?</p>
<p>you can get by with the single combining accents until you are comfortable with them, and then add the other keys as you gain speed. There are several other keys you can use, for grave with smooth or rough breather, diaresis with acute etc. ( ῍ ), ( ῝ ), ( ΅ )</p>
<p>Keyboardmaestro is very helpful in that it can keep the “locations” of its own shortcut keys the same across different input keyboards — for example when I use my normal em–space key combination, it is typed using the same physical keys on the keyboard and I don’t have to shift gears to use the other alphabet for those shortcuts (I still have to shift for system–integrated i.e. non–keyboardmaestro shortcuts such as copy and paste).</p>
<p>for rarer accents such as ῑ, ῡ, ᾱ, ῒ, ΐ, ῐ, ᾰ, I use keyboardmaestro macros to insert the characters; for even rarer accents such as ᾱ́, ῑ́, ῡ́, ᾰ́, ῐ́, I also use keyboardmaestro macros but need additionally to use the unicode combining acute ( ́ ) NB you can copy and paste that combining acute into your own macros to use it, or search for “combining acute” in the character viewer and copy from there.</p>
<p>keyboardmaestro is also very helpful for creating emacs–style bindings for often–used keys combinations that would be awkward to type in sublime text when the keyboard input method is set to greek polytonic, e.g. I set hyper2–l (dvorak equivalent ctrl–n) to do “move cursor down to next line, after inserting a full stop”, hyper2–d (dvorak equivalent ctrl–e) to do “move cursor to end of line”.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>appears to use only combining unicode accents, as is recommended in unicode standard. so in certain fonts may not be usable for any character with multiple accents or capitals, for example Ὂ (combining accent) instead of Ὂ (non–combining accent) appears strange in helvetica neue thin but fine in helvetica neue regular Ὂ and Ὂ because what apple’s ios font system is doing is substituting a different font for characters which it cannot represent in the chosen font (notice how the non–combining accent in helvetica neue thin is a different stroke width)<br />

<p>i find the pen tool at 0.5 point width (100% magnification) and 95% opacity nice — but if you change magnification often, consider the (constant width) wire tool instead. it won’t look as organic at 100%, but may look better at different magnifications because it stays the same width on screen no matter the magnification</p>
