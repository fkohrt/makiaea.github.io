<li>change is easy but requires multiple small bursts of effort it is in their interest to believe change is hard. then their books and opinions are worth more because the problem they purport to solve is greater</li>
</ul>
<h2>like any small difference in temperament, a slightly more flexible or less rigid conception of change and reality accumulates into what looks like a big difference in temperament and outlook compared to others.</h2>
<h2>All it takes is a very small tendency, to be magnified and multiplied and compounded over time, to result in what seems like a huge difference. This means that change is very possible, because in reality only a very small change must occur in order for a large change to result. But many people still believe in the myth of change being difficult and requiring massive effort, ability or will, so they still believe they cannot do it, and by extension, that nobody else can do it either.</h2>

<p><em>reversed procrastination by focal disruption of medial frontal cortex</em><br />

<p>•Voluntary reaction times are slower and more variable than neural noise explains<br />
•Such procrastination is theorized to reflect a neural race selecting each action<br />
•Electrically disrupting medial frontal cortex reverses procrastination<br />
•A cardinal prediction of race models of action in the brain is thereby confirmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enduring puzzle in the neuroscience of voluntary action is the origin of the remarkably wide dispersion of the reaction time distribution, an interval far greater than is explained by synaptic or signal transductive noise [1, 2]. That we are able to change our planned actions—a key criterion of volition <a href="04973">3</a>—so close to the time of their onset implies decision-making must reach deep into the execution of action itself [4, 5, 6]. It has been influentially suggested the reaction time distribution therefore reflects deliberate neural procrastination <a href="04573">7</a>, giving alternative response tendencies sufficient time for fair competition in pursuing a decision threshold that determines which one is behaviorally manifest: a race model, where action selection and execution are closely interrelated [8, 9, 10, 11]. Although the medial frontal cortex exhibits a sensitivity to reaction time on functional imaging that is consistent with such a mechanism [12, 13, 14], direct evidence from disruptive studies has hitherto been lacking. If movement-generating and movement-delaying neural substrates are closely co-localized here, a large-scale lesion will inevitably mask any acceleration, for the movement itself could be disrupted. Circumventing this problem, here we observed focal intracranial electrical disruption of the medial frontal wall in the context of the pre-surgical evaluation of two patients with epilepsy temporarily reversing such hypothesized procrastination. Effector-specific behavioral acceleration, time-locked to the period of electrical disruption, occurred exclusively at a specific locus at the ventral border of the pre-supplementary motor area. A cardinal prediction of race models of voluntary action is thereby substantiated in the human brain</p>

<h2>planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>plans different from schedules</em><br />
for many people, a plan, something one prepares to do, is the same as a schedule, a timetable in which to do it. this is because people believe that one way to achieve goals is to systematically progress towards them. however, there are other ways both to live and to achieve goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able, at times, to live unplanned and unscheduled and yet at the same time wielding the discipline to carry on; this is something that people my not remember how to do because they have been taught that it is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>serendipity</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>symbolic photograph</strong> this is a serendipitous photograph. it was taken within thirty seconds of entering one of the hothouses at kew gardens in london, england. after that the hothouse was closed for the day. can you see certain details in the photograph? the sky is reflected in the water. it turns out that maki was due to leave for san diego, halfway around the world from london, in a few days time so this was the last time in two years that he would have a chance to take this particular photograph. he was lucky. but there was also serendipity. the photograph shows the scene in a hothouse in england, where these tropical water–flowers are blooming. the symbolism is very appropriate because it is an interesting metaphor for the blooming of human spirit in unlikely surroundings. the cast–iron latticework of the roof appears in the reflection, indicating the human agency in the presence of th eflowers in that location. but nevertheless, the flowers are beautiful. they are not beautiful because anyone placed them there, but are beautiful just as they are. this is what made this photograph an ideal one to symbolise the book somesuch(link).</p>

<p><em>the travels and adventures of serendipity: a study in sociological semantics and the sociology of science</em> robert merton, elinor barber 2004 isbn0691117543 p192<br />
“for it is langmuir's conviction that 'calculation upon the unforseen' is not only consonant with scientific principle but that it will also pay off in other ways that are highly desirable. Calculation upon divergent phenomena will produce results that are both unexpected <em>and</em> important: 'You don't know all the things that are going to happen. Too many of them are unexpected. And it is many of these unexpected things that are going to be the most profitable, the most useful things you do.’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The crowning reward of such general planning is that it will preserve a freedom of inquiry, a freedom of opportunity, that is not only rational and efficient but is also part of a good way of life. 'Freedom of opportunity as developd by democracy is the best human reaction to divergent phenomena. We may, in fact, define 'freedom' as 'the opportunity to profit from the unexpected.' 'It is in the best interests of science and of democratic society therefore that serendipity be held in high esteem.”</p>

<h1><em>the brain adapts to dishonesty</em></h1>

<h2>Dishonesty is an integral part of our social world, influencing domains ranging from finance and politics to personal relationships. Anecdotally, digressions from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it. Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger transgressions.</h2>
