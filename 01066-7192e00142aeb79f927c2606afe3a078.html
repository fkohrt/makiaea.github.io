<h2>The vaginal microbiome and preterm birth</h2>

<h2>vaginal microbiomes of 45 women who gave birth prematurely and 90 whose pregnancies extended through term. About 78 percent of the women in each group were African American.</h2>
<p>&quot;Given where VCU is -- in the Richmond area -- you have a predominantly African American population, and so that's who shows up at the VCU clinics,&quot; Huzurbazar said. &quot;That's a really useful thing because a lot of other studies are mostly done with large groups of people of European descent.&quot;</p>
<p>Another useful thing was the timespan the data represented. Because the data spanned all trimesters of pregnancy -- and even extended into the postpartum period -- the researchers could track how the bacterial communities changed over time.</p>
<p>They found that by the second trimester, women who would eventually give birth prematurely harbored much larger populations of certain vaginal bacteria than their full-term counterparts did. In addition, they had smaller populations of Lactobacillus crispatus. That's noteworthy because a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome is a hallmark of a healthy reproductive tract. These differences only grew more pronounced as the pregnancies progressed.</p>
<p>The researchers also discovered that the microbial profile associated with preterm birth correlated to a greater presence of proinflammatory proteins -- called cytokines -- in vaginal fluid.</p>
<p>&quot;Microbiome data is relatively new -- especially the vaginal microbiome -- so a lot of it is looking at the data and figuring out what you see in terms of correlation,&quot; Huzurbazar said. &quot;The next steps are doing the basic science to find out, for example, how the cytokines potentially affect preterm birth.&quot;</p>
<p>Their findings may influence how pregnant women's risk of preterm birth is assessed. For example, perhaps their vaginal microbiomes could be screened for the bacteria at issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know why the microbiome looks different. A large part of the microbiome -- whether it's gut or vaginal or whatever -- might have to do with access to healthcare, socioeconomic factors and so on,&quot; Huzurbazar said. &quot;The bigger goal is to try to figure out early on which women are more likely to have preterm births. Then you can do something about it because you have some time for intervention.&quot;</p>
<h2>The incidence of preterm birth exceeds 10% worldwide. There are significant disparities in the frequency of preterm birth among populations within countries, and women of African ancestry disproportionately bear the burden of risk in the United States. In the present study, we report a community resource that includes ‘omics’ data from approximately 12,000 samples as part of the integrative Human Microbiome Project. Longitudinal analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and cytokine profiles from 45 preterm and 90 term birth controls identified harbingers of preterm birth in this cohort of women predominantly of African ancestry. Women who delivered preterm exhibited significantly lower vaginal levels of Lactobacillus crispatus and higher levels of BVAB1, Sneathia amnii, TM7-H1, a group of Prevotella species and nine additional taxa. The first representative genomes of BVAB1 and TM7-H1 are described. Preterm-birth-associated taxa were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in vaginal fluid. These findings highlight new opportunities for assessment of the risk of preterm birth.</h2>
