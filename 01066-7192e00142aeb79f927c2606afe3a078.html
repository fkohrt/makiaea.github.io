<h2>The Association between Mushroom Consumption and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study in Singapore</h2>
<h2>Lei Feng</h2>

<h2>A portion was defined as three quarters of a cup of cooked mushrooms with an average weight of around 150 grams. Two portions would be equivalent to approximately half a plate. While the portion sizes act as a guideline, it was shown that even one small portion of mushrooms a week may still be beneficial to reduce chances of MCI.</h2>
<p>&quot;This correlation is surprising and encouraging. It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline,&quot; said Assistant Professor Lei Feng, who is from the NUS Department of Psychological Medicine, and the lead author of this work.</p>
<p>The six-year study, which was conducted from 2011 to 2017, collected data from more than 600 Chinese seniors over the age of 60 living in Singapore. The research was carried out with support from the Life Sciences Institute and the Mind Science Centre at NUS, as well as the Singapore Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council. The results were published online in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease on 12 March 2019.</p>
<p>Determining MCI in seniors</p>
<p>MCI is typically viewed as the stage between the cognitive decline of normal ageing and the more serious decline of dementia. Seniors afflicted with MCI often display some form of memory loss or forgetfulness and may also show deficit on other cognitive function such as language, attention and visuospatial abilities. However, the changes can be subtle, as they do not experience disabling cognitive deficits that affect everyday life activities, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.</p>
<p>&quot;People with MCI are still able to carry out their normal daily activities. So, what we had to determine in this study is whether these seniors had poorer performance on standard neuropsychologist tests than other people of the same age and education background,&quot; explained Asst Prof Feng. &quot;Neuropsychological tests are specifically designed tasks that can measure various aspects of a person's cognitive abilities. In fact, some of the tests we used in this study are adopted from commonly used IQ test battery, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).&quot;</p>
<p>As such, the researchers conducted extensive interviews and tests with the senior citizens to determine an accurate diagnosis. &quot;The interview takes into account demographic information, medical history, psychological factors, and dietary habits. A nurse will measure blood pressure, weight, height, handgrip, and walking speed. They will also do a simple screen test on cognition, depression, anxiety,&quot; said Asst Prof Feng.</p>
<p>After this, a two-hour standard neuropsychological assessment was performed, along with a dementia rating. The overall results of these tests were discussed in depth with expert psychiatrists involved in the study to get a diagnostic consensus.</p>
<p>Mushrooms and cognitive impairment</p>
<p>Six commonly consumed mushrooms in Singapore were referenced in the study. They were golden, oyster, shiitake and white button mushrooms, as well as dried and canned mushrooms. However, it is likely that other mushrooms not referenced would also have beneficial effects.</p>
<p>The researchers believe the reason for the reduced prevalence of MCI in mushroom eaters may be down to a specific compound found in almost all varieties. &quot;We're very interested in a compound called ergothioneine (ET),&quot; said Dr Irwin Cheah, Senior Research Fellow at the NUS Department of Biochemistry. &quot;ET is a unique antioxidant and anti-inflammatory which humans are unable to synthesise on their own. But it can be obtained from dietary sources, one of the main ones being mushrooms.&quot;</p>
<p>An earlier study by the team on elderly Singaporeans revealed that plasma levels of ET in participants with MCI were significantly lower than age-matched healthy individuals. The work, which was published in the journal Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications in 2016, led to the belief that a deficiency in ET may be a risk factor for neurodegeneration, and increasing ET intake through mushroom consumption might possibly promote cognitive health.</p>
<p>Other compounds contained within mushrooms may also be advantageous for decreasing the risk of cognitive decline. Certain hericenones, erinacines, scabronines and dictyophorines may promote the synthesis of nerve growth factors. Bioactive compounds in mushrooms may also protect the brain from neurodegeneration by inhibiting production of beta amyloid and phosphorylated tau, and acetylcholinesterase.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>The potential next stage of research for the team is to perform a randomised controlled trial with the pure compound of ET and other plant-based ingredients, such as L-theanine and catechins from tea leaves, to determine the efficacy of such phytonutrients in delaying cognitive decline. Such interventional studies will lead to more robust conclusion on causal relationship. In addition, Asst Prof Feng and his team also hope to identify other dietary factors that could be associated with healthy brain ageing and reduced risk of age-related conditions in the future.</p>
<h2>We examined the cross-sectional association between mushroom intake and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using data from 663 participants aged 60 and above from the Diet and Healthy Aging (DaHA) study in Singapore. Compared with participants who consumed mushrooms less than once per week, participants who consumed mushrooms &gt;2 portions per week had reduced odds of having MCI (odds ratio = 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.78, p = 0.006) and this association was independent of age, gender, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, physical activities, and social activities. Our cross-sectional data support the potential role of mushrooms and their bioactive compounds in delaying neurodegeneration.</h2>
<h2>Regulation of arousal via online neurofeedback improves human performance in a demanding sensory-motor task.</h2>
<h2>Josef Faller</h2>
<h2><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817207116">dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817207116</a></h2>

<h2>online neurofeedback to modify an individual's arousal state to improve performance in a demanding sensory motor task, such as flying a plane or driving in suboptimal conditions. The researchers used a brain computer interface (BCI) to monitor, through electroencephalography (EEG) in real time, the arousal states of the study participants when they were engaged in a virtual reality aerial navigation task. The system generated a neurofeedback signal that helped participants to decrease their arousal in particularly difficult flight situations, which in turn improved participants' performance. The study was published today by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</h2>
<p>&quot;The whole question of how you can get into the zone, whether you're a baseball hitter or a stock trader or a fighter pilot, has always been an intriguing one,&quot; says Paul Sajda, professor of biomedical engineering (BME), electrical engineering, and radiology, who led the study. &quot;Our work shows that we can use feedback generated from our own brain activity to shift our arousal state in ways that significantly improve our performance in difficult tasks -- so we can hit that home run or land on a carrier deck without crashing.&quot;</p>
<p>The 20 subjects in the study were immersed in a virtual reality scenario in which they had to navigate a simulated airplane through rectangular boundaries. Known as a boundary avoidance task, this demanding sensory-motor task model created cognitive stresses, such as making the boxes narrower every 30 seconds, that escalated arousal and quickly resulted in task failure -- missing or crashing into the boundary. But when the researchers used neurofeedback, the subjects did better, were able to fly longer while performing the difficult tasks that required high levels of visual and motor coordination.</p>
<p>There were three feedback conditions (BCI, sham, and silence) randomly assigned for every new flight attempt. In the BCI condition, subjects heard the sound of a low-rate synthetic heartbeat that was continuously modulated in loudness as a function of the level of inferred task-dependent arousal, as decoded from the EEG. The higher that level of arousal, the louder the feedback and vice versa. Participants' task performance in the BCI condition, measured as time and distance over which the subject can navigate before failure, was increased by around 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Simultaneous measurements of pupil dilation and heart rate variability showed that the neurofeedback indeed reduced arousal, causing the subjects to remain calm and fly beyond the point at which they would normally fail,&quot; says Josef Faller, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral research scientist in BME. &quot;Our work is the first demonstration of a BCI system that uses online neurofeedback to shift arousal state and improve task performance in accordance with the Yerkes-Dodson law.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yerkes-Dodson law is a well-established and intensively studied law in behavioral psychology about the relationship between arousal and performance. Developed in 1908, it posits an inverse-relationship between arousal and task performance, that there is a state of arousal that is optimal for behavioral performance in a given task. In this new study, the researchers showed that they could use neurofeedback in real time to move an individual's arousal from the right side of the Yerkes-Dodson curve to the left, toward a state of improved performance.</p>
<p>&quot;What's exciting about our new approach is that it is applicable to different task domains,&quot; Sajda adds. &quot;This includes clinical applications that use self-regulation as a targeted treatment, such as mental illness.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers are now studying how neurofeedback can be used to regulate arousal and emotion for clinical conditions such as PTSD. They are also exploring how they might use online monitoring of arousal and cognitive control to inform human-agent teaming, when a robot and a human work together in a high-stress situation like a rescue. If the robot has information on the human's arousal state, it could choose its tasks in a way that reduces its teammate's arousal, pushing her/him into an ideal performance zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Good human-agent teams, like the Navy SEALS, do this already, but that is because the human-agents can read facial expressions, voice patterns, etc., of their teammates to infer arousal and stress levels,&quot; Sajda says. &quot;We envision our system being a better way to communicate not just this type of information, but much more to a robot-agent.&quot;</p>
<h2>Our ability to make optimal decisions, judgments, and actions in real-world dynamic environments depends on our state of arousal. We show that we can use electroencephalography-based feedback to shift an individual’s arousal so that their task performance increases significantly. This work demonstrates a closed-loop brain–computer interface for dynamically shifting arousal to affect online task performance in accordance with the Yerkes and Dodson law. The approach is potentially applicable to different task domains and/or for clinical applications that utilize self-regulation as a targeted treatment, such as in mental illness.</h2>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Our state of arousal can significantly affect our ability to make optimal decisions, judgments, and actions in real-world dynamic environments. The Yerkes–Dodson law, which posits an inverse-U relationship between arousal and task performance, suggests that there is a state of arousal that is optimal for behavioral performance in a given task. Here we show that we can use online neurofeedback to shift an individual’s arousal from the right side of the Yerkes–Dodson curve to the left toward a state of improved performance. Specifically, we use a brain–computer interface (BCI) that uses information in the EEG to generate a neurofeedback signal that dynamically adjusts an individual’s arousal state when they are engaged in a boundary-avoidance task (BAT). The BAT is a demanding sensory-motor task paradigm that we implement as an aerial navigation task in virtual reality and which creates cognitive conditions that escalate arousal and quickly results in task failure (e.g., missing or crashing into the boundary). We demonstrate that task performance, measured as time and distance over which the subject can navigate before failure, is significantly increased when veridical neurofeedback is provided. Simultaneous measurements of pupil dilation and heart-rate variability show that the neurofeedback indeed reduces arousal. Our work demonstrates a BCI system that uses online neurofeedback to shift arousal state and increase task performance in accordance with the Yerkes–Dodson law.</p>

<h2>Despite their simplicity, 1-millimeter-long nematodes called Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) share an important limitation with humans: They cannot make B12 and must get all they need from their diet. In a study published today in PLOS Genetics, researchers from the lab of Rice biochemist and cancer researcher Natasha Kirienko describe how a B12-deficient diet harms C. elegans' health at a cellular level, reducing the worms' ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). The research showed that the reduced ability to break down BCAAs led to a toxic buildup of partially metabolized BCAA byproducts that damaged mitochondrial health.</h2>
<p>Researchers studied the health of two populations of worms, one with a diet sufficient in B12 and another that got too little B12 from its diet. Like the second population of worms, at least 10 percent of U.S. adults get too little B12 in their diet, a risk that increases with age.</p>
<p>&quot;We used C. elegans to study the effect of diet on a host and found that one kind of food was able to dramatically increase resistance to multiple stressors -- like heat and free radicals -- as well as to pathogens,&quot; said Kirienko, assistant professor of biosciences and a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research at Rice.</p>
<p>The lead scientist and co-author of the study, Kirienko said the B12 finding came as a surprise to her team, which first noticed the effect in experiments designed to investigate the mechanisms of pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), a potentially deadly disease in both worms and humans that infects some 51,000 U.S. hospital patients each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Her lab, like thousands of others worldwide, uses C. elegans as a model organism to study the effects of disease, drugs, toxins and other processes that affect humans and animals. In many C. elegans research labs worms are fed Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common human gut bacteria that is itself a model organism.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that switching between E. coli strain OP50 and strain HT115 dramatically altered the worm's stress tolerance,&quot; Kirienko said. She said it took about two years of follow-up studies to isolate the biochemical mechanism of stress and pathogen resistance. Her research team included study lead co-author Alexey Revtovich and co-author Ryan Lee.</p>
<p>&quot;The key difference between the two diets is the ability of HT115 and OP50 to acquire B12 from the environment,&quot; said Revtovich, a research scientist. &quot;We showed that HT115 is far more efficient at this, making about eight times as much of the protein that it needs to harvest B12 as compared to OP50.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers used numerous tests to confirm their results and rule out other possible mechanisms for the effect. They also found that C. elegans on an HT115 diet had the ability to resist infection by another deadly human pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis.</p>
<p>Lee, a Rice undergraduate student, said the study highlights the need for C. elegans labs worldwide to pay attention to the possible differential impacts of diet on experimental outcomes.</p>
<p>&quot;Some labs use OP50 as their standard food, and others use HT115 or even another strain of E. coli,&quot; Lee said. &quot;Our results show there are significant metabolic differences between these diets, and it's likely those differences could contribute to substantial uncertainty in research outcomes.&quot;</p>
<h2>Diet is a crucial determinant of organismal biology; interactions between the host, its diet, and its microbiota are critical to determining the health of an organism. A variety of genetic and biochemical means were used to assay stress sensitivity in C. elegans reared on two standard laboratory diets: E. coli OP50, the most commonly used food for C. elegans, or E. coli HT115, which is typically used for RNAi-mediated gene knockdown. We demonstrated that the relatively subtle shift to a diet of E. coli HT115 had a dramatic impact on C. elegans’s survival after exposure to pathogenic or abiotic stresses. Interestingly, this was independent of canonical host defense pathways. Instead the change arises from improvements in mitochondrial health, likely due to alleviation of a vitamin B12 deficiency exhibited by worms reared on an E. coli OP50 diet. Increasing B12 availability, by feeding on E. coli HT115, supplementing E. coli OP50 with exogenous vitamin B12, or overexpression of the B12 transporter, improved mitochondrial homeostasis and increased resistance. Loss of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene mmcm-1/MUT, which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, abolished these improvements, establishing a genetic basis for the E. coli OP50-incurred sensitivity. Our study forges a mechanistic link between a dietary deficiency (nutrition/microbiota) and a physiological consequence (host sensitivity), using the host-microbiota-diet framework.</h2>
<p>Author summary</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 deficiency affects ~10–40% of US adults, causing a range of health issues ranging from anemia to neurological defects. Here we provide a mechanistic link between dietary B12 deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our data indicate that B12 supports clearance of propionate, an intermediate of branched chain amino acid metabolism. Excess propionate compromises mitochondrial homeostasis, increasing susceptibility to abiotic stresses and bacterial pathogenesis. Importantly, this deficiency is absent when worms are fed a diet of E. coli HT115. C. elegans reared on E. coli OP50 are predisposed to a variety of health defects, including increased sensitivity to bacterial pathogens and stresses; these subtle phenotypes may be difficult to recapitulate under conventional RNAi feeding conditions with HT115, introducing unexpected experimental confounds. These findings reinforce the importance of considering the host-microbiota-nutrient axis when using this model organism.</p>

<h2>media, such as films, can shift social norms and combat corruption. In the case of &quot;Water of Gold,&quot; in Nigeria, the film clearly can change behavior. Or at least one version of the film.</h2>
<p>As it happens, &quot;Water of Gold&quot; is a &quot;Nollywood&quot; film (a loose term referring to the Nigerian film industry, the world's third-largest), commissioned for the purposes of this experiment. The movie, set in the Niger Delta, is a sibling story about two brothers. One brother, Natufe, is a poor fisherman. But Natufe's brother, Priye, leaves the Niger Delta, gets rich in business, returns home, and becomes a corrupt politician -- to the dismay of Natufe, who becomes outspoken about endemic local corruption.</p>
<p>In one version of &quot;Water of Gold,&quot; Natufe and another local activist set up a number for corruption reporting via text message and report instances of it, in scenes lasting five minutes. The other version does not contain those scenes. As the researchers discovered, &quot;Water of Gold&quot; does boost corruption reporting among viewers -- but only when it contains the extra 17 minutes showing the movie characters reporting corruption themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;When we added the extra scenes in the film, we found we did get more people reporting,&quot; says Rebecca Littman, now a postdoc at MIT and co-author of a new paper detailing the study's findings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the movie, and an accompanying mass text message, spurred 240 people in 106 small communities to send in concrete, specific reports of corruption over a seven-month period, a marked improvement compared to two national campaigns that generated 140 reports per year, in a country of 174 million people.</p>
<p>By combining texting with the film, it becomes &quot;less costly, and psychologically easier, to try this new thing,&quot; Littman says about corruption reporting.</p>
<p>The paper summarizing the results, &quot;Motivating the adoption of new community-minded behaviors: An empirical test in Nigeria,&quot; is being published today in Science Advances. The authors are Graeme Blair, of the University of California at Los Angeles; Littman, a researcher at the MIT Sloan School of Management; and Elizabeth Levy Paluck of the department of psychology at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University. Littman worked on the study as a graduate student at Princeton and is now a researcher in the Human Cooperation Laboratory, run by David Rand, an MIT Sloan professor.</p>
<p>To conduct the study, the researchers both commissioned &quot;Water of Gold&quot; and then rolled it out in careful fashion. Among the 106 places where the film was available, in 2013 and 2014, it was randomly determined whether viewers would see the &quot;treatment&quot; version of the film, with the corruption-reporting scenes, or the &quot;placebo&quot; version, which lacks them.</p>
<p>Both versions of the movie were also accompanied by a new system for reporting corruption via text message, which was displayed on the film's packaging and at the beginning, middle, and end of the film. Soon after handing out the films, the researchers then sent out a mass text message blast in each community, to all subscribers of the major mobile phone provider, so people simply had to reply in order to report corruption.</p>
<p>In the paper, the researchers term the film a &quot;norms intervention,&quot; designed to shift public opinion about civic standards. The texts are what they term a &quot;nudge intervention,&quot; intended to reduce the perceived logistical difficulties of reporting corruption.</p>
<p>The alteration of norms generated by the film involves making people feel that reporting corruption is a routine part of being a good citizen. In case people have not encountered others in their community who speak out against corruption, the film steps in to provide an example of reporting malfeasance.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can't show them their neighbor doing it, we can show them these influential, famous people doing it too,&quot; Littman says.</p>
<p>Nigeria would seem to provide a setting where anticorruption campaigns have room to grow. In a public-opinion survey conducted as part of the research project, just under 80 percent of Nigerians said they thought the police, civil servants, and state governments were corrupt. About 83 percent of respondents said they were &quot;angry&quot; about having to pay bribes to conduct business, with 60 percent being &quot;very angry&quot; about it.</p>
<p>It is also no accident that the study focused on the Niger Delta region, where massive amounts of oil production have not been accompanied by an equivalently substantial investment in services and infrastructure for citizens.</p>
<p>Even so, the number of corruption reports the research experiment generated was significant compared to two four-year campaigns, running from 2011 to 2015, conducted by a pair of organizations, Integrity Nigeria and BribeNigeria.com, which combined to collect 385 reports.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people were surprised that the campaign actually worked,&quot; Littman says</p>

<h2>builds on a 2011 study on rodents that found so-called 'time cells' in the hippocampus. These cells were shown to fire during the empty delay in-between two separate events, signaling the passage of time in the order of seconds. The idea is that these cells help bind together information about time when forming a memory.</h2>
<p>Lee and his team, including PhD candidate Sathesan Thavabalasingam and postdoc Edward O'Neil, wanted to see if a similar mechanism exists in the human hippocampus that helps integrate time information when memories are being formed.</p>
<p>To test this, 18 participants were asked to learn four short sequences or &quot;memories&quot; that differed in image content and duration between each event. During fMRI, a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity based on blood flow, they were asked to complete a recognition memory task and then mentally replay each sequence in as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>The researchers found that brain activity patterns in the anterior hippocampus reflected the duration of the empty periods in-between events, complementing what was found in the rodent study.</p>
<p>&quot;This study bridges a gap with the rodent study to show that our hippocampus is interested in time information in the order of seconds during long-term memory processing,&quot; says Thavabalasingam, who along with O'Neil are first authors on the study.</p>
<p>It's important to understand the mechanics of how time information is processed in the brain since it's one of several significant dimensions involved in forming long-term memories, adds Thavabalasingam.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't have a memory of an event without having some sort of experience of how long it took place. It's important to better understand how the brain processes the entire timeline of an experience, and how that's being represented in long-term memories,&quot; he says</p>
<h2>We demonstrate that multivariate patterns of activity in the human hippocampus during the recognition and cued mental replay of long-term sequence memories contain temporal structure information in the order of seconds. By using an experimental paradigm that required participants to remember the durations of empty intervals between visually presented scene images, our study provides evidence that the human hippocampus can represent elapsed time within a sequence of events in conjunction with other forms of information, such as event content. Our findings complement rodent studies that have shown that hippocampal neurons fire at specific times during the empty delay between two events and suggest a common hippocampal neural mechanism for representing temporal information in the service of episodic memory.</h2>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>There has been much interest in how the hippocampus codes time in support of episodic memory. Notably, while rodent hippocampal neurons, including populations in subfield CA1, have been shown to represent the passage of time in the order of seconds between events, there is limited support for a similar mechanism in humans. Specifically, there is no clear evidence that human hippocampal activity during long-term memory processing is sensitive to temporal duration information that spans seconds. To address this gap, we asked participants to first learn short event sequences that varied in image content and interval durations. During fMRI, participants then completed a recognition memory task, as well as a recall phase in which they were required to mentally replay each sequence in as much detail as possible. We found that individual sequences could be classified using activity patterns in the anterior hippocampus during recognition memory. Critically, successful classification was dependent on the conjunction of event content and temporal structure information (with unsuccessful classification of image content or interval duration alone), and further analyses suggested that the most informative voxels resided in the anterior CA1. Additionally, a classifier trained on anterior CA1 recognition data could successfully identify individual sequences from the mental replay data, suggesting that similar activity patterns supported participants’ recognition and recall memory. Our findings complement recent rodent hippocampal research, and provide evidence that long-term sequence memory representations in the human hippocampus can reflect duration information in the order of seconds.</p>

<h2>what makes people care about social and economic problems they may not necessarily face in their daily lives, and whether that concern is a function of how the problems are described.</h2>
<p>The team looked at several types of evidence showing that a problem exists. For example, statistics can describe the magnitude of the problem or they can be phrased in percentage terms -- such as the percentage of people facing a problem. They designed a series of studies to test which type of evidence increased people's engagement, either by making a donation, paying attention to an email or stating a concern.</p>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with a nonprofit in Ithaca, New York, that strives to increase access to affordable health care, including funding for a free clinic.</p>
<p>In the studies, likely new donors received solicitations by mail, members of the organization received a solicitation email, and study participants unaffiliated with the organization took a survey gauging their interest in access to affordable health care.</p>
<p>The messaging used in solicitations included combinations of high percentages, low percentages, case studies and raw numbers to describe the magnitude of the uninsured who can't afford health care.</p>
<p>For example, the potential donors received either a standard letter, one saying 57 percent of uninsured people couldn't afford the care they need, or one describing how a real uninsured person benefited from the nonprofit's services.</p>
<p>Across the board, the percentage-based evidence and human interest evidence tended to drive engagement, but talking about the overall magnitude of the problem didn't.</p>
<p>&quot;When you talk about the millions of children who are starving, or the millions of refugees who are seeking out a better life, it fails to have this emotional connection that tends to then motivate people to pay more attention and to become engaged,&quot; Levine said.</p>
<p>The study offers a model of what a meaningful collaboration between researchers and practitioners can look like.</p>
<p>&quot;Pull at people's emotional heartstrings,&quot; Levine said. &quot;You can do it with certain forms of statistical evidence. You can do it with sympathetic case studies. And that will move behavior and move attitudes.&quot;</p>
<h2>Some social and economic problems do not gain broad awareness. Yet others become prominent (and perhaps are alleviated) in part because they successfully engage the wider citizenry. In this paper, we investigate how the evidence used to describe problems affects public engagement. Using disparities in access to affordable health care—a focal aspect of economic inequality in the United States—as our main issue, we conduct a series of field and survey experiments showing how some forms of evidence reduce attitudinal and behavioral engagement while other forms increase them. Our results challenge common arguments about political communication and behavior, while also shedding new light on a central question in the study of politics: What determines when citizens become concerned about a social problem?</h2>

<h2>researchers surveyed small-scale fishermen in six European countries about their perceptions of and support for marine protected areas (MPAs).</h2>
<p>&quot;The Mediterranean and Black Seas are fished at biologically unsustainable levels, by the regions' fishing fleet, 80 per cent of which are small-scale fishers,&quot; said Nathan Bennett, lead author and research associate in the University of British Columbia's Institute for Ocean and Fisheries and in the ECOSEAS lab at the Université Côte d'Azur. &quot;Gaining local support for one of the area's common management tools -- marine protected areas (MPAs) -- is vital to ensure conservation measures are in place and successful in the long-run.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey focused on three key factors -- ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance -- and how these related to local support. Overall, respondents were supportive of marine protected areas overall with 29 per cent voicing strong support, and only 5.4 per cent expressing strong opposition. Ecologically, the respondents felt that MPAs had a positive impact for fish abundance and habitat quality.</p>
<p>Social impact indicators, including income, livelihoods, food security, knowledge, community social well-being, and connections to nature, were mostly neutral. However, the responses were not as optimistic for the 'fairness of the impacts' or for good governance indicators such as recognition, transparency, accountability, communication, participation, consultation and consent, conflict management, trust, rule of law, and legitimacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Results show that for small-scale fishers, perceptions of good governance and social impacts were stronger predictors than ecological effectiveness of their support for conservation efforts.&quot; said Bennett. &quot;This has important implications for conservation managers. Building relationships, ensuring transparency, managing conflicts and conducting outreach activities are important investments to ensure local people support conservation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The take home-message is that working with and communicating to stakeholders will foster support for conservation initiatives,&quot; said Paolo Guidetti, senior author and professor at the Université Côte d'Azur. &quot;We hope that this study will help governments and managers in the Mediterranean Sea, and elsewhere in the world, to create more effective marine protected areas.&quot;</p>
<h2>Local support is important for the longevity of conservation initiatives. The literature suggests that perceptions of ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance will influence levels of local support for conservation. This paper examines these relationships using data from a survey of small‐scale fishermen in 11 marine protected areas from six countries in the Mediterranean Sea. The survey queried small‐scale fishermen regarding perceptions and support for conservation. We constructed composite scores for three categories of perceptions—ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance—and tested the relationship with levels of support using ordinal regression models. While all three factors were positively correlated with support for conservation, perceptions of good governance and social impacts were stronger predictors of increasing support. These findings suggest that employing good governance processes and managing social impacts may be more important than ecological effectiveness for maintaining local support for conservation.</h2>

<h2>increased evolution of selfless traits -- such as sharing food and keeping watch for one another -- is mathematically equivalent to the decreased evolution of individually beneficial traits.</h2>
<p>&quot;They're two sides of the same coin,&quot; Fisher explains. &quot;On one side, traits evolve that benefit your kin, but don't benefit you, because you're helping your siblings or cousins. On the other side, traits that benefit you but cost your neighbours don't evolve, because you're causing damage to related individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>The work is part of the ongoing effort to understand the paradox of altruistic behaviour in the wild, explains Fisher, a research fellow in McMaster's Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour.</p>
<p>Fisher goes on to show that another way evolution can go backwards is through the evolution of an individual's negative effects on neighbours and group members. For example, a fast-growing tree may take all the sunlight, water and nutrients out of the environment, causing its neighbours to grow slowly. In the next generation, more trees are fast-growing but are also nasty neighbours. As a result, negative social effects are much more prevalent, and so everyone's growth is reduced.</p>
<p>&quot;That means evolution has gone backwards. Even though growing quickly is beneficial, because of these negative social effects, the population, on average, grows more slowly,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Fisher plans to travel to Ecuador this summer to study co-operative spiders, and whether changes in individual and group benefits can explain why co-operation diminishes at higher elevations.</p>
<h2>We generally expect traits to evolve in the same direction as selection. However, many organisms possess traits that appear to be costly for individuals, while plant and animal breeding experiments reveal that selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of “opposite responses to selection.” Using quantitative genetic models for the response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes direct selection, when individuals interact with others less related to them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss the likelihood of each of these occurring in nature and therefore summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be. This links several evolutionary phenomena within a single framework.</h2>
<h2>human rights have proven to be exclusionary – even within our own species. Its emergence as a set of legal and moral norms betrays the fact that the white, European, male property-owner is the paradigm case of ‘the human’: others, historically, have had to fight even to be seen as fully capable of bearing rights. International treaties have been required to address the rights of women, children, workers, LGBT people, indigenous communities and others, precisely because such ‘minorities’ were marginalised by the abstract idea of ‘the human’ of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Critics have also suggested that human rights norms are a Trojan horse for neo-imperialism, providing ideological cover for dubious ‘humanitarian’ interventions and capitalist plundering. In theory, human rights are for all humans, but it turns out that some people are more human than others.</h2>

<h2>Why does it feel that the time passes faster as we get older? What is the physical basis for the impression that some days are slower than others? Why do we tend to focus on the unusual (the surprise), not on the ever present? This article unveils the physics basis for these common observations. The reason is that the measurable ‘clock time’ is not the same as the time perceived by the human mind. The ‘mind time’ is a sequence of images, i.e. reflections of nature that are fed by stimuli from sensory organs. The rate at which changes in mental images are perceived decreases with age, because of several physical features that change with age: saccades frequency, body size, pathways degradation, etc. The misalignment between mental-image time and clock time serves to unite the voluminous observations of this phenomenon in the literature with the constructal law of evolution of flow architecture, as physics.</h2>
<h2>&quot;People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,&quot; said Bejan. &quot;It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.&quot;</h2>
<p>Bejan attributes this phenomenon to physical changes in the aging human body. As tangled webs of nerves and neurons mature, they grow in size and complexity, leading to longer paths for signals to traverse. As those paths then begin to age, they also degrade, giving more resistance to the flow of electrical signals.</p>
<p>These phenomena cause the rate at which new mental images are acquired and processed to decrease with age. This is evidenced by how often the eyes of infants move compared to adults, noted Bejan -- because infants process images faster than adults, their eyes move more often, acquiring and integrating more information.</p>
<p>The end result is that, because older people are viewing fewer new images in the same amount of actual time, it seems to them as though time is passing more quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;The human mind senses time changing when the perceived images change,&quot; said Bejan. &quot;The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings. Days seemed to last longer in your youth because the young mind receives more images during one day than the same mind in old age.&quot;</p>

<h2>to distinguish authentic from adulterated drugs and food by observing how they behave when disturbed by temperature changes or other causes. Two substances with identical compositions should respond the same way to a disturbance, and if two substances appear identical but respond differently, their composition must be different, they reasoned.</h2>
<p>McKenzie designed a set of experiments to test this idea. She loaded samples of pure olive oil, one of the world's most commonly adulterated foods, and cough syrup, which is often diluted or counterfeited in the developing world, into tiny channels on a microfluidic chip, and chilled it quickly in liquid nitrogen. A USB microscope camera filmed the samples reacting to the temperature change.</p>
<p>McKenzie and Grover wrote software that converts the video to a bitmap image. Because the image showed how the sample changed over time, the researchers called it a &quot;chronoprint.&quot;</p>
<p>The team then used image analysis algorithms to compare different chronoprints from the same substance. They found that each pure substance had a reliable chronoprint over multiple tests.</p>
<p>Next, they repeated the experiment with samples of olive oil that had been diluted with other oils and cough syrup diluted with water. The adulterated samples produced chronoprints that were different from the pure samples. The difference was so big, so obvious, and so consistent the researchers concluded that chronoprints and image analysis algorithms can reliably detect some types of food and drug fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;The significant visual differences between the samples were both unexpected and exciting, and with them being consistent we knew this could be a useful way to identify a wide range of samples,&quot; McKenzie said.</p>
<p>Grover said their technique creates a powerful new connection between chemistry and computer science.</p>
<p>&quot;By basically converting a chemical sample to an image, we can take advantage of all the different image analysis algorithms that computer scientists have developed,&quot; he said. &quot;And as those algorithms get better, our ability to chemically identify a sample should get better, too.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers used liquids in their experiments but note the method could also be used on solid materials dissolved in water, and other types of disturbance, such as heat or a centrifuge, could be used for substances that don't react well to freezing. The technique is easy to learn, making highly trained experts unnecessary. Chronoprinting requires hobbyist-grade equipment and software downloadable for free from Grover's lab website, putting it well within reach of government agencies and labs with limited resources.</p>

<h2>Using two-photon microscopy, Daniel Huber's team visualized the activity of hundreds of neurons in a mouse's somatosensory cortex as vibrations of different frequencies were delivered to its forepaw. Like in the auditory cortex, individual neurons were selectively tuned: they strongly responded to some frequencies and less so to others. &quot;It turns out that these neurons are preferentially tuned to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude, and that this combination corresponds to what the mouse actually perceives. In other words, a mouse is unable to distinguish a high-frequency vibration with a low amplitude from a low-frequency vibration with a higher amplitude,&quot; explains Mario Prsa, a researcher in Dr. Huber's team and the study's first author. &quot;It is the same psychoacoustic effect detected in the auditory system, where the perceived pitch of a sound changes with both frequency and loudness.&quot; Thus, despite the fact that sounds -- which travel through the air -- and vibrations -- which are transmitted through solid matter -- are processed by different sensory channels, they are both perceived and encoded similarly in the brain.</h2>

<p>In a second step, the researchers sought to identify the origin of the somatosensory stimuli involved by performing a detailed histological analysis of Pacinian corpuscles in mouse forelimb. Pacinian corpuscles are known to transduce high frequency vibrations in mammals and are densely expressed in the dermis of primate fingertips. &quot;Surprisingly, we found that the vibration responses in the mouse brain stem from Pacinian corpuscles located on the forearm bones, whereas they were totally absent in the paw's skin,&quot; explains Géraldine Cuenu, a student in the UNIGE master's programme in neurosciences, who took charge of this detailed analysis. Using optogenetics, the scientists confirmed the link between cortical responses and the particular configuration of mechanoreceptors in the forelimbs.</p>
<p>An ancestor of the hearing system?</p>
<p>Could it be that the particular distribution of vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptors along the bones of the forelimb acts as a seismograph to &quot;listen&quot; to vibrations? Vibratory stimuli are indeed used by a number of living organisms to communicate through plants, branches and other solid substrates. &quot;Our discoveries probably reveal the existence of an ancient sensory channel, which could be an evolutionary precursor of hearing,&quot; concludes Mario Prsa. This somewhat vestigial, yet highly sensitive modality might also explain how we are able to identify subtle clues linked to upcoming natural disasters, or why construction or traffic causes nuisances even when inaudible.</p>
<h2>Fine-scale characterization of genomic structural variation in the human genome reveals adaptive and biomedically relevant hotspots</h2>

<h2>Every person's genome is different, and the new study compared the DNA of more than 2,500 individuals.</h2>
<p>Scientists zeroed in on the sections of the genome that differ most between people, identifying 1,148 areas that harbor unusually high numbers of structural variants, including chunks of duplicated, deleted, inserted, inverted or repeated sections of DNA.</p>
<p>New insights on the malleability of human DNA</p>
<p>An examination of these &quot;hot spots&quot; revealed a complex evolutionary story.</p>
<p>Most are found in gene-poor regions of the genome, as expected. (Altering genes can lead to devastating health problems, so it makes sense that gene-rich areas would tend to be more heavily conserved through evolution, Gokcumen explains.)</p>
<p>However, a small subset of structural variant hot spots is found in parts of the genome that harbor important genes. In these hubs, genes linked to our sense of smell, blood and skin function, and immunity to disease are overrepresented, according to the study.</p>
<p>Balancing selection -- in which dueling evolutionary forces drive a species to preserve an array of traits -- may help to explain why these gene-heavy hot spots exist.</p>
<p>One example: In the study, a DNA deletion that increases a person's risk for a blood disorder called thalassemia was found in about 16 percent of genes in sub-Saharan African populations. While evolution mostly weeded this genetic variation out of human societies in other parts of the world, the variation persists in sub-Saharan Africa because it's valuable there, Gokcumen says: The deletion may confer resistance to malaria, a major disease in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an evolutionary reason why this mutation is lingering, despite its ill effects,&quot; he says. &quot;It's actually beneficial too, at least for some populations. Balancing selection is important for adaptation, and we think it contributes to the development of some structural variant hot spots.&quot;</p>
<p>If the findings on balancing selection showcase humanity's adaptability, a second result from the study hints at just how delicate we are -- at how easily problems can arise.</p>
<p>The conclusion has to do with the malleability of human DNA, and the possibility that some hot spots of variation may be located in sections of the genome that are, for biochemical reasons, more susceptible to being altered.</p>
<p>In most people, genetic mutations in these regions are not devastating. But in some cases, large genetic deletions that begin in one hotspot and end in another may result in the erasure of entire genes in between, leading to health complications, Gokcumen says.</p>
<p>One example: The study found that a number of consecutive structural variant hot spots lie on either side of the short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene, whose deletion can lead to a severe bone growth disorder that causes very short stature. In some people who are missing the SHOX gene, deletions of DNA began in one hotspot, spanned the entire SHOX gene, and ended in a second hotspot.</p>
<p>When Gokcumen and Lin ran statistical tests, they found that the start and end points of large genetic mutations with known medical relevance were found in structural variant hot spots more often than would be expected.</p>
<h2>Genomic structural variants (SVs) are distributed nonrandomly across the human genome. The “hotspots” of SVs have been implicated in evolutionary innovations, as well as medical conditions. However, the evolutionary and biomedical features of these hotspots remain incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed data from 2,504 genomes to construct a refined map of 1,148 SV hotspots in human genomes. We confirmed that segmental-duplication related nonallelic homologous recombination is an important mechanistic driver of SV hotspot formation. However, to our surprise, we also found that a majority of SVs in hotspots do not form through such recombination-based mechanisms, suggesting diverse mechanistic and selective forces shaping hotspots. Indeed, our evolutionary analyses showed that the majority of SV hotspots are within gene-poor regions and evolve under relaxed negative selection or neutrality. However, we still found a small subset of SV hotspots harboring genes that are enriched for anthropologically crucial functions and evolve under geography-specific and balancing adaptive forces. These include two independent hotspots on different chromosomes affecting alpha and beta hemoglobin gene clusters. Biomedically, we found that the SV hotspots coincide with breakpoints of clinically relevant, large de novo SVs, significantly more often than genome-wide expectations. For example, we showed that the breakpoints of multiple large SVs, which lead to idiopathic short stature, coincide with SV hotspots. Therefore, the mutational instability in SV hotpots likely enables chromosomal breaks that lead to pathogenic structural variation formations. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the mutational and adaptive landscape of the genome.</h2>

<h2>Many animals, such as migratory birds and sea turtles, have a geomagnetic sense that supports their biological navigation system. Although magnetoreception has been well-studied in these animals, scientists have not yet been able to determine whether humans share this ability.</h2>
<p>Geoscientist Joseph Kirschvink, neuroscientist Shin Shimojo, and their colleagues at Caltech and the University of Tokyo set out to address this long-standing question using electroencephalography to record adult participants' brain activity during magnetic field manipulations. Carefully controlled experiments revealed a decrease in alpha-band brain activity -- an established response to sensory input -- in some participants. The researchers replicated this effect in participants who responded strongly and confirmed these responses were tuned to the magnetic field of the Northern Hemisphere, where the study was conducted.</p>
<p>Future studies of magnetoreception in diverse human populations may provide new clues into the evolution and individual variation of this ancient sensory system.</p>
<h2>Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect.</h2>
<p>Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical 'quantum compass' mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.</p>
<p>Significance Statement Although many migrating and homing animals are sensitive to Earth’s magnetic field, most humans are not consciously aware of the geomagnetic stimuli that we encounter in everyday life. Either we have lost a shared, ancestral magnetosensory system, or the system lacks a conscious component with detectable neural activity but no apparent perceptual awareness by us. We found two classes of ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields that produce strong, specific and repeatable effects on human brainwave activity in the EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz); EEG discriminates in response to different geomagnetic field stimuli. Biophysical tests rule out all except the presence of a ferromagnetic transduction element, such as biologically-precipitated crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4).</p>
<h2>Measuring the impact of interaction between children of a matrilineal and a patriarchal culture on gender differences in risk aversion</h2>

<h2>gender differences in risk aversion are shaped by culture and the social environment and that those differences can shift, at least in children.</h2>
<p>&quot;Environment is extremely important in shaping risk aversion,&quot; said Elaine Liu, associate professor of economics and author of a paper on the subject published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. &quot;If we can teach girls that they should be more risk loving, perhaps that will shape their future decision-making.&quot;</p>
<p>Liu and co-author Sharon Xuejing Zuo of Fudan University looked at the behavior of children from two distinct cultures -- the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han -- who attended the same school in Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>When the children first began elementary school, Mosuo girls took more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls were less likely to take risks than Han boys, in keeping with their parents' cultural norms. But that began to change as the children were exposed to the other culture.</p>
<p>It worked both ways, Liu said. Mosuo girls became more risk-averse, while Han girls became more risk-loving.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a convergence,&quot; Liu said. &quot;The Mosuo girls took more risks than Han girls at the beginning, but their attitudes toward taking risks become more similar as they spent more time together.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers studied children in elementary and middle school; Liu said it's not clear whether the changes will be sustained as the children return to their home villages. She and Zuo hope to launch a long-term study to determine if the shift in attitudes toward risk-taking is permanent.</p>
<p>They measured students' attitudes toward risk-taking through a lottery-style game, offering the students six choices ranging from a guaranteed three-yuan payout to a 50/50 percent chance of winning 10 yuan or nothing. Ten yuan would allow the children to buy five notebooks or about five popsicles at a local store; the amount of the reward was chosen after consulting with school principals.</p>
<p>Liu and Zuo conducted their research in Yunnan, a province in southwestern China, because it is one of the few places where children from cultures with distinctly different gender norms come together in one place. But Liu said the basic discovery -- that risk aversion is quite malleable at a young age -- should be applicable across cultures.</p>
<p>&quot;Gender norms are slow to change, but there are social influences that could play a role in how we shape that behavior,&quot; Liu said. And that could have long-term economic consequences, she said, even potentially shrinking the gender pay gap if it led to women choosing riskier but higher-reward career paths.</p>
<h2>Studies show that women are more risk averse than men. We explore sources and malleability of such differences in a setting where children of two culturally distinct populations, the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han, come together to attend school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit individual risk attitudes from elementary and middle school students from the two populations. When they first enter school, Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after spending time in the majority-Han environment, Mosuo children adopt the risk preferences of the majority. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.</h2>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Many studies find that women are more risk averse than men. Why does such a gender gap exist, and how malleable is this gender gap in risk aversion? The paper takes advantage of a rare setting in which children of the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han attend the same schools in Yunnan, China to shed light on these questions. In particular, we exploit the fact that children would experience a shock in gender norms when they start to intermingle with children from other ethnic groups with the opposite gender norms at school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit risk attitudes from Mosuo and Han elementary and middle school students. We find that, at the time when they first enter school, Mosuo and Han children exhibit opposite gender norms—Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after Mosuo students spend more time with Han students, Mosuo girls become more and more risk averse. By age 11, Mosuo girls are also more risk averse than Mosuo boys. We also observe a shrinking gap in risk aversion for Han over time. Using random roommate assignment for boarding middle school students, we find Mosuo boys who have fewer Mosuo roommates behave more similarly to Han boys. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.</p>
<p>gender normrisksocializationpeerculture<br />
Many studies have found women to be more risk averse than men [see the handbook chapter by Eckel and Grossman (1)]. Several have suggested that this difference in attitudes toward risk taking could partially explain the difference in career choices between men and women, which could, in turn, lead to the gender wage gap (2, 3). Given the observed gender difference in risk attitudes and the importance of risk attitudes, it is necessary to understand the origin of these gaps. Are these biological differences, or are they the result of social environment? Furthermore, if they are a result of the surrounding social environment, how malleable is this gender gap in risk preference, and what mechanisms could affect risk attitudes?</p>
<p>This paper seeks to answer these questions by studying the risk-taking behaviors among the children of two ethnic groups in Yunnan, China with nearly opposite gender norms. Yunnan provides us with a rare setting in which children of the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han attend the same schools.* Within this setting, we examine how intermingling between children from these disparate cultural backgrounds affects their respective gendered behavior. According to Berry et al. (4), a child can choose to maintain his/her own cultural heritage, choose to adapt to the other culture, or both. Therefore, it is unclear whether socialization with groups of opposite gender norms enhances or reduces the gender differences in risk attitudes.</p>
<p>The Mosuo and Han differ in many ways, but most notably, they have distinctly different gender norms. The Mosuo are the only ethnic minority group in China that maintains a matrilineal culture.† A Mosuo family typically includes members bound by the ties of maternal kin, with the grandmother generally being the household head. Grandmothers, maternal granduncles, mothers, mothers’ brothers, mothers’ sisters, and children live in the same household (6, 7). Mosuo children are raised by the mother’s household, and the children’s father is often excluded from the household. In Mosuo society, women play an important role in the family decision making, which includes household labor arrangement, crop choices, and spending decisions (8). According to Shih (7) and Walsh (9), women in this society enjoy a social status that is higher than or equal to men. There is very limited evidence on why a matrilineal culture would promote risk-taking behaviors among women. One study has found a positive relationship between agriculture income and reproductive success (i.e., number of surviving children) of Mosuo women (10). Therefore, since Mosuo women are often the head of the household, risk-taking behaviors, which could lead to higher income, could be rewarding. An experimental economic paper by Gong and Yang (11) also rationalizes that Mosuo women (men) have more (less) economic responsibility and have more support from their maternal family; hence, they can take on more risk than other cultures.</p>
<p>Conversely, Han Chinese have been influenced by Confucianism for thousands of years. The traditional Han family system is patriarchal and patrilineal. The household head of the family is typically the oldest male, who is responsible for major decisions. Kinship in Han families is passed down through the male descent line: sons and their male offspring continue the family name, and they are expected to support their aging parents (12). Women’s status is traditionally subordinate to men. Although the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s challenged these traditional values, some vestiges of male dominance in Han culture remain (13). For example, the prevalence of sex-selected abortion due to a preference for sons is one piece of evidence that patriarchal and patrilineal influences are ingrained in Han culture (14).</p>
<p>For this study, we visited Yongning Township located in Ninglang County, Yunnan Province. Yongning has the largest Mosuo population. In this township, Mosuo and Han children attend the same schools, are taught by the same teachers, and interact daily. We conduct surveys and elicit risk preference of Mosuo and Han elementary and middle school children using incentivized experiments.</p>

<h2>oxidative stress leads to sleep. Oxidative stress is also believed to be a reason why we age and a cause of degenerative diseases.</h2>
<p>The researchers say the discovery brings us closer to understanding the still-mysterious function of sleep and offers new hope for the treatment of sleep disorders. It may also explain why, as is suspected, chronic lack of sleep shortens life.</p>
<p>Professor Gero Miesenböck, Director of Oxford University's Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, who led the Oxford team, said: 'It's no accident that oxygen tanks carry explosion hazard labels: uncontrolled combustion is dangerous. Animals, including humans, face a similar risk when they use the oxygen they breathe to convert food into energy: imperfectly contained combustion leads to &quot;oxidative stress&quot; in the cell. This is believed to be a cause of ageing and a culprit for the degenerative diseases that blight our later years. Our new research shows that oxidative stress also activates the neurons that control whether we go to sleep.'</p>
<p>The team studied the regulation of sleep in fruit flies -- the animal that also provided the first insight into the circadian clock nearly 50 years ago. Each fly has a special set of sleep-control neurons, brain cells that are also found in other animals and believed to exist in people. In previous research [Nature 2016; 536: 333-337], Professor Miesenböck's team discovered that these sleep-control neurons act like an on-off switch: if the neurons are electrically active, the fly is asleep; when they are silent, the fly is awake.</p>
<p>Dr Seoho Song, a former graduate student in the Miesenböck lab and one of the two lead authors of the study, said: 'We decided to look for the signals that switch the sleep-control neurons on. We knew from our earlier work that a main difference between sleep and waking is how much electrical current flows through two ion channels, called Shaker and Sandman. During sleep, most of the current goes through Shaker.'</p>
<p>Ion channels generate and control the electrical impulses through which brain cells communicate.</p>
<p>'This turned the big, intractable question &quot;Why do we sleep?&quot; into a concrete, solvable problem,' said Dr Song. 'What causes the electrical current to flow through Shaker?'</p>
<p>The team found the answer in a component of the Shaker channel itself.</p>
<p>Lead author and postdoctoral fellow in the Miesenböck group, Dr Anissa Kempf, explained: 'Suspended underneath the electrically conducting portion of Shaker is another part, like the gondola under a hot air balloon. A passenger in the gondola, the small molecule NADPH, flips back and forth between two chemical states -- this regulates the Shaker current. The state of NADPH, in turn, reflects the degree of oxidative stress the cell has experienced. Sleeplessness causes oxidative stress, and this drives the chemical conversion.'</p>
<p>In a striking demonstration of this mechanism, a flash of light that flipped the chemical state of NADPH put flies to sleep.</p>
<p>According to Professor Miesenböck, drugs that change the chemistry of Shaker-bound NADPH in the same way could be a powerful new type of sleeping pill.</p>
<p>'Sleep disturbances are very common,' he said, 'and sleeping pills are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. But existing medications carry risks of confusion, forgetfulness and addiction. Targeting the mechanism we have discovered could avoid some of these side effects.'</p>
<h2>The essential but enigmatic functions of sleep1,2 must be reflected in molecular changes sensed by the brain’s sleep-control systems. In the fruitfly Drosophila, about two dozen sleep-inducing neurons3 with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) adjust their electrical output to sleep need4, via the antagonistic regulation of two potassium conductances: the leak channel Sandman imposes silence during waking, whereas increased A-type currents through Shaker support tonic firing during sleep5. Here we show that oxidative byproducts of mitochondrial electron transport6,7 regulate the activity of dFB neurons through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor bound to the oxidoreductase domain8,9 of Shaker’s KVβ subunit, Hyperkinetic10,11. Sleep loss elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in dFB neurons, which register this rise by converting Hyperkinetic to the NADP+-bound form. The oxidation of the cofactor slows the inactivation of the A-type current and boosts the frequency of action potentials, thereby promoting sleep. Energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and sleep—three processes implicated independently in lifespan, ageing, and degenerative disease6,12,13,14—are thus mechanistically connected. KVβ substrates8,15,16 or inhibitors that alter the ratio of bound NADPH to NADP+ (and hence the record of sleep debt or waking time) represent prototypes of potential sleep-regulatory drugs.</h2>

<h2>The modern understanding of sleep is based on the classification of sleep into stages defined by their electroencephalography (EEG) signatures, but the underlying brain dynamics remain unclear. Here we aimed to move significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art description of sleep, and in particular to characterise the spatiotemporal complexity of whole-brain networks and state transitions during sleep. In order to obtain the most unbiased estimate of how whole-brain network states evolve through the human sleep cycle, we used a Markovian data-driven analysis of continuous neuroimaging data from 57 healthy participants falling asleep during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG. This Hidden Markov Model (HMM) facilitated discovery of the dynamic choreography between different whole-brain networks across the wake-non-REM sleep cycle. Notably, our results reveal key trajectories to switch within and between EEG-based sleep stages, while highlighting the heterogeneities of stage N1 sleep and wakefulness before and after sleep.</h2>
<h2>A distinct inferential mechanism for delusions in schizophrenia</h2>

<h2>An estimated 80-90 percent of individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders experience delusions -- false, but strongly held, beliefs that can be distressing and debilitating. Researchers have long suspected that delusions are caused by alterations in the ability to make inferences, which relies on observable evidence to shape beliefs. However, previous experiments have suggested that other cognitive processes may be involved.</h2>
<p>&quot;The experiments typically used to understand the link between inference and delusions have focused on cognitive and decision-making skills, but they haven't conclusively shown a link between inference-making and delusion severity,&quot; says Guillermo Horga, MD, PhD, the Florence Irving Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and lead author of the paper. &quot;We developed a novel experiment to determine whether delusions stem from abnormalities in inference.&quot;</p>
<p>In the experiment, Horga and his team asked 26 adults with schizophrenia, including 12 who were being treated with antipsychotic medications, and 25 healthy individuals to draw beads from one of two hidden jars. Participants were given money, which could be used to bet on the identity of the hidden jar. They were told that drawing additional beads would help them bet correctly, though it would diminish their winnings. Throughout the experiment, they were asked to rate the odds of their bet on the identity of the jar.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that patients who experienced more severe delusions tended to seek more information in the task before making a guess than their less-delusional counterparts. This is a truly novel finding, and it helps confirm the fact that rigidity is an important part of delusional beliefs,&quot; says Horga.</p>
<p>Using computational modeling, the researchers developed a quantitative framework casting delusions as &quot;sticky&quot; beliefs that evolve in an unusually slow way. This may explain why delusional patients seek more information than non-delusional individuals. It could also help to identify new treatment approaches, such as neurostimulation of the prefrontal brain areas involved in updating beliefs, or cognitive training to shape inference-making.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous work suggested that psychotic patients 'jump to conclusions,' but in our study we saw that individuals with more delusional beliefs took more beads from the jar before they made up their minds,&quot; Horga continues. &quot;While participants with schizophrenia jumped to conclusions more than healthy individuals, delusions specifically were associated with slower change in individuals' beliefs.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, Lawrence C. Kolb Professor and Chairman of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, commented that &quot;delusions are among the most common and intractable symptoms of psychotic disorders. This innovative research casts delusions in a new context which allows for novel cognitive therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing and disrupting delusional thoughts.&quot;</p>
<h2>Delusions, a core symptom of psychosis, are false beliefs that are rigidly held with strong conviction despite contradictory evidence. Alterations in inferential processes have long been proposed to underlie delusional pathology, but previous attempts to show this have failed to yield compelling evidence for a specific relationship between inferential abnormalities and delusional severity in schizophrenia. Using a novel, incentivized information-sampling task (a modified version of the beads task), alongside well-characterized decision-making tasks, we sought a mechanistic understanding of delusions in a sample of medicated and unmedicated patients with schizophrenia who exhibited a wide range of delusion severity. In this novel task, participants chose whether to draw beads from one of two hidden jars or to guess the identity of the hidden jar, in order to minimize financial loss from a monetary endowment, and concurrently reported their probability estimates for the hidden jar. We found that patients with higher delusion severity exhibited increased information seeking (i.e. increased draws-to-decision behaviour). This increase was highly specific to delusion severity as compared to the severity of other psychotic symptoms, working-memory capacity, and other clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. Delusion-related increases in information seeking were present in unmedicated patients, indicating that they were unlikely due to antipsychotic medication. In addition, after adjusting for delusion severity, patients as a whole exhibited decreased information seeking relative to healthy individuals, a decrease that correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Computational analyses of reported probability estimates further showed that more delusional patients exhibited abnormal belief updating characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed early in the inferential process, a feature that correlated with increased information seeking in patients. Other decision-making parameters that could have theoretically explained the delusion effects, such as those related to subjective valuation, were uncorrelated with both delusional severity and information seeking among the patients. In turn, we found some preliminary evidence that subjective valuation (rather than belief updating) may explain group differences in information seeking unrelated to delusions. Together, these results suggest that abnormalities in belief updating, characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed by incorporating information presented earlier in the inferential process, may be a core computational mechanism of delusional ideation in psychosis. Our results thus provide direct empirical support for an inferential mechanism that naturally captures the characteristic rigidity associated with delusional beliefs.</h2>

<h2>energy leaves its environmental footprint home.</h2>
<p>In this month's journal Applied Energy, MSU researchers examine China's flow of virtual energy -- the energy used to produce goods and products in one place that are shipped away. What they found was that virtual energy flowed from less-populated, energy-scarce areas in China's western regions to booming cities in the energy-abundant east.</p>
<p>In fact, the virtual energy transferred west to east was much greater than the physical energy that moves through China's massive infrastructure investment, the West-To-East Electricity Transmission Project. China is a powerful model of energy use, having surpassed the United States. In 2013, nearly 22 percent of global energy use occurred in China.</p>
<p>Conserving energy and managing its accompanying environmental impacts are a growing concern across the world, and it is crucial to take a holistic look at all the ways energy is used and moved,&quot; said Jianguo &quot;Jack&quot; Liu, Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability of MSU's Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability (CSIS). &quot;Only when we understand the full picture of who is producing energy and who is consuming it in all its forms can we make effective policy decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>Virtual energy is considered critical to avoiding regional energy crises since commodities traded from one location to another include virtual energy. This means the importing area can avoid expending the energy to produce the imported commodities. The paper &quot;Shift in a National Virtual Energy Network&quot; examines how a region's energy haves and have-nots meet economic and energy needs by acknowledging energy is tightly wound around economic growth and demand.</p>
<p>The researchers are first to focus on energy use after the 2008 global financial crisis, seeing how economic desperation can have a big, not always obvious, impact on energy -- and the pollution and environmental degradation that can accompany its use.</p>
<p>&quot;China, like a lot of places across the globe, has an uneven distribution of energy resources, and China also is developing quickly,&quot; said the article's first author Zhenci Xu, an MSU-CSIS PhD student. &quot;We wanted to understand the true paths of energy use when economic growth kicks into gear after a financial crisis. Eventually, all the costs of energy use, including environmental damage and pollution, have to be accounted for, and current policies focus primarily on physical energy, not virtual energy.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers found a persistent flow of total virtual energy from energy-scare to energy-abundant provinces increased from 43.2% in 2007 to 47.5% in 2012. Following the framework of metacoupling (socioeconomic-environmental interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant places), they also discovered after the financial crisis, trade was taking place between distant provinces -- trade that came with energy's environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Abstract<br />
Energy is one of the most fundamental resources for humans and nature. Virtual energy transfer is considered one potential mechanism to alleviate energy shortages and support socioeconomic development in energy-scarce regions. However, little research has explored the change in flow pattern of national virtual energy trade since the 2008 global financial crisis. To fill this knowledge gap, we choose China’s interprovincial virtual energy transfer network as a demonstration, since China is the world's biggest energy consumer and features a starkly uneven spatial distribution of energy resources. Surprisingly, the total virtual energy transferred from energy-scarce to energy-abundant provinces increased from 43.2% to 47.5% from 2007 to 2012. In particular, the virtual oil which transferred from energy-scarce to energy-abundant provinces grew from 51.5% in 2007 to 54.0% in 2012. The percentage of provinces that transferred a greater amount of total virtual energy than was consumed internally increased from 23.3% in 2007 to 36.7% in 2012. Unexpectedly, the total virtual energy flowing from west China to east China was much greater than physical energy transferred through the West-To-East Electricity Transmission Project (WTEETP). This study suggests that it would be interesting to study patterns of interactions of virtual energy networks in other countries.</p>

<h2>mechanism of lifespan extension that links caloric restriction with immune system regulation.</h2>
<p>&quot;Modulating immune activity is an important aspect of dietary restriction,&quot; says Keith Blackwell, MD, PhD, Associate Research Director and Senior Investigator at Joslin, and Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, senior author on the paper. &quot;And it is important for longevity regulation and, in this context, increasing lifespan.&quot;</p>
<p>In this study, Dr. Blackwell and his team found that caloric restriction reduces levels of innate immunity by decreasing the activity of a regulatory protein called p38, triggering a chain reaction effect ending in a reduced immune response.</p>
<p>Innate immunity is like the security guard of the body, keeping an eye out for any unwelcome bacteria or viruses. If the innate immune system spots something, it activates an acute immune response. We need some degree of both kinds of immunity to stay healthy, but an overactive innate immune system -- which occurs more often as we age -- means constant low-grade inflammation, which can lead to myriad health issues.</p>
<p>&quot;[Before this study,] people looked what happens to immunity to aging in humans, but no one had ever looked in any organism at whether modulating immunity or its activities is involved in lifespan extension or can be beneficial as part of an anti-aging program,&quot; says Dr. Blackwell.</p>
<p>The research was conducted in the microscopic nematode worm C. elegans. The most fundamental genes and regulatory mechanisms found in these worms are typically simpler versions of those present in humans, making them a good model for studying human aging, genetics, and disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell and his team analyzed the levels of proteins and actions of genetic pathways during periods of caloric restriction. They were able to zero in on a particular genetic pathway that was regulated by the p38 protein. They saw that when p38 was totally inactive, caloric restriction failed and had no impact on innate immunity. When it was active, but at lower levels than normal, it triggered the genetic pathways that turned down the innate immune response to an optimal level.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the most surprising thing we found. The pathway was down regulated even though it was critical,&quot; says Dr. Blackwell.</p>
<p>That this immune-regulating response was activated by nutrients, rather than bacteria, was also surprising. This adds to a growing body of evidence tying metabolism to the immune system.</p>
<p>&quot;This is really an emerging field in mammals now, so called immunometabolism -- the idea that there are ancient links between metabolism and immunity,&quot; says Dr. Blackwell. &quot;We were able to show in this really very primitive immune system that it is regulated metabolically, and affects lifespan and health independently of an anti-pathogen function. That is when I started calling this a primitive immunometabolic pathway or an immunometabolic regulation.&quot;</p>
<p>After making this discovery, Dr. Blackwell was curious to know if the well-known longevity mechanism of reduced IGF1 signaling also acted on the immune system. For over 20 years, study after study in many different organisms have confirmed that lower levels of IGF1 signaling contributes to a longer lifespan. This is thought to be due to the activation of protective factors by a protein called FOXO (called DAF-16 in C. elegans).</p>
<p>In this new study, Dr. Blackwell and his team discovered that when IGF signaling was reduced in the worms, the chain reaction set off by the FOXO-like DAF-16 not only boosted protective mechanisms, but also led to a reduction of the worms' appetites. This naturally put the subjects in a state of caloric restriction.</p>
<p>&quot;This links the growth mechanism [of IGF1 signaling] to food consumption and food seeking behavior in a big way,&quot; says Dr. Blackwell.</p>
<p>A reduction in the activity of the FOXO-like gene seems to tell the worms that they are in a fasting-like state, and that nutrients may be scarce. This directs the worms to conserve energy, leading to a reduction in food intake. This self-imposed caloric restriction then leads to the lowering of the innate immune response. Dr. Blackwell plans to further study how the FOXO protein acts to suppress appetite, and to understand whether that might eventually lead to drug development.</p>
<p>The genes responsible for the phenomena observed in this study are conserved in humans. This opens up the possibility of human medical applications, from optimizing the immune system to drug development for appetite control.</p>
<p>&quot;The ultimate goal is to be able to manipulate healthy lifespan in a person,&quot; says Dr. Blackwell. &quot;Not to make people live to 120, 130, but to extend the period of healthy life. And chronic inflammation is a major factor in human aging. The hope is that some of the specific mechanisms could translate to optimizing immune function in humans during aging to enhance health in human lifespan.&quot;</p>

<p>Dietary restriction longevity requires modulation of nutrient-regulated immunity</p>
<p>•<br />
Nutrients activate the p38–ATF-7 immunometabolic pathway independently of mTORC1</p>
<p>•<br />
Insulin/IGF-1 signaling affects immunity and aging in part by curtailing food intake</p>
<p>•<br />
DAF-16/FOXO lowers food consumption, linking feeding and immunity to growth signals</p>
<p>Summary<br />
Chronic inflammation predisposes to aging-associated disease, but it is unknown whether immunity regulation might be important for extending healthy lifespan. Here we show that in C. elegans, dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan by modulating a conserved innate immunity pathway that is regulated by p38 signaling and the transcription factor ATF-7. Longevity from DR depends upon p38–ATF-7 immunity being intact but downregulated to a basal level. p38–ATF-7 immunity accelerates aging when hyperactive, influences lifespan independently of pathogen exposure, and is activated by nutrients independently of mTORC1, a major DR mediator. Longevity from reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling (rIIS) also involves p38–ATF-7 downregulation, with signals from DAF-16/FOXO reducing food intake. We conclude that p38–ATF-7 is an immunometabolic pathway that senses bacterial and nutrient signals, that immunity modulation is critical for DR, and that DAF-16/FOXO couples appetite to growth regulation. These conserved mechanisms may influence aging in more complex organisms.</p>
