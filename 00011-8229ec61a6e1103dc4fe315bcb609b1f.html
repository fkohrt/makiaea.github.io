<p><em>role of economics in analyzing the environment and sustainable development</em><br />
stephen polasky et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1901616116">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1901616116</a><br />
hainan case study</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with government authorities, the researchers looked at how their proposed approach, called the &quot;Ecological Development Strategy&quot; could work in Hainan Island, a rural, tropical region where expanding rubber plantations have driven extensive loss of natural forest and its vital benefits, such as soil retention and flood mitigation. Although the economy grew due to the plantations, intensive monocropping practices increased sediment runoff and channeled agricultural chemicals into surface waters. Forest recreation and tourism disappeared. Flooding was exacerbated by the area's loss of trees.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at land use and land cover changes in Hainan Island over a 19-year period of steady rubber plantation growth. Pairing that information with survey data from households, the team used the Natural Capital Project's InVEST modeling software to understand how changes in land use management could have garnered different results in natural forest or economic prosperity. Alongside the historical land data of almost two decades, the models helped researchers understand what could have happened if the land had never been developed for rubber plantations or if the plantations had been managed differently.</p>
<p>In particular, the researchers looked at one key land management change: a technique called intercropping that involves cultivating other valuable plants in the understory of a main crop. They found that rubber farmers who did this maintained the same production levels as monoculture plantations while significantly increasing soil retention, flood mitigation and nutrient retention. Perhaps most strikingly, farmers who took this approach doubled their incomes due to revenue from the additional crops. By diversifying their land, farmers also insured themselves against the risk of a single-crop's harvest failing or losing market value; key vulnerabilities of the monoculture system.</p>
<p>Broader applications</p>
<p>Central to the Chinese Ecological Development Strategy is a focus on targeted investments in nature. Identifying places like Hainan where policy and management decisions can support both the economy and environment is crucial to achieve the widespread impacts that China is looking for. According to the researchers, this study illustrates how regions can leverage natural resources to support economic growth without sacrificing ecosystem health or human well-being.</p>
<p>The challenges that Hainan rubber plantation farmers face in terms of relying on single crops are magnified at a global scale, where monocultures, such as soy, beef and palm oil, drive the vast majority of the global food market. Global climate insecurity, water contamination and species mass extinction are the result. The study's authors emphasize that the science and practices exist to help drive a shift away from monoculture systems worldwide, and economic incentives await those who do.</p>
<p>&quot;There doesn't necessarily need to be a trade-off,&quot; Daily said. &quot;You can have high value, high yielding production that secures farmers' livelihoods and supports the vital functioning of the natural ecosystem.&quot;</p>

<p><em>association between regional selenium status and reported outcome of covid-19 cases in china</em><br />
margaret p rayman et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa095">http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa095</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Selenium is an essential trace element obtained from the diet (i.e. fish, meat and cereals) which has been found to affect the severity of a number of viral diseases in animals and humans. For example selenium status in those with HIV has been shown to be an important factor in the progression of the virus to AIDs and death from the condition. China is known to have populations that have both the lowest and highest selenium status in the world, due to geographical differences in the soil which affects how much of the trace element gets into the food chain.<br />
Margaret Rayman, Professor of Nutritional Medicine at the University of Surrey, said: &quot;Given the history of viral infections associated with selenium deficiency, we wondered whether the appearance of COVID-19 in China could possibly be linked to the belt of selenium deficiency that runs from the north-east to the south-west of the country.&quot;<br />
Examining data from provinces and municipalities with more than 200 cases and cities with more than 40 cases, researchers found that areas with high levels of selenium were more likely to recover from the virus. For example, in the city of Enshi in Hubei Province, which has the highest selenium intake in China, the cure rate (percentage of COVID-19 patients declared 'cured') was almost three-times higher than the average for all the other cities in Hubei Province. By contrast, in Heilongjiang Province, where selenium intake is among the lowest in the world, the death rate from COVID-19 was almost five-times as high as the average of all the other provinces outside of Hubei.<br />
Most convincingly, the researchers found that the COVID-19 cure rate was significantly associated with selenium status, as measured by the amount of selenium in hair, in 17 cities outside of Hubei.<br />
Kate Bennett, a medical statistician at the University of Surrey, said; &quot;There is a significant link between selenium status and COVID-19 cure rate, however it is important not to overstate this finding; we have not been able to work with individual level data and have not been able to take account of other possible factors such as age and underlying disease.&quot;<br />
Ramy Saad, a doctor at Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, currently taking an MSc degree in Nutritional Medicine at the Department of Nutritional Sciences at Surrey, commented; &quot;The correlation we have identified is compelling, particularly given previous research on selenium and infectious diseases. As such, a careful and thorough assessment of the role selenium may play in COVID-19 is certainly justified and may help to guide ongoing public-health decisions.&quot;</li>

<p><em>“frozen evolution” of an rna virus suggests accidental release as a potential cause of arbovirus re-emergence</em><br />

<p>Livestock diseases like bluetongue virus (BTV) can have devastating economic and health consequences, but their origins can be difficult to establish. New research published in the open access journal <em>PLOS Biology</em> this week shows that the recent re-emergence of BTV in France could have been caused by human activities, based on the virus' unusual genetic makeup.<br />
Bluetongue virus, a pathogen that infects sheep and cattle, has caused billions of euros of damage to the European farming industry over the last two decades. In the new study, led by researchers at the University of Glasgow (UK) with a consortium of European collaborators, the authors compared genomes of the virus before and after it re-emerged in France in 2015. BTV first arrived in Europe in 2006 from unknown sources. It was controlled through mass vaccination by 2010, and no cases were reported until it re-emerged in 2015. The authors' genome analyses revealed that during both the 2006 and 2015 outbreaks, BTV accumulated novel mutations in a manner expected for a rapidly evolving virus. During the period in between the two outbreaks, however, the researchers noted a curious lack of mutations, indicating that the virus was likely not circulating during this period. The genetic similarity between the original and re-emergent viruses suggests that the 2015 outbreak was caused by infectious material that somehow arose from the first outbreak.<br />
Virus persistence over multiple years in the absence of genetic changes would upset our understanding of virus biology. A more plausible scenario, the authors argue, is that the virus resurfaced after being stored in frozen samples. And since artificial insemination and embryo transfer are widely used in the livestock industry, they say, this transmission mechanism should be evaluated by future work.<br />
Prof. Massimo Palmarini, one of the senior authors of the study says: &quot;In order to survive, to be transmitted and to find new hosts, viruses need to replicate. New mutations are an inevitable consequence of this, so viruses can't remain 'frozen in time'. While there is still lots for us to learn about virus biology, the most plausible explanation for our findings is that exposure to infectious material, stored from the earlier outbreak, caused the most recent emergence of this virus in Europe.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.</p>

<p><em>analysis of official deceased organ donation data casts doubt on the credibility of china’s organ transplant reform</em><br />
matthew p. robertson et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6">http://https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6</a></p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Background<br />
Since 2010 the People’s Republic of China has been engaged in an effort to reform its system of organ transplantation by developing a voluntary organ donation and allocation infrastructure. This has required a shift in the procurement of organs sourced from China’s prison and security apparatus to hospital-based voluntary donors declared dead by neurological and/or circulatory criteria. Chinese officials announced that from January 1, 2015, hospital-based donors would be the sole source of organs. This paper examines the availability, transparency, integrity, and consistency of China’s official transplant data.</p>
<p>Methods<br />
Forensic statistical methods were used to examine key deceased organ donation datasets from 2010 to 2018. Two central-level datasets — published by the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) and the Red Cross Society of China — are tested for evidence of manipulation, including conformance to simple mathematical formulae, arbitrary internal ratios, the presence of anomalous data artefacts, and cross-consistency. Provincial-level data in five regions are tested for coherence, consistency, and plausibility, and individual hospital data in those provinces are examined for consistency with provincial-level data.</p>
<p>Results<br />
COTRS data conforms almost precisely to a mathematical formula (which first appeared to be a general quadratic, but with further confirmatory data was discovered to be a simpler one-parameter quadratic) while Central Red Cross data mirrors it, albeit imperfectly. The analysis of both datasets suggests human-directed data manufacture and manipulation. Contradictory, implausible, or anomalous data artefacts were found in five provincial datasets, suggesting that these data may have been manipulated to enforce conformity with central quotas. A number of the distinctive features of China’s current organ procurement and allocation system are discussed, including apparent misclassification of nonvoluntary donors as voluntary.</p>
<p>Conclusion<br />
A variety of evidence points to what the authors believe can only be plausibly explained by systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets in China. Some apparently nonvoluntary donors also appear to be misclassified as voluntary. This takes place alongside genuine voluntary organ transplant activity, which is often incentivized by large cash payments. These findings are relevant for international interactions with China’s organ transplantation system.</p>

<p>“Earlier this year, David Spiegelhalter, a former president of the Royal Statistical Society, reviewed the core analysis, <a href="https://chinatribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Commentary-on-Robertson-et-al-Spiegelhalter.pdf">commenting</a> that “the anomalies in the data examined follow a systematic and surprising pattern—the close agreement of the numbers of donors and transplants with a quadratic function is remarkable and is in sharp contrast to other countries who have increased their activity over this period. I cannot think of any good reason for such a quadratic trend arising naturally.”</p>

<li><em>abstract</em> Plague is a pandemic human invasive disease caused by the bacterial agent Yersinia pestis. We here report a comparison of 17 whole genomes of Y. pestis isolates from global sources. We also screened a global collection of 286 Y. pestis isolates for 933 SNPs using Sequenom MassArray SNP typing. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on this sequence variation dataset, assigned isolates to populations based on maximum parsimony and, from these results, made inferences regarding historical transmission routes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that Y. pestis evolved in or near China and spread through multiple radiations to Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, leading to country-specific lineages that can be traced by lineage-specific SNPs. All 626 current isolates from the United States reflect one radiation, and 82 isolates from Madagascar represent a second radiation. Subsequent local microevolution of Y. pestis is marked by sequential, geographically specific SNPs.</li>

<li><em>abstract</em> Aerosolized pathogens are a leading cause of respiratory infection and transmission. Currently used protective measures pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and transmission. Here, we report the development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in obtaining a broad-spectrum, airborne pathogen prevention device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory diseases.</li>

<p><em>china’s reefer cargo crisis worsens as carriers plan to abandon boxes</em><br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>Japanese carrier ONE has joined several of its liner peers in imposing a congestion surcharge on reefer containers destined for major Chinese ports.<br />
Moreover, some carriers are preparing to declare force majeure and leave refrigerated containers at alternative ports.<br />
With the coronavirus outbreak showing no signs of abating in China and still severely restricting landside operations at the ports of Shanghai, Ningbo and Xingang, reefer plug-in points are in extremely short supply, obliging carriers to discharge temperature-controlled boxes at other ports.<br />
ONE has told customers it would apply a surcharge of $1,000 per reefer container, with immediate effect, “to cover additional costs related to the unexpected but necessary arrangement of shipments, and associated plug-in charges and monitoring fees”.</p>
<p>The carrier also said it may need to “adjust the original transport plan”, which could result “in the discharge of reefer containers at an alternative port without prior notice”.<br />
ONE said it would endeavour to arrange relay of the reefer boxes to intended destinations, “subject to reefer plug availability”. However, it would be encouraging customers to consider a change of destination, “especially for time-sensitive cargo such as fresh, chilled commodities”.<br />
Israeli carrier Zim and others have also announced immediate surcharges of $1,000, while CMA CGM  will surcharge its customers $1,250 per reefer container. e,<br />
MSC said it was invoking clause 19 of its bill of lading, which potentially gives it the right to leave goods at “any place or port which the carrier may deem safe and convenient”, and to receive full freight with any additional costs incurred for the shipper’s account.<br />
The Loadstar understands that other carriers could follow MSC’s example if the crisis continues.<br />
Meanwhile, insurers are bracing themselves for claims for spoiled contents in containers stuck on terminals in Asia for several weeks.<br />
One marine cargo insurer source told The Loadstar he expected “an avalanche” of claims following the massive supply chain disruption resulting from the virus outbreak, and that, with the vast growth in reefer imports into China, potential claims “could be massive”.<br />
“Unfortunately it is not just about plugging the boxes in,” he said. “A lot of the contents of reefer boxes have a shelf life and the goods will end up being destroyed and a total loss. We know from previous experience that claims can run into tens of thousands of dollars per single unit.”<br />
<a href="https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/plugins/adrotate-pro/adrotate-out.php?track=NTU5LDE0NCwwLGh0dHBzOi8vZWN1MzYwLmVjdXdvcmxkd2lkZS5jb20vIy9sb2dpbg=">￼<br />
</a>Indeed, the Swedish Club agreed that damage to reefer container cargo was “both frequent and costly”, and because the cargo was intended for human consumption, “even minor changes in quality may cause authorities to order the complete destruction of the cargo”.</p>

<li><em>abstract</em> Since December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern.1 Family clusters of infected individuals have been reported, and this phenomenon could present a serious threat to public health if not strictly controlled. In a previously reported family cluster, most infected individuals had clinical symptoms, decreased lymphocyte counts, and abnormal chest CT images, and were positive for the virus on quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.2,  3 However, some of the family members had abnormal chest CT images and positive qRT-PCR results without any clinical symptoms.3 Here, we report the clinical characteristics of a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this family of three, one 35-year-old man (patient 1) had clinical symptoms, a decreased lymphocyte count, abnormal chest CT images, and a positive result on qRT-PCR. By contrast, the other two family members—a 33-year-old woman (patient 2) and a 3-year-old boy (patient 3)—were both asymptomatic, with normal lymphocyte counts and chest CT images but positive qRT-PCR results (figure).</li>

<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for epidemiology, vaccine development, and antibody-based drug therapy. However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.</li>

<strong>•    START + between 2-5 weeks</strong>: a symptomatic patient is recorded by healthcare system. (others may have had it, but they didn’t stand out enough to be discussed in published investigations about the outbreak.)<br />
<strong>•    START + between 5-8 weeks</strong>: there is a large enough influx of serious patients that the outbreak stands out from normal flu/cold season. (Doctors start messaging each other to be careful)<br />
<strong>•    START + between 7-10 weeks</strong>: first death attributed to virus (there could have been others earlier mis-identified as cold/flu or not reported - but this lag from outbreak to death seems consistent with progression in international cases.)<br />
<strong>•    START + between 9-12 weeks:</strong> Looming healthcare disaster is apparent enough to call for massive mitigation and containment efforts.<br />
<strong>•    START + between 11-14 weeks: Explosion of serious/critical cases.</strong><br />
There are some very rational/logical reasons to expect this timeline <strong>will not</strong> be repeated exactly in other cities.<br />
1    Active efforts to spot and quarantine cases to slow the spread<br />
2    The initial outbreak in Wuhan (early-mid Nov) can be assumed to be more intense because of local sanitary conditions and lack of vigilance. Wuhan began with high-density community transmission from day 1... (Diamond Princess is probably the only place where it could/would have spread faster)<br />
That said, it seems like a lot of communities worldwide (i.e. Indonesia or Cambodia) would be at high risk of this happening there. (They could actually be more prone to high density transmission...)<br />
It also seems unlikely for an outbreak to move any faster than this timeline.<br />
Interestingly, Singapore is at START + 4.5 weeks (first known case arrived Jan 20th). If they were not actively monitoring I don’t believe they’d have noticed the unusual spike in in cases yet (but would be very close with 7 serious/critical pneumonia cases at one point).</p>

<p><em>the effects of corrective information about disease epidemics and outbreaks: evidence from zika and yellow fever in brazil</em><br />

<p>“It is essential to evaluate public health messaging and information campaigns,” said co-author Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth. “Our results indicate that efforts to correct misperceptions about emerging diseases like Zika may not be as effective as we might hope.”<br />
The study was based on a nationally representative survey conducted in Brazil in 2017 and online survey experiments conducted there in 2017 (not long after the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic) and in 2018 (just after an unusually severe yellow fever outbreak). Using survey data, the team first demonstrated the prevalence of misperceptions among Brazilians about whether Zika can be transmitted through sexual contact (true) or casual contact (false).<br />
The researchers then conducted three preregistered experiments testing the effectiveness of information provided by public health officials to dispel myths about Zika and yellow fever. These studies, which were conducted online among Brazilian adults, showed that corrective information about Zika not only failed to reduce misperceptions but also frequently reduced the accuracy of other beliefs people held about the disease (a finding that was replicated in both the 2017 and 2018 data).<br />
The researchers found that corrective information about yellow fever was more effective than the material about Zika. However, exposure to this information did not increase support for public policies aimed at preventing the spread of either disease nor did it change people’s intentions to engage in preventive behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Disease epidemics and outbreaks often generate conspiracy theories and misperceptions that mislead people about the risks they face and how best to protect themselves. We investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at combating false and unsupported information about the Zika epidemic and subsequent yellow fever outbreak in Brazil. Results from a nationally representative survey show that conspiracy theories and other misperceptions about Zika are widely believed. Moreover, results from three preregistered survey experiments suggest that efforts to counter misperceptions about diseases during epidemics and outbreaks may not always be effective. We find that corrective information not only fails to reduce targeted Zika misperceptions but also reduces the accuracy of other beliefs about the disease. In addition, although corrective information about the better-known threat from yellow fever was more effective, none of these corrections affected support for vector control policies or intentions to engage in preventive behavior.</p>

<p>In late January, a group of patients in the Starnberg area near Munich became Germany’s first group of epidemiologically linked cases of COVID-19. Nine patients from this ‘Munich cluster’ subsequently received treatment at München Klinik Schwabing. “At that point time, we really knew very little about the novel coronavirus which we now refer to as SARS-CoV-2,” says one of the study’s lead authors, Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology on Campus Charité Mitte. He adds: “Our decision to study these nine cases very closely throughout the course of their illness resulted in the discovery of many important details about this new virus.”<br />
“The patients treated at our hospital were all young to middle-aged. Their symptoms were generally mild and included flu-like symptoms like cough, fever and a loss of taste and smell,” explains the other lead author, Prof. Dr. Clemens Wendtner, Head of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at München Klinik Schwabing, a teaching hospital of LMU Munich. “In terms of scientific significance, our study benefited from the fact that all of the cases were linked to an index case, meaning they were not simply studied based on the presence of certain symptoms. In addition to getting a good picture of how this virus behaves, this also enabled us to gain other important insights, including on viral transmission.”<br />
All nine patients underwent daily testing using both nasopharyngeal (nose and throat) swabs and sputum samples. Testing continued throughout the course of their illness and up to 28 days after the initial onset of symptoms. The researchers also collected stool, blood and urine samples whenever possible or practical. All of the samples collected were then tested for SARS-CoV-2 by two separate laboratories working independently of each other: the Institute of Virology on Campus Charité Mitte in Berlin and the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, an institution which forms part of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).<br />
According to the researchers’ observations, all COVID-19 patients showed a high rate of viral replication and shedding in the throat during the first week of symptoms. Sputum samples also showed high levels of viral RNA (genetic information). Infectious viral particles were isolated from both pharyngeal (throat) swabs and sputum samples. “This means that the novel coronavirus does not have to travel to the lungs to replicate. It can replicate while still in the throat, which means it is very easy to transmit,” explains Prof. Drosten, who is also affiliated with the DZIF, and is a professor at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH). Due to genetic similarities between the new virus and the original SARS virus, the researchers initially assumed that, just like the SARS virus, the novel coronavirus would predominantly target the lungs — thus making human-to-human transmission more difficult. “However, our research involving the Munich cluster showed that the new SARS coronavirus differs quite considerably in terms of its preferential target tissue,” says the virologist, and adds: “Naturally, this has enormous consequences for both viral transmission and spread, which is why we decided to publish our initial findings in early February.”<br />
In most cases, viral load decreased significantly during the first week of symptoms. While viral shedding in the lungs also decreased, this decline happened later than in the throat. The researchers were no longer able to obtain infectious virus particles from day 8 after the initial onset of symptoms. However, levels of viral RNA remained high in both the throat and lungs. The researchers found that samples with fewer than 100,000 copies of viral RNA no longer contained any infectious viral particles. This allowed the researchers to draw two conclusions: “A high viral load in the throat at the very onset of symptoms suggests that individuals with COVID-19 are infectious very early on, potentially before they are even aware of being ill,” explains Colonel PD Dr. Roman Wölfel, Director of the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology and one of the study’s first authors. “At the same time, the infectiousness of COVID-19 patients appears to be linked to viral load in the throat and lungs. In hospitals with limited bed capacity and the resultant pressure to expedite patient discharge, this is an important factor when it comes to deciding the earliest point at which a patient can be safely discharged.” Based on these data, the study’s authors suggest that COVID-19 patients with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies in their sputum sample on day 10 of symptoms could be discharged into home-based isolation.<br />
The researchers’ work also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the researchers were unable to isolate any infectious virus from patients’ stool samples. None of the blood and urine samples tested positive for the virus. Serum samples were also tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Half of the patients tested had developed antibodies by day 7 following symptom onset; antibodies were detected in all patients after two weeks. The onset of antibody production coincided with a gradual decrease in viral load.<br />
The Munich- and Berlin-based research groups plan to conduct additional research on the development of long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, both within the first German cluster and in other patients. This type of research will also play an important role in the development of vaccines.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory tract infection that emerged in late 20191,2. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.</p>

<li>The number of confirmed cases for the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 officially issued by countries and widely commented on by national and international media outlets dramatically understates the true number of infections, a recent report from the University of Göttingen suggests. Dr Christian Bommer and Professor Sebastian Vollmer from Göttingen University have used estimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death from a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records.<br />
Their data shows that countries have only discovered on average about 6% of coronavirus infections and the true number of infected people worldwide may already have reached several tens of millions. Insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some European countries, such as Italy and Spain, are experiencing much higher casualty numbers (relative to reported confirmed cases) than Germany, which has detected an estimated 15.6% of infections compared to only 3.5% in Italy or 1.7% in Spain. Detection rates are even lower in the United States (1.6%) and the United Kingdom (1.2%) -- two countries that have received widespread criticism from public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.<br />
In sharp contrast to this, South Korea appears to have discovered almost half of all its SARS-CoV-2 infections. The authors estimate that on 31 March 2020, Germany had 460,000 infections. Based on the same method, they calculate that the United States had more than ten million, Spain more than five million, Italy around three million and the United Kingdom around two million infections. On the same day the Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were less than 900,000 confirmed cases, meaning that the vast majority of infections were undetected.<br />
Sebastian Vollmer, Professor of Development Economics at the University of Göttingen, says, &quot;These results mean that governments and policy-makers need to exercise extreme caution when interpreting case numbers for planning purposes. Such extreme differences in the amount and quality of testing carried out in different countries mean that official case records are largely uninformative and do not provide helpful information.&quot; Christian Bommer adds: &quot;Major improvements in the ability of countries to detect new infections and contain the virus are urgently needed.&quot;</li>

<p>Researchers in China and the US find that the virus that causes Covid-19 can destroy the T cells that are supposed to protect the body from harmful invaders</p>
<p>One doctor said concern is growing in medical circles that effect could be similar to HIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A doctor who works in a public hospital treating Covid-19 patients in Beijing said the discovery added another piece of evidence to a growing concern in medical circles that the coronavirus could sometimes behave like some of the most notorious viruses that directly attack the human immune system.<br />
“More and more people compare it to HIV,” said the doctor who requested not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.<br />
In February, Chen Yongwen and his colleagues at the PLA’s Institute of Immunology released a clinical report warning that the number of T cells could drop significantly in Covid-19 patients, especially when they were elderly or required treatment in intensive care units. The lower the T cell count, the higher the risk of death.</p>
<p>This observation was later confirmed by autopsy examinations on more than 20 patients, whose immune systems were almost completely destroyed, according to mainland media reports.</p>
<p>Doctors who had seen the bodies said the damage to the internal organs was similar to a combination of Sars and Aids.<br />
The gene behind the fusion function in Sars-CoV-2 was not found in other coronaviruses in human or animals.<br />
But some deadly human viruses such as Aids and Ebola have similar sequences, prompting speculation that the novel coronavirus might have been spreading quietly in human societies for a long time before causing this pandemic.</p>
<p>But there was one major difference between Sars-CoV-2 and HIV, according to the new study.<br />
HIV can replicate in the T cells and turn them into factories to generate more copies to infect other cells.<br />
But Lu and Jiang did not observe any growth of the coronavirus after it entered the T-cells, suggesting that the virus and T-cells might end up dying together.<br />
The study gives rise to some new questions. For instance, the coronavirus can exist for weeks on some patients without causing any symptoms. How it interacted with the T cells in these patients remained unclear.<br />
Some critically ill patients also experienced cytokine storms, where the immune system overreacts and attacks healthy cells.<br />
But why and how the coronavirus triggers that effect remains poorly understood.</p>

<p><em>SARS-CoV-2 infects T lymphocytes through its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion</em><br />

<li>COVID-19, the novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and outbroken at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR1">24</a> becomes a worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and has 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host entry receptor.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR2">25</a> The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include pneumonia, diarrhea, dyspnea, and multiple organ failure. Interestingly, lymphocytopenia, as a diagnostic indicator, is common in COVID-19 patients. Xiong et al. found upregulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and p53 pathways in PBMC of COVID-19 patients.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR3">26</a> Some studies reported that lymphocytopenia might be related to mortality, especially in patients with low levels of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR4">27</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR5">28</a> Lymphocytopenia was also found in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. MERS-CoV can directly infect human primary T lymphocytes and induce T-cell apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, but it cannot replicate in T lymphocytes.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6">29</a> However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also infect T cells, resulting in lymphocytopenia.<br />
To address this question, we evaluated the susceptibility of T lymphocytes to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To accomplish this, pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were packaged based on methods described previously.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR7">30</a> The pseudoviruses could infect permissive cells (293T/ACE2 and Huh7 cells) expressing the ACE2 receptor, but could not infect nonpermissive cells (HeLa cells) (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1a</a>). We used pseudovirus with equal infectivity to 293T/ACE2 cells (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1c</a>) to infect two T lymphocyte cell lines, MT-2 and A3.01, with very low, or close to negative, expression level of hACE2 mRNA (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1b</a>). Surprisingly, over several replicates, we saw that the T-cell lines were significantly more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with SARS-CoV (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1c</a>). In other words, these results tell us that T lymphocytes may be more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and less permissive for SARS-CoV infection, similar to the findings in a previous study.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6">29</a> Therefore, it is plausible that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might mediate potent infectivity, even on cells expressing low hACE2, which would, in turn, explain why the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is so high. It is also possible that other receptors mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into T cells, such as CD147, present on the surface of T lymohocytes,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR8">31</a> which was recently reported to be a novel invasive route for SARS-CoV-2.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR9">32</a><br />

To assess if SARS-CoV-2 enters T lymphocytes through non-receptor-mediated endocytosis, we used EK1 peptide which has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) mediated cell–cell fusion and pseudovirus infection.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR7">30</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR10">33</a> Specifically, it inhibits receptor-mediated infection by interacting with HR1 to block the formation of the six-helix bundle (6-HB), further inhibiting fusion between viral and target cell membranes. We found that the EK1 peptide had significant inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses on MT-2 cells (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1d</a>), suggesting that virus entry depends on receptor-mediated fusion. However, only a high concentration (40 μM) of EK1 had inhibitory activity on MT-2 cells. Meanwhile, the IC50 value of EK1 was 2.38 μM on 293T/ACE2 cells.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR10">33</a> These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can also enter T lymphocytes through the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. To clarify, we performed a SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell–cell fusion assay according to previous studies.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR7">30</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR10">33</a> After 48 h of coculture, 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein fused with MT-2 cells. Compared with unfused cells, the fused cells clustered together and appeared as a large faint green fluorescent mass. In contrast, no fused cells were found in the SARS-CoV coculture (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1e</a>). Therefore, it can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 might infect T cells through S protein-mediated membrane fusion.<br />
To further determine the susceptibility of MT-2 cells to live virus, we used SARS-CoV-2 to infect MT-2 cells and detected the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) in the cells as reported previously.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6">29</a> Notably, several MT-2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1f</a>). Quantitatively, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 NP-positive MT-2 cells was 23.11% higher than that of uninfected cells at 24 h post infection, which is about 4.6-fold of the portion at 1 h (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1f</a>). This result means that the virus penetrated MT-2 cells at 24 h and infected them.<br />
Given that MERS-CoV can efficiently infect, but not replicate, in T lymphocytes,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6">29</a> we further detected the number of viral genome copies at different time points post infection to explore the replication characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in MT-2 cells. Similar to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 failed to replicate in MT-2 cells (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1g</a>). The number of viral genome copies at 6 h was significantly higher than other time points in the cell lysate, but always remained steady at all time points in the supernatants. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may enter MT-2 cells at 6 h post infection, but does not replicate, and then the viral RNA degrade. In supernatants, the detected viral copies might be the background of the residual virions, similar to the results of the previous MERS-CoV study (Fig. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1">1g</a>).<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6">29</a><br />
Based on the results of pseudovirus and live virus infection, here we proved that (1) SARS-CoV-2 could infect T cells, (2) SARS-CoV-2 infected T cells through receptor-dependent, S protein-mediated membrane fusion, and (3) infection could be inhibited by EK1 peptide. However, we observed a very low expression level of hACE2 in T cells; therefore, we further proposed that a novel receptor might mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into T cells. Similar to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection of T cells is abortive. A recent study reported that viral reads barely displayed in PBMC samples from COVID-19 patients through transcriptome sequencing of RNAs. Thus, it was inferred that SARS-CoV-2 could not infect PBMCs. However, the transcriptomic characteristics of PBMCs were detected and analyzed from three patients. Two SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in one patient’s PBMCs, and zero reads in another.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR3">26</a> This result could be attributed to nonproductive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in T lymphocytes, with little viral genome in PBMCs possibly degrading in the sample collection and RNA extraction process. Thus, the questions of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in primary T cells and whether the infection induces apoptosis in T cells still need further research, potentially evoking new ideas about pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.</li>

<p><em>sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 is an interferon-stimulated gene in human airway epithelial cells and is detected in specific cell subsets across tissues</em><br />
ziegler et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.035</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not long after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began, scientists discovered that the viral &quot;spike&quot; protein binds to a receptor on human cells known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Another human protein, an enzyme called TMPRSS2, helps to activate the coronavirus spike protein, to allow for cell entry. The combined binding and activation allows the virus to get into host cells.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as we realized that the role of these proteins had been biochemically confirmed, we started looking to see where those genes were in our existing datasets,&quot; Ordovas-Montanes says. &quot;We were really in a good position to start to investigate which are the cells that this virus might actually target.&quot;<br />
Shalek's lab, and many other labs around the world, have performed large-scale studies of tens of thousands of human, nonhuman primate, and mouse cells, in which they use single-cell RNA sequencing technology to determine which genes are turned on in a given cell type. Since last year, Nyquist has been building a database with partners at the Broad Institute to store a huge collection of these datasets in one place, allowing researchers to study potential roles for particular cells in a variety of infectious diseases.<br />
Much of the data came from labs that belong to the Human Cell Atlas project, whose goal is to catalog the distinctive patterns of gene activity for every cell type in the human body. The datasets that the MIT team used for this study included hundreds of cell types from the lungs, nasal passages, and intestine. The researchers chose those organs for the Covid-19 study because previous evidence had indicated that the virus can infect each of them. They then compared their results to cell types from unaffected organs.<br />
&quot;Because we have this incredible repository of information, we were able to begin to look at what would be likely target cells for infection,&quot; Shalek says. &quot;Even though these datasets weren't designed specifically to study Covid, it's hopefully given us a jump start on identifying some of the things that might be relevant there.&quot;<br />
In the nasal passages, the researchers found that goblet secretory cells, which produce mucus, express RNAs for both of the proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect cells. In the lungs, they found the RNAs for these proteins mainly in cells called type II pneumocytes. These cells line the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs and are responsible for keeping them open.</p>
<p>In the intestine, they found that cells called absorptive enterocytes, which are responsible for the absorption of some nutrients, express the RNAs for these two proteins more than any other intestinal cell type.<br />
&quot;This may not be the full story, but it definitely paints a much more precise picture than where the field stood before,&quot; Ordovas-Montanes says. &quot;Now we can say with some level of confidence that these receptors are expressed on these specific cells in these tissues.&quot;<br />
<strong>Fighting infection</strong><br />
In their data, the researchers also saw a surprising phenomenon -- expression of the ACE2 gene appeared to be correlated with activation of genes that are known to be turned on by interferon, a protein that the body produces in response to viral infection. To explore this further, the researchers performed new experiments in which they treated cells that line the airway with interferon, and they discovered that the treatment did indeed turn on the ACE2 gene.<br />
Interferon helps to fight off infection by interfering with viral replication and helping to activate immune cells. It also turns on a distinctive set of genes that help cells fight off infection. Previous studies have suggested that ACE2 plays a role in helping lung cells to tolerate damage, but this is the first time that ACE2 has been connected with the interferon response.<br />
The finding suggests that coronaviruses may have evolved to take advantage of host cells' natural defenses, hijacking some proteins for their own use.<br />
&quot;This isn't the only example of that,&quot; Ordovas-Montanes says. &quot;There are other examples of coronaviruses and other viruses that actually target interferon-stimulated genes as ways of getting into cells. In a way, it's the most reliable response of the host.&quot;<br />
Because interferon has so many beneficial effects against viral infection, it is sometimes used to treat infections such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The findings of the MIT team suggest that interferon's potential role in fighting Covid-19 may be complex. On one hand, it can stimulate genes that fight off infection or help cells survive damage, but on the other hand, it may provide extra targets that help the virus infect more cells.<br />
&quot;It's hard to make any broad conclusions about the role of interferon against this virus. The only way we'll begin to understand that is through carefully controlled clinical trials,&quot; Shalek says. &quot;What we are trying to do is put information out there, because there are so many rapid clinical responses that people are making. We're trying to make them aware of things that might be relevant.&quot;</p>

<p>“You can tell you’ve found a really interesting question when no one wants you to answer it.”  <br />
Over the past several months thousands of humans have lost their lives since COVID-19 kicked-off its killing spree in Wuhan, and barring an absolute miracle millions more all across the planet will join them in the months to come. Comparisons to the pandemic caused by the Spanish Flu earlier in the twentieth century abound, however one thing is clear: Whether due to globalization or to internal differences between the viruses, while the Spanish Flu was a slow-moving miasma that took years to unfurl across the globe, the Wuhan strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, has blanketed the entire planet in just a few months.<br />
Factories all across the planet have ground to a halt, stores are shuttered, tens of millions are quarantined across multiple continents, and supply chains are disintegrating.<br />
And oddly, even though <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/03/19/china-owns-nature-magazines-ass-debunking-the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2-claiming-covid-19-wasnt-from-a-lab/">there is nothing even beginning to approach conclusive evidence</a> that COVID-19 was a naturally emergent strain that made its way out of an intermediate animal host and into humans, the general consensus in the media and the public seems to be that exploring its origins is something only done by people who’ve yet to buy that the Earth is in fact round and that we actually did land on the moon. And everyone seems to be okay with the fact that the scientists crowing the loudest about a natural origin, are the ones directly involved with the type of research that likely spawned this virus: <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">Gain-of-function, or “dual-use” research that meant to push Nature past her limits</a>, so that humans can harness her to create monsters that would never occur naturally.<br />
Why the concentrated push to marginalize anyone asking for conclusive proof about where COVID-19 came from? Who benefits?<br />
“We modified our science team to remove ethical restraints.”<br />
Back in 1977 a very peculiar disease began to sweep across Russia, and once scientists had isolated it they discovered it was a rather unique strain of the H1N1 Swine Flu. In the years that followed genetic analysis looking to determine where it might’ve come from found something rather odd: It was very similar to strains of H1N1 that hadn’t been in circulation for decades, and seemed to be the product of <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/4/e01013-15">“sequential passage in an animal reservoir”</a> which was determined by its vast genetic distance from any other present strain of flu, just like COVID-19 which also appears so distant from any related coronavirus that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y">it’s been placed in its own clade</a>, an isolated branch way out on its own in the viral family tree – meaning it’s the lone example of its kind, and doesn’t clump together with all the other known coronaviruses.<br />
At the time, the Soviet Union was employing tens of thousands of scientists designing every possible flavor of biological weapon, a rabidly immoral weapons program with a spotty safety record – pathogens were known to leak out of Soviet labs almost regularly. Which has happened at plenty of biological weapons labs since, but especially China’s, which have leaked the SARS virus four times just in recent years. And Soviet scientists were reported to bring dead research animals home for dinner, meat wasn’t exactly readily available in the USSR at that time, which parallels the reports of scientists in Wuhan <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">smuggling dead lab animals out</a> to sell for a few extra bucks on the street.<br />
<a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/4/e01013-15">Earlier in the 70’s</a> prior to the leak, “the swine flu scare… [had] prompted the international community to reexamine their stocks of the latest previously circulating H1N1 strains to attempt to develop a vaccine,” which was seen to have increased the odds that someone, somewhere would make a mistake and leak an altered strain of the flu out of their lab. This increased pace of research mirrors recent times, when scientists have been investigating and trying to understand the supposedly impending threat posed by coronaviruses for years, capturing as many unique strains from the wild as they could, and <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502">mixing and matching their genomes in the lab</a>.<br />
And so increased research into the H1N1 Swine Flu back in the 70’s eventually increased the odds that a mistake would happen enough that one did, and a leak occurred. Just as our current pandemic was preceded not only by years of research into coronaviruses everywhere from UNC to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Disease Engineering Technical Research Center, and have been accelerated by a massive international conference meant to study a potential pandemic caused by a hyper-virulent strain of coronavirus, Johns Hopkins’ Event 201. This was funded primarily by the World Economic Forum as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and notably occurred in October 2019, just weeks before the start of this outbreak of COVID-19.<br />
If leading up to 1977, the fact that increased research into strains of the flu were seen to increase the odds that an accidental leak would occur, why isn’t the same logic being applied to our pandemic today? Why is almost everyone today assuming that the increased pace of research means scientists in fact anticipated this outbreak instead of causing it?<br />
Wouldn’t an increased pace of research also increase the odds that a leak of a lab-modified coronavirus would occur just like an increased pace of research precipitated the leak of the H1N1 Swine Flu back then?<br />
“You give a monkey a stick, inevitably he’ll beat another monkey to death with it”<br />
Scientists have been directly altering and modifying viral genomes for at least the past twenty years, doing everything from building complete viruses from scratch, to tweaking them and then passing them through series of animal hosts to artificially speed selection and evolution along so that they’re able have as many different strains of virus with as many novel features as possible to tinker with.<br />
However most of this work didn’t really raise too many eyebrows, until about ten years ago when scientists in Stony Brook, NY – not coincidentally also the first place to build a DNA-virus from scratch – took the H5N1 Bird Flu, tweaked its genome in two places, and then <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723413">passed it through a series of ferret hosts</a> in the lab until it became airborne. This sort of research, a minor alteration and then passage through ferrets, did two things: Resulted in a virus that would look natural and wouldn’t appear to have been directly genetically altered, and also created a virus that was way out on its own branch of the viral family tree since those sequential passages added generations far faster than they’d naturally occur in the wild. If that sounds familiar, maybe that’s because those traits are also exactly what’s found with COVID-19.<br />
And as far back as 2015, Chinese labs were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCOx-hewCcc&amp;feature=youtu.be">reported to have been involved with dual-use gain-of-function research</a> after the Chinese military <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/08/chinas-military-pursuing-biotech/159167/">made a massive push</a> to expand their biotechnological capabilities, swapping around viral genomes in the lab to try to create the most virulent strain possible. Additionally, studies <a href="https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell-host-microbe/PDFs/chom_2285_preproof.pdf">examining COVID-19’s infectivity in ferrets</a> found that it spreads readily among them, and also appears airborne in that animal model, lending support to the idea that ferrets were used for serial passage. Further support for possibility that serial passage through lab animals played a role in the creation of COVID-19 <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.025080v1.full.pdf+html">comes from an April 2020 pre-print</a>, which found that coronaviruses that target the ACE2 receptor bind with ferrets cells more tightly than any other species except the tree shrew, which only scored about 2% higher. Tree shrews have also been used for serial viral passage, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6177411/">were promoted in a 2018 paper out of China</a> as a preferable host for laboratory serial passage since they’re cheaper, smaller, easier to handle, and closer to humans evolutionarily and physiologically than ferrets.  Pangolins however, formed a much weaker bond than either, and were clustered way down on the list along with a handful of other much more unlikely intermediate animal hosts.<br />
Quite curiously, one of the scientists supporting this troubling research in an article that noted the virus <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/11/scientists-brace-media-storm-around-controversial-flu-studies">“could change history if it was ever set free”</a> appeared <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/coronavirus-joe-rogan-experience-interview-michael-osterhold-covid-19-episode/">on Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2020</a> a few weeks into the current pandemic, claiming that COVID-19 was definitely natural and making no mention of this animal-based dual-use gain-of-function research at all. Odd, right? It’s almost like <a href="https://twitter.com/mtosterholm?lang=en">Michael Osterholm</a>, whose entire career <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6069/662">rests on advancing gain-of-function of research</a>, might want to whitewash what’s really going on? Did that sunshine tickle when it was being blown up your ass, Joe?<br />
Osterholm failed to tell the story of this genetically modified H5N1 Bird Flu, which was turned into a virus that <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2011/12/31/carl-zimmer-should-scientists-self-censor-their-h5n1-research/">“could make the deadly 1918 pandemic look like a pesky cold.”</a> This result was so troubling that the NIH, which had funded the research, tried to make sure that the it would only be published after enough details were taken out to make replication of the experiment tough to perform. However one of the virologists involved in the research thought these restrictions were a bit silly, since the gist of the experiment was enough to allow anyone with enough money to replicate them without a problem. Especially researchers who were already familiar with manipulating bat coronaviruses, <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">two of whom learned how to do exactly that at UNC in 2015</a> before returning to Wuhan to continue their work.<br />
A few years later the NIH would ban this dual-use “gain-of-function” research, a ban that would remain in place from 2014 until 2017, when it was lifted. And what was the reasoning behind lifting the ban? To allow for research on flu viruses, as well as SARS and MERS – coronaviruses just like our new friend, COVID-19. And so hundreds of millions of dollars of funding poured into research on these viruses, supposedly with oversight meant to reduce <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research">“the potential to create, transfer, or use an enhanced potential pandemic pathogen.”</a><br />
Turns out, that oversight might not have worked out too well, witnessed by the thousands who have already died from COVID-19.<br />
“But it is only a machine. It doesn’t think. It follows instructions. If we learn how to alter that programming, then we become the architects of that change.”<br />
And so since 2017 the floodgates have been opened, and money has poured in to fund gain-of-function research on coronaviruses, and they’ve been seen as everything from a potential base <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17162377">to create an HIV-vaccine from</a>, to being able to help scientists in their mission to create a universal vaccine against the flu and common cold. Unsurprisingly, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which helped bankroll Event 201, has also poured millions and millions of dollars <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-23/gates-predicts-two-miracles-for-aids-relief-to-occur-by-2030">into the search for a vaccine against HIV</a>, much of which is centered around harnessing coronaviruses.<br />
Gate’s previous forays into vaccination programs haven’t always gone so well, in 2009 a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/articleshow/41280050.cms">Gates-sponsored HPV vaccine from Merck</a> caused severe side effects among hundreds of the girls it was administered to, ultimately killing seven of them. In addition to the faulty science behind this vaccine program, was evidence that the majority of patients had no idea what they were signing up for, but were pushed through into treatment anyways. More unethical behavior was reported in the Gates-funded MenAfriVac campaign in Chad, which between 50 and 500 children vaccinated for meningitis <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccine-program-betrayal-public-trust-institutional-corruption-part-3-7/">were reported to develop paralysis</a>, leading a South African newspaper to announce that “we are guinea pigs for the drug-makers.” And there are a scattershot of other accounts covering possible malfeasance by Gates-funded vaccination programs all across the globe. So not that Bill Gates is personally punching little kids in the face, but that his well-meaning funding may end up in a lot of the wrong places in the blind pursuit for results, providing financing for very shady and entirely unethical practices.<br />
Pointing out the funding from their foundation isn’t meant to demonize the Gates family, only to begin to build the idea that accountability does’t lie with the scientists in Wuhan alone, or the Chinese Communist Party for trying to cover-up the beginning of the pandemic. And to point out that nothing about being a computer scientist or a businessman has anything to do with public health policy, or the scientific and social implications around gain-of-function research. Why the NIH allowed this really obvious Pandora’s Box to be reopened in the first place deserves to be answered, and the organizations funding this research should carry much of the blame as well – the NIH included, which <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8211291/U-S-government-gave-3-7million-grant-Wuhan-lab-experimented-coronavirus-source-bats.html">has provided the Wuhan Institute of virology with a $3.7 million grant</a>.<br />
Bill Gates might want to be an effective philanthropist really bad, and he may have been amazing at designing computer software and undercutting his competition – however that doesn’t a philanthropist make. After all, beyond the questionable tactics practiced by many of the vaccination programs he’s funded, his very well-intentioned attempt to save lives by <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191111100910.htm">providing  insecticidal mosquito-nets</a> was ultimately destructive: many of the villagers provided with the mosquito-nets decided they were better used as fishing-nets, resulting in food shortages due to over-fishing from the fact the nets smaller weave caught far too many juvenile fish, undercutting population growth.<br />
Seemed like a good idea at the time, right? Just like all those untested vaccines that were rushed into testing?<br />
“Distributed responsibility is the problem. One person gives the order, another carries it out. One can say they didn’t pull the trigger, the other that they were just doing what they were told, and everyone lets themselves off the hook.”<br />
Far more sinister than the Gates Foundation funding dual-use gain-of-function research is the involvement of scientists hoping exclusively to bankroll their own companies through this kind of work. <br />
While The Expanse had <a href="https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Jules-Pierre_Mao_(TV)">Jules-Pierre Mao</a>, a scientist-CEO who used his private company to hybridize the protomolecule – a mysterious apparently alien substance that seems to have a mind of its own – with humans to create unstoppable biological weapons, today we have <a href="https://twitter.com/peterdaszak/status/1243002682593488896?s=12">Peter Daszak</a>.  His company, EcoHealth Alliance, which is a non-profit that depends largely on multi-million dollar government grants to function, has been <a href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2018/04/ecohealth-alliance-announces-discovery-of-new-bat-origin-virus-impacting-pig-farms-in-southern-china">partnering with Chinese researchers for years</a> in an attempt to secure funding for more and more research into coronaviruses. At least they’re not really even pretending to be philanthropic.<br />
And in one of the more transparent attempts at blatant PR-spin, Daszak <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/">was featured alongside</a> one of the researchers who <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">learned how to create hyper-virulent bat coronaviruses</a> at UNC back in 2015, Zhengli Shi. Their article insists we should take Zhengli at her word when she claims to have not found a match after she checked COVID-19’s genome against everything in her lab. As if someone responsible for releasing the most virulent pathogen to hit humanity in modern history, one that’s already killed thousands and is projected to kill millions and millions more all across the globe, would simply fess-up to it, torpedoing her career and the years of research performed by her and her colleagues? And possibly opening all of them up to legal and other repercussions?<br />
If you still aren’t sure whether the scientists involved with kind of research are being forthright, there’s Dr. Ralph Baric. It was <a href="https://twitter.com/Baric_Lab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">in his lab at UNC</a> that a hyper-virulent bat Franken-virus was created by splicing a new protein-spike on an existing coronavirus, creating a monster so vicious that a virologist with the Louis Pasteur Institute of Paris warned: “If the [new] virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory.” It should also be noted that several years prior to tinkering directly with bat coronavirus spike-proteins, Baric orchestrated research that involved isolating a coronavirus from civets and then <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519660/">passing it through mammalian ACE2 receptor cells</a> that were grown in the lab from kidney and brain samples – serial passage through host cell lines instead of entire hosts, which imparted a strong affinity for ACE2, and presumably created an airborne strain of coronavirus. And if cells derived from kidneys and brains were used for the serial passage development of COVID-19, that might help explain its affinity for attacking <a href="https://www.cathlabdigest.com/content/are-kidneys-targeted-novel-coronavirus">the kidneys</a> <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200402/in-some-cases-covid-19-may-harm-the-brain#1">and brains</a> of its human hosts.<br />
Previous research done in the Wuhan lab looking at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2258702/">inserting HIV-like segments into coronaviruses that also target the ACE2 receptor</a> may also have played a role in the creation of COVID-19. One possible reason for these HIV-like segments is that they were meant to be epitopes, or molecular flags meant to mark intruders for a vaccine to target – meaning the Wuhan Strain was built as a monster for a specific vaccine to hunt. It is mathematically possible for this to happen in nature – but only in a ten-thousand bats chained to ten-thousand Petri dishes and given until infinity sense. Alternatively, <a href="https://twitter.com/R_H_Ebright/status/1229539901844094978">this pattern could also be produced</a> by infecting a room full of ferrets or tree shrews with a bespoke coronavirus and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215001531">sifting through the wreckage for your genomic needle</a>.<br />
So if he was being honest, you might expect Baric to warn the public about the lethal potential coronaviruses pose during our current outbreak. However, when he was asked if the public should be worried about COVID-19 he said that <a href="https://www.wral.com/unc-researcher-found-deadly-virus-in-bats-in-china-in-2015/18913313/?ref_id=18912862">people should be more worried about the seasonal flu</a>. Pretty bizarre statement from a scientist who knew full well how dangerous coronaviruses could be, especially given the fact that not only was Zhengli Shi working in his lab on that project in 2015, but Xing-Yi Ge was too. Both of whom returned to Wuhan where they’ve continued their work for years.<br />
Xing-Yi Ge is especially notable since in 2013 he became the very first scientist to isolate a bat coronavirus from nature <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Isolation-and-characterization-of-a-bat-SARS-like-Ge-Li/417a4b342beca09814e4379b73eda308d7997274">that uses the ACE2 receptor</a>, which is found in human, tree shrew, and ferret lungs and allows coronaviruses to become airborne. And as you might have learned by now, that’s the exact receptor used by COVID-19 to enter human cells – if anyone would know how to finagle that part of the coronavirus genome, it’d be him. So both Xing-Yi Ge and Zhengli Shi were part of the research team that created this hybridized hyper-virulent bat coronavirus under Baric, who’s actively downplayed the risk posed by COVID-19, and then returned to work in Wuhan, where funding provided in part by Daszak’s company allowed them to continue their work on coronaviruses with plenty of research to cut-and-paste into their work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Disease Engineering Technical Research Center.<br />
And as Dr. Ian Malcolm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNX6XJOeGU">puts it in Jurassic Park</a>, it is never a good idea to futz around with science and research when you don’t fully understand it, nor its possible implications.<br />
However it wasn’t just Daszak funding their work, Zhengli also secured millions of dollars in grant money from various American institutions including our Department of Defense as well as the U.S. Biological Defense Research Directorate, and millions more from other foreign governments.<br />
So although the Chinese Communist Party deserves its share of the blame for attempting to cover the outbreak up, arresting the heroic scientists trying to warn us and issuing gag-orders and the destruction of evidence, this research likely wouldn’t have occurred at all if the NIH hadn’t lifted the ban on gain-of-function research in the first place. And it was funded directly by American tax dollars, by government officials willing to let others play god at their behest.<br />
But now that the virus is out of the lab, are the private entities responsible for its creation going to bear any of the blame at all? Or will America and China continue to point fingers at each other until the worst happens?<br />
“Mars will accuse Earth of using a bio-weapon. Earth will claim it was Mars. The Belt will blame the other two. It’s a good way to start a war and cover it up.”<br />
One last spoiler warning… okay, so in The Expanse the central plot device pushing things forward is the discovery of a mysterious substance dubbed the protomolecule, which seems to have a mind of its own and seek out radiation as sustenance before then beginning “the Work,” a mysterious intergalactic goal that isn’t revealed until later seasons.<br />
And it’s not individual nations who first attempt to harness the protomolecule, but their Peter Daszak, the aforementioned scientist and CEO named Jules-Pierre Mao, who attempts to weave it into the genomes of immuno-compromised children to create hybridized super-soldiers. Not for his own private army, but as a game-changing bio-weapon he’ll sell to whichever government is willing to pay the most for it. So in The Expanse, it takes amoral scientists as well as the collusion of officials affiliated with both governments for this research to happen and be hidden, and when these Hybrids are eventually dropped between both armies the carnage is immense.<br />
Luckily, we haven’t gotten that far on earth yet, but the rhetoric between America and China <a href="https://twitter.com/RepStefanik/status/1242462897181282304">has been heading in that direction</a> – it’s been growing increasingly hostile as each blames the other for starting the pandemic and covering it up, with China even going so far as to threaten to cut off our supply of antibiotics and other life-saving medical goods.  Meanwhile Daszak, Baric, Zhengli, and others sit back counting their lucky stars and their money, since both governments and the public at large seem to have bought their story that there’s no way this virus leaked out of one of their labs, and every government on earth now wants to harness their research to help create vaccines and treatments.<br />
And these researchers have been assisted by <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/03/19/china-owns-nature-magazines-ass-debunking-the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2-claiming-covid-19-wasnt-from-a-lab/">scientifically spurious</a> and journalistically vacuous articles which mindlessly regurgitate claims from the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/who-china-taiwan-interview">and its scientific propaganda arm</a>, the WHO, about how bad the outbreak was in the past and how contained it is now. As the Chinese government arrested whistle-blowers and sent agents out into the street in bio-hazard gear while carrying automatic weapons to detain anyone suspected of breaking quarantine, while <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703503427818">literally welding apartment buildings shut,</a> the American media fawned over China’s “decisive and heroic” actions.<br />
Please take a moment to consider the fact that almost everyone reading the news to you on television was selected due to their connections or how photogenic they are, not because of any actual journalistic chops or ability to think critically.<br />
So as two superpowers are pushed closer and closer to conflict, the research that’s almost certainly the source of COVID-19 not only continues unabated, but if anything talk of more funding to stop this sort of supposedly natural pandemic from happening again is pouring into the pockets of the people who, if they weren’t directly responsible, should certainly have been at the forefront of warning the world about the risks posed by lab-altered coronaviruses, and been disclosing the existence of this sort of research in the first place.<br />
Oddly, each and everyone one of them is pretending that viral dual-use gain-of-function research has never occurred at all. Or not so oddly, when you stop and think about how much they have to lose if their role in this pandemic is revealed.<br />
“The hardest part of this game is figuring out who the enemy really is.”<br />
Other than the fact it doesn’t bear the direct marks of genetic tampering, just like the engineered hyper-virulent H5N1 Bird Flu, there’s literally nothing natural about COVID-19’s behavior or clinical presentation. And hauntingly, peer-reviewed research has noted that a crucial region of its genome “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354220300528">may provide a gain-of-function… for efficient spreading in the human population.”</a><br />
Not only is it so distant from any other coronavirus that it forms its own clade, but there isn’t even a natural path for it to have emerged through – assertions about pangolins have always been dubious at best, but were even further debunked when analysis of COVID-19’s genome at the regions that most accurately show heritage made it <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463">“very unlikely”</a> that pangolins had ever been involved at all.<br />
Beyond that is the fact that its affinity for the ACE2 receptor is<a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/"> somewhere between 10 and 20 times higher than SARS</a>, and it also creates viral loads thousands of times higher than SARS. These two characteristics point towards <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725690">COVID-19 using antibody-dependent enhancement</a>, or ADE, to enter human cells. This is when the virus is able to hijack white blood cells or other antiviral proteins to more easily enter into the rest of our body’s cells, allowing it to seep deep into its hosts’ nervous systems, creating permanent neurological damage in the hosts it doesn’t kill outright. More supporting evidence that ADE is occurring with COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9">arrived in a paper from April 2020</a>, which indicated that the novel coronavirus is targeting two different types white blood cells incredibly efficiently, especially compared to SARS which hardly binds to white blood cells at all in comparison. Since those types of cells have almost no ACE2 receptors, it appears that COVID-19 is using another method to efficiently enter those cells – with ADE at the top of the list of possibilities, although it’s not demonstrated here.<br />
ADE could also explain why <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/27/822407626/mystery-in-wuhan-recovered-coronavirus-patients-test-negative-then-positive">between 5% and 10% of once “recovered” patients in Wuhan</a> have been showing up with fresh infections and nearly 100 once-cured patients in South Korea have also had their infections return, since ADE allows a virus to hijack the antibodies created by a previous infection to re-attack an old host. And curiously Zhengli Shi, of UNC and Wuhan fame, <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/5/e02015-19">co-authored a 2019 paper</a> which used inert viral shells to figure out exactly how SARS, with its affinity to the ACE2 receptor just like COVID-19, was able to harness ADE to hijack white blood cells for enhanced cell entry. A gain-of-function extension of this research would be exactly the kind of experiment that could’ve given birth to COVID-19, especially considering that 2019 paper managed to fine-tune the exact concentration of antibodies that would best facilitate ADE.<br />
And alarming evidence that this phenomenon is occurring emerged from a Chinese pre-print which noted that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500v1">over one-third of the roughly 200 patients studied has some neurological symptoms</a>, with nearly half of the most severe patients exhibiting neurological issues. And further evidence for the possibility of ADE is witnessed by a study published in Lancet, which notes that the case fatality rate in Wuhan <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30195-X/fulltext#.XnEYqwyWDUE.twitter">could actually be as high as 20%</a> – the outbreak’s epicenter would be expected to have the highest rates of ADE as different variants of the Wuhan Strain infected and reinfected overlapping hosts.<br />
Both HIV and Dengue Fever use antibody-dependent enhancement to boost their virulence, however it’s generally a phenomenon that takes a long time to occur when it happens in nature. However COVID-19 looks like it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9">may have had its ADE jacked into hyper-drive</a> as it was passed between a series of animal hosts, since it has the aforementioned much stronger ability to bind to host cells and creates viral loads orders of magnitude higher, and also appears to immediately be able to enter its hosts’ nervous systems, killing many of its victims by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25728">attacking the region of the brain that controls breathing</a>, drastically lowering white blood cell counts early on in infections, and apparently re-infecting individuals who had already appeared to clear their infection.<br />
Nothing about COVID-19’s clinical presentation is typical, including the fact that in many patients the first sign of infection <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/24/coronavirus-symptoms-loss-smell-taste/2897385001/">seems to be losing your senses of smell and taste</a> without any other symptoms, something no other virus on earth is known to do to otherwise asymptomatic patients – but which could possibly be due to artificially enhanced ADE immediately gaining entry into those nerve cells and frying them. Further increasing the possibility that COVID-19’s unique clinical presentation may be due to its ADE being juiced by laboratory engineering, are the observations from an ER doctor who’s stated that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq6YEYfn2zw">“I have seen things that I have never seen before…</a> I have witnessed medical phenomenon that just don’t make sense in the context of treating a disease that is supposed to be viral pneumonia.” In an interview with Medscape, Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell went on to say that the closest thing to the symptoms he was witnessing in his emergency room were those <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/928156">created by altitude sickness</a>.<br />
This condition occurs when the organs that sense the level of oxygen concentration in the air you breathe notice that level decreasing, and begin a cascade of physiological changes that, as the COVID-19 patients horrifically showcase, can quickly turn deadly when they throw your body’s balance out of wack. And since these organs are <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-respiratory-system/Chemoreceptors">found in your neck right next to your carotid arteries</a>, it is well within the realm of possibility that after frying the nerve cells that control smell and taste, that if the viral load becomes large enough, that the infection may eventually move into these organs and fry them too – tricking your nervous system into miscommunicating the concentration of oxygen in the environment, and scrambling the same system that’s used when your body is subjected to the lowered oxygen levels that occur at high altitude and possibly tricking your body into reducing the number of red blood cells it produces.<br />
And it turns out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9">the receptor targeted</a> when COVID-19 targets white blood cells, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basigin">Basign</a> or CD147, is also the same receptor targeted by the malarial parasite to bind to red blood cells. Which is especially notable since hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, both antimalarial drugs, are involved in a roiling debate about their efficacy and safety to treat COVID-19 infections. However one thing is becoming clear: this novel coronavirus <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85865?fbclid=IwAR0tuiVzV9pPKOc-YAHS2SHP1BCVDytS_SfbIYJa-MxJknVL42zOfspOdjo">is creating clotting issues</a> in many of its patients, indicating along with the appearance of altitude sickness that COVID-19 may be able to attack our red blood cells as well as our white blood cells, since its spike-protein does bind with white blood cells through Basign, which is also found on red blood cells – opening the door for ADE to enhance this effect on both types of cell. And with COVID-19’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9">remarkably high affinity for white blood cells</a> compared to other coronaviruses, if ADE is occurring its effects could be creating a devastating physiological cascade.</p>
<p>Additionally, an unnaturally juiced-up ability to use ADE would also explain much of what other front-line medical workers are <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-medical-worker-describes--terrifying-lung-failure-from-covid19-even-in-his-young-patients">observing in their patients</a>: “I’m seeing people who look relatively healthy with a minimal health history, and they are completely wiped out, like they’ve been hit by a truck. This is knocking out what should be perfectly fit, healthy people. Patients will be on minimal support, on a little bit of oxygen, and then all of a sudden, they go into complete respiratory arrest, shut down and can’t breathe at all… That seems to be what happens to a lot of these patients: They suddenly become unresponsive or go into respiratory failure.” This sort of sudden precipitous decline is exactly what would be expected if COVID-19’s ability to use ADE had been accentuated in the lab, and would also explain the clinical observations that “this severity of [acute respiratory distress] is usually more typical of someone who has a near drowning experience — they have a bunch of dirty water in their lungs — or people who inhale caustic gas. Especially for it to have such an acute onset like that. I’ve never seen a microorganism or an infectious process cause such acute damage to the lungs so rapidly. That was what really shocked me.”<br />
And also the following horrific account: “Holy shit, this is not the flu. Watching this relatively young guy, gasping for air, pink frothy secretions coming out of his tube and out of his mouth. The ventilator should have been doing the work of breathing but he was still gasping for air, moving his mouth, moving his body, struggling. We had to restrain him. With all the coronavirus patients, we’ve had to restrain them. They really hyperventilate, really struggle to breathe. When you’re in that mindstate of struggling to breathe and delirious with fever, you don’t know when someone is trying to help you, so you’ll try to rip the breathing tube out because you feel it is choking you, but you are drowning.”<br />
Given everything else we know about COVID-19’s unusual and atypical genome, the fact that its clinical presentation sure doesn’t appear to follow the course of a natural viral infection should only raise our collective eyebrows further when “experts” insist there’s no indication that it leaked out of lab.<br />
“I thought if you told people facts, they’d draw their own conclusions, and because the facts were true, the conclusions mostly would be too. But we don’t run on facts. We run on stories about things. About people.”<br />
In ancient China there was a tradition of developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_(poison)">a special poison called Gu</a> by throwing as many venomous creatures as you could find into a jar and sealing them in until only one was left. Also known as a “golden-silkworm,” this victorious creature was then thought to host a “demonic poison” since every other creature’s venom was thought to concentrate within it. According to Chinese folklore, this golden-silkworm could then mutate itself into any number of other animals – retaining its lethal ability no matter what form it took.<br />
Turns out that manipulating nature in an attempt to create unpredictable and  unnaturally powerful weapons is nothing new.<br />
No one knows exactly how many people have died in Wuhan, where in January and February crematoriums were running 24/7 when they’d typically only be operational for four hours a day and five days a week, but one apparent pattern is that the longer the virus was allowed to circulate and spit off new variants, the more lethal it became as new saves used ADE to dig into their hosts’ immune systems. Further evidence that far more lives were lost in Wuhan than the Chinese government is disclosing is provided by the fact that <a href="https://www.ibtimes.sg/china-hiding-covid-19-death-toll-21-million-cell-phones-disappeared-why-41580">some 21 million cell phone users</a> have somehow fallen of the map in China, as well as the long lines witnessed to collect loved ones’ ashes in Wuhan, which alone is reported to have had <a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Wuhan,-endless-queues-for-ashes-of-coronavirus-dead-cast-doubts-on-numbers-49673.html">some 45,000 cremations</a>. So this high lethality may be due in part to the multiple variants that had time to circulate in Wuhan, a hallmark of ADE since each subsequent variant is able to escape detection by our immune systems <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057165/">while still hijacking our white blood cells</a> to increase its virulence.<br />
And unsurprisingly, neither ADE nor the possibility that COVID-19 could be a product of dual-use gain-of-function serial animal passage has been mentioned on television by the virologists most likely to be able to identify these phenomena, meaning our front-line medical responders are being blindsided by a virus that’s not behaving like anything natural, like anything they’ve ever seen.<br />
Even more indicative of an unnatural origin is the fact that the process of a virus transferring from one species to another, called a zoonotic jump, follows a well-established pattern in the literature. <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">For a virus to fully jump into a new species</a>, several months if not years are required for the process to complete. First a variant of the virus infects one new host, an infection that will fizzle out the first time it happens since there’s no way for a virus to be immediately adapted to a novel host species. But with continued exposure, more individual infections occur, some of which produce slightly mutated variants more adapted to the biology of the new host species, until eventually a variant wins the selective virulent lottery and is able to spread easily among its new host population, killing and reproducing as it goes.<br />
And yet <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12250-018-0012-7">research published in 2018</a> found that only two-point-seven percent of villagers living about a kilometer from local bat-caves carried any evidence of past bat coronavirus infections. That study happened to examine people living in Wuhan as well, and found absolutely zero evidence of previous bat coronavirus infection at all there, making it all-but-impossible that zoonotic jumping occurred since earlier less-lethal variants of the virus would have left a wide signature in its new host population. Instead, COVID-19 emerged out of nowhere, or more likely just out of a local lab, and was immediately extraordinarily well-adapted to humans – spreading through the air with ease, killing as it went. Plus there’s the fact that all the initial victims were infected with the same variant, if a natural zoonotic jump had occurred, multiple different variants would inevitably have been found at the start of an outbreak.<br />
And so as our titular quote alludes to, although its certainly possible to train a monkey to warm up a frozen burrito in a microwave, it’s pretty damn unlikely that a wild monkey that’d never been in contact with humans before could be presented with a frozen burrito and a microwave, and figure out to heat up a snack.<br />
In the same way, everything about the way COVID-19 interacts with its human hosts and spreads among them indicates that it’s been artificially trained to be familiar with human biology – bizarrely blocking our senses of smell and taste before doing anything else, spreading readily among asymptomatic patients and then infecting and killing us with far more efficiency than any natural emergent virus at the start of its outbreak, and first emerging without taking any of the steps necessary to naturally perform a zoonotic jump into humans.<br />
At some point in the next few weeks, Americans will literally be dropping dead in the streets, collapsing curbside as they already have in China, Italy, and Iran.<br />
And while the people on your television will be parroting whatever their corporate parents tell them to, and while the scientists intimately involved in this kind of research preen as “having told you so” about the threat coronaviruses pose instead of informing the public about how truly grave the threat we face is – millions will die, and the work that caused this pandemic will continue at an accelerating pace as funding for gain-of-function research pours in.<br />
“Nothing ever killed more people than being afraid to look like a sissy.”<br />
As we’re quite fond of saying, America is a free country. And without sensible federal guidance, and with our pandemic response team being undermined by economic advisers and relatives with only the vaguest grasp of how science works, let alone epidemiology, we are very quickly approaching what might be our last inflection point.<br />
While the Olympics have been postponed for the first time in modern history and other nations from New Zealand to France lock-down entirely for at least the coming several weeks, Americans haven’t been convinced not to crowd into public places and public transportation. Supposedly, prayer, toughness, and the American Spirit are going to work as effective anti-viral treatments.<br />
So by the time the public and our officials collectively realize that COVID-19 has no intention of behaving anything close to like the flu does, or like any natural virus ever has, and that our front-line healthcare workers have been <a href="https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/">effectively battling a biological weapon</a> for weeks, the deaths of millions more Americans will already be inevitable.<br />
The current push to get the economy back on track leads only to human carnage, rushing back into the virus’s maws can’t possibly lead anywhere good. Slowing down to get the full picture of what’s going on is apparently off the table, as is any sort of reasoned discussion about how to save the most lives while still being able to keep the economy in stasis until the pandemic is under control. And so America will be forever changed by this pandemic, as our once-trusted institutions lead us directly to slaughter.<br />
Rushing into danger has never ended well. After all, it’s always the doors and corners where they get you.</p>

<p><em>coronavirus’s ability to mutate has been vastly underestimated, and mutations affect deadliness of strains, chinese study finds</em><br />
stephen chen 2020<br />
<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3080771/coronavirus-mutations-affect-deadliness-strains-chinese-study">scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3080771/coronavirus-mutations-affect-deadliness-strains-chinese-study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The most aggressive strains of Sars-CoV-2 could generate 270 times as much viral load as the least potent type New York may have a deadlier strain imported from Europe, compared to less deadly viruses elsewhere in the United States<br />
Li’s study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused disease or damage in its host.<br />
Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation. She analysed the viral strains isolated from 11 randomly chosen Covid-19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells.<br />
The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe, while the milder strains were the predominant varieties found in parts of the United States, such as Washington state, according to their paper.<br />
A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe. The death rate in New York was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse.<br />
But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li’s study. In Zhejiang, two patients in their 30s and 50s who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit.</p>
<p>This finding could shed light on differences in regional mortality. The pandemic’s infection and death rates vary from one country to another, and many explanations have been proposed.<br />
Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations but they had no direct proof.<br />
The issue was further complicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age, underlying health conditions or even blood type.<br />
In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region might determine actions to fight the virus.<br />
“Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations … into account to avoid potential pitfalls,” they said.<br />
Li was the<br />
<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3078189/build-coronavirus-lockdown-inside-chinas-decision-close-wuhan">first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown,</a><br />
according to state media reports. The government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11 million residents was shut down overnight.<br />
The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small. Other studies tracking the virus mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, of strains.<br />
Li’s team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations – or about 60 per cent – were new.<br />
They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus’ spike protein, a unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavirus to bind with human cells. Computer simulation predicted that these mutations would increase its infectivity.<br />
To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutations. The most aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also killed the cells the fastest.<br />
It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, “indicating that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated,” Li wrote in the paper.</p>
<p>The mutations were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late December last year.<br />
The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than 10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300 mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation.<br />
Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result quickly. The genes were read just once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes.<br />
Li’s team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have been overlooked by the conventional approach.</p>
<p>The researchers also found three consecutive changes – known as tri-nucleotide mutations – in a 60-year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces were infectious with living viral strains.<br />
“Investigating the functional impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting,” Li and colleagues said in the paper.<br />
Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective strategy to track the virus’ mutation.<br />
“It can produce some useful information,” he said.<br />
But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all samples.<br />
“Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow,” Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in many others still left scientists scratching their heads.<br />
“If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don’t be surprised.”</p>

<p><em>aerosol filtration efficiency of common fabrics used in respiratory cloth masks</em><br />
abhiteja konda et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252</a></p>
<ul>
<li>researchers used an aerosol mixing chamber to produce particles ranging from 10 nm to 6 μm in diameter. A fan blew the aerosol across various cloth samples at an airflow rate corresponding to a person's respiration at rest, and the team measured the number and size of particles in air before and after passing through the fabric. One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of polyester-spandex chiffon -- a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns -- filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material. Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results. The researchers point out that tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton, can act as a mechanical barrier to particles, whereas fabrics that hold a static charge, like certain types of chiffon and natural silk, serve as an electrostatic barrier. However, a 1% gap reduced the filtering efficiency of all masks by half or more, emphasizing the importance of a properly fitted mask.</li>
<li><em>abstract</em> The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 μm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of &lt;300 nm and &gt;300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton–silk, cotton–chiffon, cotton–flannel) was &gt;80% (for particles &lt;300 nm) and &gt;90% (for particles &gt;300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (<em>i.e.</em>, thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of “fit” and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.</li>

<p><em>mathematical modeling of interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses in covid‐19 and implications for viral pathogenesis</em><br />
sean quan du, weiming yuan 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25866">http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25866</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>temporarily suppressing the body's immune system during the early stages of COVID-19 could help a patient avoid severe symptoms.</p>
<p>That's because the research, just published online in the <em>Journal of Medical Virology</em>, shows that an interaction between the body's two main lines of defense may be causing the immune system to go into overdrive in some patients.<br />
The body's first line of defense, the innate immune response, starts right after an infection, like an infantry going after a foreign invader, killing the virus and any cells damaged by it. The second line of defense, the adaptive immune response, kicks in days later if any virus remains, employing what it has learned about the virus to mobilize a variety of special forces such as T cells and B cells.<br />
Using the &quot;target cell-limited model,&quot; a common mathematical model developed to understand the dynamics of viral infections, the researchers examined how the two immune responses work in COVID-19 patients compared to patients who have the flu.<br />
The flu is a fast-moving infection that attacks certain target cells on the surface of the upper respiratory system and kills almost all of the target cells within two to three days. The death of these cells deprives the virus of more targets to infect and allows the innate immune response time to clear the body of almost all of the virus before the adaptive system comes into play.<br />
<strong>Adaptive immune response kicking in too soon</strong><br />
But COVID-19, which targets surface cells throughout the respiratory system including in the lungs, has an average incubation of six days and a much slower disease progression. Mathematical modeling suggests that the adaptive immune response may kick in before the target cells are depleted, slowing down the infection and interfering with the innate immune response's ability to kill off most of the virus quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger is, as the infection keeps going on, it will mobilize the whole of the adaptive immune response with its multiple layers,&quot; said Weiming Yuan, associate professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and co-corresponding author of the study. &quot;This longer duration of viral activity may lead to an overreaction of the immune system, called a cytokine storm, which kills healthy cells, causing tissue damage.&quot;<br />
The interaction of the innate and the adaptive immune responses might also explain why some COVID-19 patients experience two waves of the disease, appearing to get better before eventually getting much worse.<br />
&quot;Some COVID-19 patients may experience a resurgence of the disease after an apparent easing of symptoms,&quot; said Sean Du, adjunct researcher and lead author of the study. &quot;It's possible that the combined effect of the adaptive and the innate immune responses may reduce the virus to a low level temporarily. However, if the virus is not completely cleared, and the target cells regenerate, the virus can take hold again and reach another peak.&quot;<br />
<strong>Counterintuitive treatment</strong><br />
The most provocative result of the research is the kind of treatment it suggests to prevent this interaction between the two immune responses.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on the results of the mathematical modeling, we proposed a counterintuitive idea that a short regimen of a proper immunosuppressant drug applied early in the disease process may improve a patient's outcome,&quot; said Du. &quot;With the right suppressive agent, we may be able to delay the adaptive immune response and prevent it from interfering with the innate immune response, which enables faster elimination of the virus and the infected cells.&quot;<br />
Small studies out of China, including a recent one of COVID-19 patients and one of SARS patients in 2003 show patients who received immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids had better results than those who did not.<br />
The researchers said a possible next step could be to take daily measurements of viral loads and other biomarkers in COVID-19 patients, to see if the data validates the mathematical modeling. More preclinical studies including experiments in animal models will also be needed to prove the efficacy of an early immune suppressing treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. We first validated our model using the well‐studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID‐19 patients. Specifically the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on the disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID‐19 patients are more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID‐19 patients while enhancing the viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID‐19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high risk COVID‐19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.</p>

<p><em>a multibasic cleavage site in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is essential for infection of human lung cells</em><br />
markus hoffmann et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.022</a><br />
&quot;The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 carries an activation sequence at the so-called S1/S2 cleavage site, which is similar to those observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, but which has so far not been found in viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects lung cells and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The viral spike protein mediates entry of the virus into host cells and harbors an unusual activation sequence. The Infection Biology Unit of the German Primate Center (DPZ) -- Leibniz Institute for Primate Research has now shown that this sequence is cleaved by the cellular enzyme furin and that the cleavage is important for the infection of lung cells. These results define new starting points for therapy and vaccine research. In addition, they provide information on how coronaviruses from animals need to change in order to be able to spread in the human population (<em>Molecular Cell</em>).<br />
The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted from animals to humans and is spreading worldwide. It causes the new lung disease COVID-19, which has already killed over 200,000 people. The spike protein on the virus surface serves as a key for the virus to enter host cells. It facilitates viral attachment to cells and fuses the viral with a cellular membrane, thereby allowing the virus to deliver its genome into the cell, which is essential for viral replication. For this, activation sequences of the spike protein need to be cleaved by cellular enzymes, called proteases. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 carries an activation sequence at the so-called S1/S2 cleavage site, which is similar to those observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, but which has so far not been found in viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. The importance of this sequence for the virus was so far unknown.<br />
In their current study, the infection biologists of the German Primate Center led by Markus Hoffmann and Stefan Pöhlmann were able to show that the S1/S2 activation sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is cleaved by the cellular protease furin and that this cleavage event is essential for the infection of lung cells. It is also important for the fusion of infected cells with non-infected cells, which might allow the virus to spread in the body without leaving the host cell.<br />
&quot;Our results suggest that inhibition of furin should block the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung,&quot; says Stefan Pöhlmann, head of the Infection Biology Unit at DPZ. &quot;Furthermore, our present study and previous work demonstrate that the virus uses a two-step activation mechanism: In infected cells, the spike protein has to be cleaved by the protease furin so that newly formed viruses can then use the protease TMPRSS2 for further cleavage of the spike protein, which is important for the entry into lung cells.&quot;<br />
<strong>Development of live attenuated vaccines</strong><br />
For a live attenuated vaccine to trigger a strong immune response, it has to be able to replicate in the body to a limited extent, for example locally at the site of injection. &quot;SARS-CoV-2 variants, in which the activation sequence for furin has been removed, could be used as a basis for the development of such live attenuated vaccines, since the lack of cleavage of the spike protein should greatly limit the spread of the virus in the body. A sufficiently attenuated virus would no longer be able to cause disease, but would still enable the immune system to react to the pathogen and, for example, produce neutralizing antibodies,&quot; says Markus Hoffmann, first author of the study.<br />
<strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />
In wildlife, especially bats, a large number of coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered over the past 20 years. However, so far an S1/S2 activation sequence that can be cleaved by furin has only been detected in SARS-CoV-2. &quot;Wildlife sampling and the targeted search for coronaviruses with a focus on the S1/S2 activation sequence is necessary to identify those viruses that have the potential to infect and efficiently spread in humans. In addition, in the case of potential future coronavirus outbreaks, we should specifically analyze the S1/S2 cleavage site as it might serve as a marker for human-to-human transmissibility,&quot; says Markus Hoffmann.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a multibasic S1/S2 site<br />
•The host cell protease furin cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 site<br />
•Cleavage at the S1/S2 site is essential for spike-driven viral entry into lung cells</p>
<p>The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

&quot;To their surprise, they found that the virus infected cells with both high and low levels of the ACE2 receptor&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>can infect cells of the intestine and multiply there. Using state-of-the-art cell culture models of the human intestine, the researchers have successfully propagated the virus in vitro, and monitored the response of the cells to the virus, providing a new cell culture model for the study of COVID-19. These findings could explain the observation that approximately one third of COVID-19 patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, and the fact that the virus often can be detected in stool samples.<br />
The results of this study were published in the scientific journal <em>Science</em> on May 1, 2020.<br />
Patients with COVID-19 show a variety of symptoms associated with respiratory organs -- such as coughing, sneezing, shortness of breath, and fever -- and the disease is transmitted via tiny droplets that are spread mainly through coughing and sneezing. One third of the patients however also have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and diarrhea. In addition, the virus can be detected in human stool long after the respiratory symptoms have been resolved. This suggests that the virus can also spread via so-called &quot;fecal-oral transmission.&quot;<br />
Though the respiratory and gastrointestinal organs may seem very different, there are some key similarities. A particularly interesting similarity is the presence of the ACE2 receptor, the receptor through which the COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the cells. The inside of the intestine is loaded with ACE2 receptors. However, until now it was unknown whether intestinal cells could actually get infected and produce virus particles.<br />
<strong>Intestinal organoids</strong><br />
Researchers from the Hubrecht Institute, Erasmus MC and Maastricht University set out to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect the cells of the intestine, and if so, whether it can replicate there as well. They used human intestinal organoids: tiny versions of the human intestine that can be grown in the lab. Hans Clevers (Hubrecht Institute): &quot;These organoids contain the cells of the human intestinal lining, making them a compelling model to investigate infection by SARS-CoV-2.&quot;<br />
<strong>Infection of intestinal cells</strong><br />
When the researchers added the virus to the organoids, they were rapidly infected. The virus enters a subset of the cells in the intestinal organoids, and the number of cells that are infected increases over time. Using electron microscopy, an advanced way to visualize different components of the cell in great detail, the researchers found virus particles inside and outside the cells of the organoids. Peter Peters (Maastricht University): &quot;Due to the lockdown, we all studied virtual slides of the infected organoids remotely from home.&quot;<br />
The researchers investigated the response of the intestinal cells to the virus with RNA sequencing, a method to study which genes are active in the cells. This revealed that so-called interferon stimulated genes are activated. These genes are known to combat viral infection. Future work will focus on these genes more carefully, and on how they could be used to develop new treatments.<br />
The researchers also cultured the organoids in different conditions that result in cells with higher and lower levels of the ACE2 receptor, through which SARS-CoV-2 can enter the cells. To their surprise, they found that the virus infected cells with both high and low levels of the ACE2 receptor. Ultimately, these studies may lead to new ways to block the entry of the virus into our cells.<br />
<strong>Implications</strong><br />
Bart Haagmans (Erasmus MC): &quot;The observations made in this study provide definite proof that SARS-CoV-2 can multiply in cells of the gastrointestinal tract. However, we don't yet know whether SARS-CoV-2, present in the intestines of COVID-19 patients, plays a significant role in transmission. Our findings indicate that we should look into this possibility more closely.&quot; The current study is in line with other recent studies that identified gastrointestinal symptoms in a large fraction of COVID-19 patients and virus in the stool of patients free of respiratory symptoms. Special attention may be needed for those patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. More extensive testing using not only nose and throat swabs, but also rectal swabs or stool samples may thus be needed.<br />
In the meantime, the researchers are continuing their collaboration to learn more about COVID-19. They are studying the differences between infections in the lung and the intestine by comparing lung and intestinal organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an influenza-like disease that is primarily thought to infect the lungs with transmission via the respiratory route. However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by confocal- and electron-microscopy. Consequently, significant titers of infectious viral particles were detected. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program. Hence, intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology</p>
